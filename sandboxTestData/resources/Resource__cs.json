The study included hundreds of participants, either with autism or without the disorder.</p><p>The autism group had prolonged connectivity (up to 20 seconds) between brain areas, while those links faded much more quickly in people without autism, the findings showed.</p><p>The researchers also found that the autism symptoms increased with the duration of connectivity between brain regions.</p><p>\"This is a whole new perspective into how autism works in the brain, and can help us develop strategies for treatment and finding medications that might be more effective to ease the symptoms of the disorder,\" Anderson said in a university news release.</p><p>One in every 59 children in the United States has an autism spectrum disorder, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They typically have difficulty with communication, repetitive behaviors and socializing. Symptoms may range from mild to severe.</p><p>According to study first author Jace King, the findings provide researchers \"with new tools to figure out the mechanisms that may underlie autism.\" King is  a postdoctoral research associate in the university's Brain Network Lab.</p><p>But Anderson said the team first needs to validate the results from this analysis in other groups of people. </p><p>The study was published online recently in <i>JAMA Network Open</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\" https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/index.html \" target=\"_new\">autism</a>.</p>",

This could help reduce the spread of the disease, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.</p><p>Called a \"point-of-care\" test, the screening gives accurate results 93 percent of the time for a positive result and 99 percent of the time for a negative result, the investigators found. The study was funded by the U.S. National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB).</p><p>\"Point-of-care tests for STDs are making significant progress towards being highly sensitive, specific and easy to read within a short wait time,\" Tiffani Bailey Lash said in an institute news release. She is director of NIBIB programs in point-of-care technologies. </p><p>Study leader Charlotte Gaydos said the goal of point-of-care technology is to deliver quick results and give patients more options. </p><p>\"A patient should be able to choose if he/she comes into a clinic, goes to a pharmacy, or takes a test at home for STD diagnosis; the bottom line is to encourage people to get tested,\" said Gaydos, a professor of infectious diseases.</p><p>People with STDs often don't have obvious symptoms, which means they can unknowingly spread the diseases. Currently, patients wait two to 14 days for STD test results, and those who have been tested have low rates of return to receive results, counseling and treatment.</p><p>Women with untreated chlamydia can develop pelvic inflammatory disease. In men, untreated chlamydia can cause urethral infection and complications such as swollen and tender testicles.</p><p>The Johns Hopkins team is collaborating on a clinical trial that could lead to the approval of a chlamydia and gonorrhea point-of-care test in the United States.</p><p>The need is urgent, the researchers said.

However, one aspect of recordkeeping -- how often to get on the scale -- has been the subject of much debate.</p><p>Daily weigh-ins used to be thought of as negative, capable of discouraging you if the pounds didn't come off fast enough, or if day-to-day fluctuations were frustrating. But more recent research has found that it can be a powerful motivator.</p><p>While there's a lot more to dropping pounds than just getting on the scale, weighing yourself can be an important part of the plan. One study found participants achieved weight loss success with daily self-monitoring that included a weigh-in, counting steps and recording fruit, vegetable and water intake.</p><p>Stepping on the scale every day can also help you avoid the natural tendency to gain weight as you age by alerting you early on should pounds sneak on, enabling you to adjust your calorie intake. And, equally important, it plays a role in maintaining weight loss.</p><p>Surveys show that people who successfully keep weight off are more likely to weigh themselves frequently as part of their maintenance plan. The scale in essence functions as an early warning detection system, showing you if your weight starts to creep up.</p><p>The problem is that, over time, people lose interest in tracking their weight, said University of Pittsburgh researchers who followed a group of dieters for a year and a half. Even though weigh-ins helped with weight loss over the first 6 months, adherence to using the scale progressively declined over the following year.</p><p>The answer is to make getting on the scale as much of a habit as brushing your teeth, and to log your weight every day, whether you use your computer, smartphone or an old-school paper record.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Consumer Reports has more tips on <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/scales/the-best-time-to-weigh-yourself/\" target=\"_new\">the best ways to weigh yourself</a> for accuracy and motivation.</p>",

In fact, she was planning to franchise a popular workshop that offers classes devoted to the activity.</p> <p>\"You go in with friends, drink wine and make a custom piece of wooden pallet art for your home decor,\" she said. \"It's fun.\" Unfortunately, fate had other plans.</p> <p>One morning in February 2017, while getting her children ready for school, Amy felt a heavy sensation in her chest. Her arms began to ache so badly that she couldn't finish brushing her daughter's hair. Within minutes, her skin turned pale and she started to hyperventilate. </p> <p>Although Amy had never experienced a panic attack, that was her best guess about what was happening. </p> <p>\"What else could it be?\" she said. After all, she was young, healthy and active, regularly participating in spinning classes and playing competitive tennis matches against her husband, John Paul.</p> <p>Admittedly stubborn by nature, Amy was adamant that John Paul not dial 911. He did it anyway. Her stubborn streak continued when the paramedics arrived. She insisted upon walking to the ambulance. As paramedics checked her vital signs, she tried to convince them that she was fine. </p> <p>Then her heart stopped.</p> <p>As the ambulance sped to the hospital, paramedic Dave Sauls performed CPR. \"I kept expecting her to come out of it,\" he said, \"but it wasn't happening.\"</p> <p>At the emergency room, the nurses took over chest compressions and continued to perform CPR and AED shocks for nearly 45 minutes.</p> <p>An angiogram revealed a 100 percent blockage of her left anterior descending artery. This type of heart attack is commonly known as the widow maker. Worse yet, the blockage was caused by spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), meaning a tear in the artery wall.</p> <p>SCAD is a rare event that occurs mostly in women (about 80 percent), with an average age younger than 50. Other disorders are believed to make people more likely to suffer SCAD. One of them is a disease of the blood vessels called fibromuscular dysplasia, which Amy was later diagnosed with having. </p> <p>At her local hospital, doctors decided she needed more specialized help than they could provide.</p> <p>Amy spent nine days in a medically induced coma. Once she awoke, she saw John Paul sitting at the foot of her hospital bed. She had no idea of what had happened. </p> <p>After the sedatives and other medications left her system, Amy felt so wired she couldn't sleep a wink for two straight days (\"my eyes were like saucers,\" she said). Watching the clock tick away hour by hour, she was terrified she could experience another heart attack at any moment. Any sort of chest pain causes her anxiety to this day.</p> <p>\"Since I don't remember what it felt like, I don't have a frame of reference,\" she said. \"It's terrifying -- the inner turmoil of a cardiac patient.\"</p> <p>After 21 days in the hospital, and surviving bouts of double pneumonia and a narrowing of her trachea, Amy was released. It took more than a year for her to start feeling like herself again.</p> <p>Although her heart function is permanently compromised, she is working to build strength and stamina. In the past, Amy didn't consider it a workout unless she was drenched in sweat. But that's no longer possible. Nor are the competitive tennis matches with John Paul.</p> <p>\"It's been a hard adjustment,\" Amy said. \"I had to shift my mentality a bit. It's about how much I can get done before my heart rate hits 160 bpm.\"</p> <p>One day, Dave Sauls, the paramedic, received a Facebook message from John Paul.</p> <p>Dave had heard Amy died.

Most of these are minimally invasive, designed to improve your appearance in subtle ways without the surgery, stitches and long healing time of early facelifts, once the only rejuvenating option available.</p><p>Today's most popular procedures are:</p><ul><li>Botox injections to soften lines, with more than 7 million done annually.</li><li>Injectable fillers to plump folds, 2 million of which involve hyaluronic acid products.</li><li>Chemical peels and micro-dermabrasion, both of which resurface skin.</li><li>Laser hair removal.</li></ul><p>Keep in mind that \"minimally invasive\" doesn't always mean zero healing time. It can take weeks for the redness and crusting to disappear following strong re-surfacing procedures that remove damaged top layers of skin.

It found that opioid use increases the likelihood of A-fib by 34 percent.</p><p>\"We all know that the opioid epidemic is taking an unspeakable human toll through addiction, abuse and overdose, but our findings suggest that the toll may be even greater when we consider the cardiovascular effects opioids may have,\" said lead investigator Dr. Jonathan Stock. He's a resident at Yale New Haven Hospital in Connecticut.</p><p>The researchers said their findings are based on tracking opioid use, not abuse, and show opioids are dangerous even when the drugs are not abused or users are not addicts.</p><p>\"Our results point to the importance of prescribing opioids only as a last resort,\" Stock said. \"Opioid use, by itself, must be taken seriously and efforts should be made, not only to reduce opioid abuse and overdoses, but to ensure patients are being prescribed opioids only when absolutely necessary.\"</p><p>For the study, Stock's team analyzed medical records of more than 857,000 veterans between the ages of 25 and 51.</p><p>About 3,000 of them had been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. Of those, nearly 29 percent had used opioids, compared with 15 percent of vets without the heart irregularity.</p><p>The risk for a-fib remained even after researchers accounted for other heart disease risk factors. </p><p>Of concern was the finding that atrial fibrillation was seen in young healthy people. The average age of those in the study was 38. The abnormality is typically more common among those 65 and older.</p><p>The researchers offered a possible reason for the link between opioid use and a-fib. They theorize that opioids may lead to or worsen breathing problems during sleep as well as obstructive sleep apnea, a known risk factor for cardiac rhythm disturbances.</p><p>The findings are to be presented Nov. 10 at a meeting of the American Heart Association in Chicago. </p><p>Research presented at meetings is typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p> To learn more about atrial fibrillation, visit the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/atrial-fibrillation\" target=\"_new\"> American Heart Association</a>.</p>",

But one health expert suggests that these folks can still enjoy festive gatherings, as long as they take certain precautions.</p><p>About 5 percent of children and 4 percent of adults in the United States have a food allergy, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. The most common allergens are milk, egg, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish and shellfish.</p><p>\"It's important for people to remember that even though the main ingredients in a dish may be fine, some ingredients can be hidden and cause allergic reactions,\" said Dr. Russell Traister. He is an allergist and immunologist at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C.</p><p>People with food allergies need to be aware of cross-contamination. For example, peanut protein can remain on a bowl or work surface for up to five hours and still cause a severe reaction for someone with a peanut allergy.</p><p>In addition, people with food allergies should always have an EpiPen or the generic version of the epinephrine auto-injector with them. They should make sure it has not expired, and that friends and family members know how to use it, Traister said.</p><p>If you're attending a holiday gathering with a child or other family member who has food allergies, bring at least one dish that's safe for them in case there aren't any other options, he said.</p><p>If you're hosting a get-together, keep all prepared food packaging so guests can check the ingredients for any potential allergens.</p><p>Food allergy symptoms can range from rashes, coughing and vomiting to potentially life-threatening reactions, such as swelling of the tongue and the inability to breathe.</p><p>\"If you think you or a friend or family member is having an allergic reaction and you don't have an epinephrine auto-injector with you, call 911 immediately or go to the closest emergency department,\" Traister said in a Wake Forest news release.</p><p>\"Even if you use your epinephrine auto-injector, you should still seek medical attention to prevent a second reaction,\" he added.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians has more on <a href=\"https://familydoctor.org/condition/food-allergies/?adfree=true\" target=\"_new\">food allergies</a>.</p>",

For this study, they wanted to see if variables such as sex, breed, size or number of dogs affected the risk of asthma and allergy during a child's first year of life.</p><p>Researcher Tove Fall of Uppsala University in Sweden led the study. She's a senior lecturer in the department of medical sciences.</p><p>\"The sex of the dog can affect the amount of allergens released, and we know that uncastrated male dogs express more of a particular allergen than castrated dogs and female dogs,\" Fall said. \"Moreover, some breeds are described anecdotally as 'hypoallergenic' or 'allergy friendly' and are said to be more suitable for people with allergies, but there is no scientific evidence for this.\"</p><p>For the study, the researchers collected data on 23,600 children, born in Sweden between 2001 and 2004, who had a dog in their home for the first year of life. The investigators linked that information with two dog owner registries that classified dogs by sex, breed, number, size and claimed \"hypoallergenicity.\" </p><p>The researchers then compared the dogs' characteristics to the risk of asthma and allergies or the prescription of asthma or allergy drugs for children at age 6. They took into account known factors that could affect risk, including parental asthma and allergy, geographical location and number of siblings.</p><p>The analysis revealed that 5.4 percent of 6-year-olds had asthma. And children who had female dogs had a 16 percent lower risk than those with male dogs.</p><p>But living with a male dog did not put kids at higher risk  than having no dog at all, the findings showed. And children in families with two or more dogs had a 21 percent lower risk of asthma than those with just one.</p><p>Kids whose parents themselves have asthma or allergies more often had dogs described as \"hypoallergenic\" than did other children (12 percent versus 8 percent), according to the report. </p><p>Exposure to these breeds was tied to a 27 percent higher risk of allergy, but no increased risk for asthma.</p><p>Study co-author Catarina Almqvist Malmros is a professor in the department of medical epidemiology and biostatistics at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.</p><p>Malmros cautioned that the study findings can't prove that certain breeds cause asthma or allergies, only that there is an association. </p><p>\"The likely explanation for this higher risk is that families with a history of allergy to furred pets more often choose these dogs, and also that 'allergy-friendly' dogs do not in fact release less allergens,\" she said in a university news release. </p><p>The report was published online Nov. 15 in the journal <i>Scientific Reports</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>To learn more about asthma, visit the <a href=\"https://www.aaaai.org/conditions-and-treatments/asthma\" target=\"_new\"> American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 16, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- When you have serious food allergies, eating at a restaurant can literally mean risking your life. But new research suggests you can take steps to protect yourself when dining out.</p><p>In fact, the more steps you take to protect yourself from exposure to the allergic substance, the less likely you are to have an allergic reaction, the study found.</p><p>The researchers asked 39 people with allergies (or their parents) about 25 behaviors people might do before eating out. Nineteen of those surveyed had experienced a food allergy reaction while dining at a restaurant.</p><p>\"Overall, when you look at the results and the strategies that people used, people who had an allergic reaction [after eating out] used significantly less strategies compared to non-reactors. Non-reactors used an average of 15 strategies, reactors used an average of six,\" said study author Dr. Justine Ade, a pediatric resident at University Hospitals' Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland.</p><p>Up to 15 million people may have food allergies, according to the nonprofit organization FARE (Food Allergy and Research Education). Although 170 foods have been reported to cause allergic reactions, there are eight common foods that cause allergies in the United States: milk, egg, peanut, tree nuts, wheat, soy, fish and shellfish. FARE reports that sesame allergy is also a growing threat. </p><p>Eating food outside the home has been linked to numerous deaths in people with food allergies, according to the researchers. </p><p>Although the study didn't evaluate how well any particular strategy worked, it did note how often people used individual strategies. </p><p>The top five strategies people used included: </p><ul><li>Speaking to the waiter on arrival (80 percent),</li><li>Ordering food with simple ingredients (77 percent), </li><li>Double-checking food before eating (77 percent), </li><li>Avoiding restaurants with higher likelihood of contamination (74 percent),</li><li>Reviewing ingredients on a restaurant website (72 percent).</li></ul><p>The strategies used least often included:</p><ul><li>Placing food allergy order separately (23 percent), </li><li>Using a personal allergy card (26 percent),</li><li>No longer eating at restaurants (39 percent), </li><li>Choosing a chain restaurant (41 percent),</li><li>Going to a restaurant during off-peak hours (44 percent).</li></ul><p>Ade said it may sound like a lot of work just to eat out, but \"these are things that become second nature for some people, and it probably takes less than five minutes to do most of these things.\"</p><p>People with food allergies aren't the only ones who worry about what's on their restaurant plate. Alice Bast, CEO of Beyond Celiac, a nonprofit health and awareness group, said that every time someone with celiac disease eats out, they play \"gluten roulette.\" </p><p>Celiac disease is a digestive disorder, and symptoms are triggered when someone with the disease eats gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. </p><p>\"Dining out is one of the biggest challenges of living with celiac disease,\" Bast said. \"When you're out of control of your food, it's easy to feel anxious about the possibility of becoming sick. There are always risks when someone else is preparing your meal, especially if they don't take it seriously, or if they are just unaware of how to take the appropriate precautions.\" </p><p>Both experts said it's important to be vigilant and take the steps that you can to make sure your food is as safe as it can be. In the case of food allergies, Ade said it's important to carry an epinephrine injection pen every time you eat out. </p><p>Ade will present the findings on Friday at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology annual meeting, in Seattle. Research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>FARE (Food Allergy and Research Education) offers more about <a href=\"https://www.foodallergy.org/life-with-food-allergies/managing-lifes-milestones/dining-out\" target=\"_new\">dining out with food allergies</a>.</p>",

For example, a 5-foot 4-inch person weighing 175 pounds has a BMI of 30.</p><p>The risk of dying young was also higher for \"very\" obese people -- those with a BMI of 35 to 39.  People in this weight category had nearly double the odds of dying during the 24-year study period compared to people with a normal weight, said biostatistician Ching-Ti Liu and colleagues.</p><p>The study was unique, Liu's team believes, because it wasn't based on a person's BMI at one point in the life span, but instead tracked people's \"weight history\" over time. That should \"improve the accuracy of BMI data and thus lead to better estimates of the association between obesity and mortality,\" the study authors reported.</p><p>The approach did turn up one finding that may be heartening to people fighting the \"battle of the bulge\": Being overweight, but not past the BMI 30 threshold for obesity, did not seem to affect life span.</p><p>The study found that overweight people could expect roughly the same survival odds as those in the normal-weight category.</p><p>\"There was no difference in mortality risk for those who remained overweight and those who remained normal weight,\" noted Mark Pereira, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota. That could be because healthy lifestyle changes can stave off disease, even in overweight people, he suggested in a commentary accompanying the new study.</p><p>Prior studies \"have clearly shown that decreases in disease incidence are possible through improved diet and physical activity among overweight and obese individuals, whether weight loss is achieved or not,\" he added.</p><p>The Boston University study relied on detailed information collected every few years on the weight of nearly 6,200 adult participants in the ongoing Framingham Heart Study, with records stretching back over 24 years.</p><p>Overall, more than half (56 percent) of the study group had died by the end of 2014. Being obese or very obese seemed to have a significant impact on whether death arrived relatively early, Liu's team found.</p><p>Because smoking could confound the results, his team also ran the numbers  for only those 3,075 participants who had never smoked.</p>  <p>The trends appeared to be even stronger in the absence of smoking, the findings showed.</p><p>In this group, being obese was tied to 31 percent higher odds of death during the study period, while being very obese bumped up the risk to nearly 2.4 times that of normal-weight never-smokers.</p> <p>Surprisingly, in the \"never-smokers\" group, being overweight (but not obese)  <i>did</i> seem to have an effect in lowering life span, relative to normal-weight people.</p><p>Overall, all of these effects seemed more profound in men than in women, the researchers said.</p><p>There was one more intriguing finding:  The impact  obesity has on survival seems to have eased over the past few decades.</p><p>According to the Liu's team, that may be due to better \"risk factor control\" -- healthy lifestyle changes -- or improvements in drug therapy (statins, for example), surgeries such as angioplasties or bypass, and hospital care.</p><p>All of those advances may be keeping obese Americans alive longer than in decades past, the researchers said.</p><p>Still, Pereira wrote, \"the bottom line from these analyses was that the lowest mortality risk was observed among individuals who remained in the normal weight or overweight categories over time,\" and never became obese.</p><p>Doing so may be becoming tougher, he added, since \"to be overweight or mildly obese today, relative to four or more decades ago, appears to be the new normal.\"</p><p>That doesn't mean obese Americans are helpless to improve their health, however. According to Pereira, the study supports \"lifestyle and environment changes to prevent chronic diseases and mortality among overweight and obese individuals.\"</p><p>The study was published online Nov. 16 in <i>JAMA Network Open</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on maintaining a healthy weight at the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/losing-weight\" target=\"_new\">American Heart Association</a>.</p>",

He is a nutrition researcher at  Harvard School of Public Health in Boston.</p><p>The new study was published Nov. 21 in the <i>BMJ</i>.</p><p>The researchers noted that previous studies have shown smoking, a poor diet, inactivity, and being overweight/obese increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. Shift work has also been linked with an increased risk, the investigators added in a journal news release.</p><p>But the authors said  they believe this is the first study to examine the combined effect of an unhealthy lifestyle and shift work on type 2 diabetes risk. The results show it's especially important for shift workers to follow a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>The researchers analyzed data from more than 143,000 U.S. women who did not have type 2 diabetes, heart disease or cancer when they enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and NHS II in 1976 and 1989.</p><p>Over 22 to 24 years of follow-up, nearly 11,000 of the women were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. For every five years of working rotating night shifts, there was a 31 percent higher risk of a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. </p><p>Each unhealthy lifestyle factor -- ever smoking, being overweight or obese, having a poor diet, being inactive -- was linked with a 2.3 times higher risk of being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The study authors explained that a poor diet was low in fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains, and high in processed meat, trans fats, sugar and salt.</p><p>Women who had any of the four unhealthy lifestyle factors and also worked rotating night shifts had the highest risk of developing type 2 diabetes, the findings showed. Among this group, each individual unhealthy lifestyle factor was associated with a 2.8 times increased risk.</p><p>This suggests that some kind of interaction between rotating night shifts and an unhealthy lifestyle factor adds further risk, according to the authors. In this study, rotating night shifts were defined as working at least three night shifts a month, in addition to day and evening shifts that month.</p><p>The researchers concluded that rotating night-shift work accounted for about 17 percent of the combined higher risk of type 2 diabetes, unhealthy lifestyle accounted for about 71 percent, and the remaining 11 percent was additional risk associated with the interaction of the two.</p><p>According to the report, the increased risk of type 2 diabetes among rotating night-shift workers with an unhealthy lifestyle may be due to disrupted sleep and body-clock rhythms affecting hormones, other metabolic pathways or the balance of bacteria in the gut.</p><p>Because this was an observational study, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. Also, since all of the nurses were female and mostly white, the findings may not apply to men and other racial or ethnic groups, the researchers noted.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases has more on <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/preventing-type-2-diabetes\" target=\"_new\">type 2 diabetes prevention</a>.</p>",

In addition, addicted women may not tell their doctors about their drug use for fear of the legal consequences, Admon noted.</p><p>Another women's health expert agreed with the findings.</p><p>\"This study confirms what I have been hearing clinically from providers and patients in the West that there is an unrecognized problem with amphetamines, and that the opioid crisis is now coupled with an amphetamine crisis that desperately needs monetary, treatment and recovery infrastructure support to reduce it,\" said Hendree Jones, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.</p><p>Furthermore, the study provides compelling data that underscores the lack of addiction treatment resources for women of childbearing age, said Jones, who wasn't involved with the research.</p><p>For the study, Admon and colleagues collected data on 47 million births in U.S. hospitals over 12 years. </p><p>They found that the number of births among women addicted to amphetamine, mostly methamphetamine, doubled from 2008 to 2015, from 1.2 per 1,000 births to 2.4 per 1,000 births.</p><p>In addition, opioid use more than quadrupled from 1.5 per 1,000 births between 2004 and 2005 to 6.5 per 1,000 between 2014 and 2015.  </p><p>Using amphetamine during pregnancy increases the odds of moms dying or having serious medical complications by nearly two times of that of women using opioids, the researchers found. </p><p>Also the risk of preterm delivery, preeclampsia or eclampsia, heart failure or heart attack, and the need for a blood transfusion were higher among moms using amphetamine, compared with those using opioids, according to the study. </p><p>The main risk to infants born to addicted mothers is neonatal abstinence syndrome. Basically, the infants are born addicted to the drug mom was using and they go through withdrawal, much as an adult does when they stop taking the drug.</p><p>Symptoms such as body shakes, tremors, breathing problems, diarrhea or throwing up and fever and sweating can last up to six months, according to the March of Dimes. </p><p>Often these babies need to be in neonatal intensive care units for an extended period.</p><p>Between 2014 and 2015, amphetamine use caused delivery complications in roughly 1 percent of all births in the rural West (11 per 1,000 deliveries), which was higher than the number of complications among women using opioids in most areas. </p><p>Opioid use during pregnancy was highest in rural areas of the Northeast, causing complications in nearly 3 percent of all births (29 per 1,000 deliveries).</p><p>Poor, white women on public assistance were the ones most likely to be using amphetamine and opioids, the researchers found.</p><p>In addition to using amphetamine and opioids,  many of these women are also using marijuana and tobacco, said Dr. Rahul Gupta, chief medical and health officer at the March of Dimes.</p><p>\"It's very troubling that of all the times in the lifecycle of an individual during pregnancy, women who are using opioids are also using tobacco,\" he said. \"That almost seals the fate of the infant, as well as the health of the mother and the ability of the mother to take care of the child,\" Gupta said.</p><p>The report was published Nov. 29 in the <i>American Journal of Public Health</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Pregnancy Association has more information on <a href=\"http://americanpregnancy.org/pregnancy-health/illegal-drugs-during-pregnancy/\" target=\"_new\">drug addiction and pregnancy</a>.</p>",

The women's average age was 37. The group included 23 women from the United Kingdom, seven from the United States, and one from Norway. </p><p>The most common reason for egg freezing was not having a partner or having a partner who wouldn't commit to fatherhood, the findings showed.</p><p>Some of the women said they wanted to relieve the pressure of trying to find a suitable partner. Many said they hoped never to have to use their frozen eggs because they would conceive naturally with a future partner. Several said that freezing their eggs was emotionally difficult because they wanted to become mothers with a committed partner.</p><p>The researchers also found that the information available to women considering freezing their eggs was inadequate.

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Dec. 19, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Dangerous infections, blinding ulcers in the eyes: These are just some of the troubles that can come from wearing your contacts for too long.</p><p>Contact lenses are generally considered safe, but wearing them while asleep significantly raises the risk of developing serious  complications that can cause permanent visual loss, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns.</p><p>In one instance, a 34-year-old man who both swam while wearing his contact lenses and wore them overnight three to four days a week developed a rare but potentially blinding form of keratitis caused by a microscopic organism.</p><p> Keratitis -- an inflammation of the cornea -- is responsible for an estimated one million outpatient and emergency department visits each year, according to the CDC.</p><p>Another case involved a teenage girl who developed a corneal ulcer and scarring after wearing unprescribed lenses to bed.</p><p>Yet another involved a 57-year-old man who nearly lost vision in one eye after wearing his soft lenses nonstop for two weeks without daily cleaning.</p><p>In that case, the patient ultimately required a corneal transplant in his right eye after suffering a bacterial infection and a perforated cornea.</p><p>\"The excess risks of developing corneal infection with overnight wear of contact lenses has been recognized for many years,\" explained Dr. Oliver Schein. He is a professor of ophthalmology, and vice-chair for quality and safety with the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Schein was not involved in the current case study report.</p><p>With an eye toward the 45 million Americans who regularly wear contacts, the CDC is highlighting the concern in collaboration with the Eye and Contact Lens Association and the disease surveillance network EMERGEncy ID NET.</p><p>Together, the organizations published a new report in the January issue of the <i>Annals of Emergency Medicine</i> that outlines the experiences of six patients who recently developed corneal infections after routinely wearing their contact lenses to bed. The report was led by Dr. Jon Femling of the University of New Mexico's School of Medicine.</p><p>Despite the introduction of silicone hydrogels in the 1990s, overall corneal infection risk has held steady over decades, Schein said, affecting about one in every 2,500 lens wearers.</p><p>But that risk is \"at least 10-fold greater for those choosing to sleep with lenses in. So I discourage that practice whenever I can,\" he added.</p><p>As to why the risk is greater, Schein cited a number of factors that \"favor microbial [germ] growth\" whenever the eyes are closed, including \"microtrauma to the surface of the cornea,\" a drop in tear production, and a rise in temperature and humidity.</p><p>Amy Watts, director of optometry and contact lens service, and director of the vision rehabilitation service at Massachusetts Eye and Ear in Boston, said corneal function also plays a role.</p><p>\"Our cornea is the only part of the body that receives its oxygen from the atmosphere and not our blood supply,\" she noted. </p><p>So, \"when we close our eyes at night, we reduce the amount of oxygen to our cornea by cutting the corneas off from the oxygen-rich atmosphere,\" Watts explained.</p><p>\"Wearing a contact lens further reduces the oxygen while asleep, and may put us just past the tipping point for keeping our corneas in optimal condition to fight off microbes,\" she said.</p><p>Another issue is that people who sleep with their lenses also tend to shower with them in place. And \"tap water -- just like water in lakes, pools, ponds, oceans -- can have microbes that may cause a serious eye infection,\" Watts said. \"In extreme cases, these infections can cause a severe loss in vision.\"</p><p>Both Watts and Schein said preventing corneal infection is best achieved by wearing single-day disposable lenses.</p><p> Schein said, \"This approach also removes the need for solution use and, most importantly, obviates the need for a contact lens case, an important advantage, since contamination of the case is certainly a risk factor for infection. However, if the user tries to save money by not discarding the lens daily, then the safety advantage is entirely lost.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, he advises any wearer who develops a painful red eye to remove their lenses and see an eye care specialist within 24 hours.</p><p>\"Most emergency rooms are not equipped with eye specialists or the equipment -- [such as a] slit lamp biomicroscope -- necessary to distinguish a simple abrasion from an infection,\" Schein cautioned. \"Therefore, those who go to emergency departments initially should be seen in follow up as soon as possible by an eye care professional.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has more on <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm048893.htm\" target=\"_new\">contact lens safety</a>.</p>",

Two staff members conducted detailed analyses to verify the ethnicity of each person who died of a drug overdose between 2013 and 2015.</p><p>The study found steep increases in opioid overdose death rates among Native Americans. Young males ages 25-54 were hit hardest. In fact, young Native American men had more than double the odds of dying of an opioid OD than their similarly aged white peers, the study showed.</p><p>Why the big disparity? Joshi and her colleagues believe societal issues may play a role.</p><p>American Indians and Alaska Natives \"experience high rates of physical, emotional, and historical trauma and significant socioeconomic disparities, which might contribute to higher rates of drug use in these communities,\" they wrote.</p><p>They added that Indian Health Services has also suffered from \"longstanding underfunding,\" so Native Americans continue to \"face barriers to receiving quality medical and behavioral health care.\"</p><p>Another physician working in the field called the Washington state findings \"chilling.\"</p><p>They \"reveal an alarming trend with the American Indian/Alaska Native community,\" said Dr. Harshal Kirane. He directs addiction services at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City.</p><p>Kirane called for urgent action to \"mobilize adequate support for this community.\"</p><p>Glatter said so-called \"medication-assisted treatment\" (MAT) programs, which help addicts reduce and then quit opioids, are key.</p><p>These interventions are an \"evidence-based and validated approach to treating those affected, while also reducing the risk of relapse,\" he explained. Also helpful: dispensing OD-antidote naloxone kits to help save lives.</p><p>Joshi's group agreed, noting that the Indian Health Service is already forging partnerships with tribal governments and regional Indian health boards. Together, they are boosting access to \"medication-assisted treatment and naloxone for first responders,\" the researchers said.</p><p>The new findings were published in the Dec. 21 <i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</i>, a journal of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on  <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/statedeaths.html\" target=\"_new\">overdose deaths</a>.</p>",

Instead,  \"diabetes and cancer share certain risk factors that might contribute to these associations, including obesity, smoking and diet,\" she explained in a meeting news release.</p><p>When the investigators looked at the results over a 10-year period, they found there was a 38 percent greater increase in new cases of pancreatic cancer and a 30 percent greater increase in lung cancer incidence among people with type 2 diabetes than among those without the blood sugar disease.</p><p>The researchers also found that among patients with type 2 diabetes, death rates were 29 percent higher for prostate cancer, 25 percent higher for breast cancer and 9 percent higher for colon cancer, when compared with people without diabetes.</p><p>\"With the number of people with type 2 diabetes doubling over the past 30 years, our findings underscore the importance of improving diabetes care,\" Bjornsdottir said.</p><p>Now, with diabetes tied to cancer risk, \"the importance of a healthy lifestyle is clearer than ever,\" she added.</p><p>More than 415 million people worldwide have diabetes -- about one in 11 adults -- and the number is expected to rise to 642 million by 2040, the study authors noted.</p><p>Research presented at medical meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians has more on <a href=\"https://familydoctor.org/condition/diabetes/?adfree=true\" target=\"_new\">diabetes</a>.</p>",

Half had recently lost a spouse, while the other half were married or single.</p><p>Researchers found that the association between sleep disturbances and inflammation was two to three times higher in the grieving spouses, according to the study published recently in the journal <i>Psychosomatic Medicine</i>.</p><p>\"The death of a spouse is an acutely stressful event, and they have to adapt to living without the support of the spouse,\" Chirinos said. \"Add sleep disturbance to their already stressful situation, and you double the stressor. As a result, their immune system is more overactivated.\"</p><p>Grieving spouses are at increased risk of developing heart disease or dying within a year of their partner's death, the researchers noted.</p><p>\"We already knew bereaved people had higher inflammation and a higher risk for heart disease and dying within a year of the spouse's death,\" Chirinos said. \"But what was causing it? Was it the grief or sadness itself, loneliness or sleep? Now we know it's not the grief itself; it is the sleep disturbance that arises from that grief.\"</p><p>The main sleep problem associated with an overactivated immune system was poor sleep efficiency, which can include insomnia, early waking or difficulty falling asleep.</p><p>For bereaved people, the study highlights the importance of treating sleep problems, Chirinos said, adding that doctors need to ask patients about their sleep after a spouse dies. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Mental Health America has more on <a href=\"http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/conditions/coping-loss-bereavement-and-grief\" target=\"_new\">bereavement and grief</a>.</p>",

Now,  generics maker Mylan Pharmaceuticals is adding more products to the list.</p><p>The recall involves 104 lots of three medicines:  valsartan tablets; combination tablets with the drugs valsartan and amlodipine; and combination tablets with valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide.</p><p>The reason for the move is similar to that cited in prior valsartan recalls: Mylan said it had detected trace amounts of a probable cancer-causing chemical called N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) in valsartan meds.</p><p>NDEA is found in certain foods, drinking water, air pollution and industrial processes.</p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is currently trying to trace the source of the contaminants, originally linked to factories in China and India that help supply valsartan to generic drug makers. Those factories were linked to contamination with a second type of potential carcinogen, called N-nitrosodimethylamine, or NDMA.</p><p>Valsartan is used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and to reduce the risk of death after a heart attack. Valsartan in combination with amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide is used to treat high blood pressure.</p><p>The expanded recall includes: 26 lots of amlodipine and valsartan tablets, USP (5 mg/160 mg; 10 mg/160 mg; 5 mg/320 mg; and 10 mg/320 mg); 51 lots of valsartan tablets, USP (40 mg, 80 mg, 160 mg and 320 mg); and 27 lots of valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, USP (80 mg/12.5 mg; 160 mg/12.5 mg; 160 mg/25 mg; 320 mg/12.5 mg; and 320 mg/25 mg).</p><p>The drugs were distributed in the United States between March 2017 and November 2018.</p><p>For the FDA's full detailed list of all the recalled valsartan products, look <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/UCM615703.pdfutm_campaign=FDA%20updates%20on%20angiotensin%20II%20receptor%20blocker%20%28ARB%29%20recalls%3A%20Mylan%20expands&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Eloqua\" target=\"_new\">here</a>.</p> <p>Speaking with <i>USA Today</i>, the FDA's Janet Woodcock said that \"we still don't understand the complete root cause of this problem. We understand part of it. We don't understand all of the steps that led to this.\"</p><p>Woodcock directs the agency's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. She said the factories implicated in the recall have been placed on \"import alert,\" meaning that drugs manufactured by these plants cannot enter the United States.</p><p>In addition, all \"sartan\" medicines are being tested to be sure they don't contain the contaminants, Woodcock said.  So far, the carcinogens have not turned up in Diovan, the brand-name version of valsartan made by Novartis, she noted.</p><p>\"I would think these recalls would start dropping off now,\" Woodcock told <i>USA Today</i>. \"We've had this import alert in place for quite a long time, and the companies buying from these sources were told to check and recall.\"</p><p>In the meantime, Mylan said that patients who are taking valsartan should continue to do so, because the risk to their health may be higher if they stop taking it immediately without any alternative treatment.</p><p>Instead, patients should talk to their pharmacist or physician about an alternative treatment, and should contact their healthcare provider if they've experienced any problems that may be related to the recalled valsartan products, the company advised.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart Association has more on <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure/types-of-blood-pressure-medications#.W1CmjdhKh0s\" target=\"_new\">high blood pressure medications</a>.</p>",

A study done by researchers at Penn State University found out just how early that learning should start -- by age 2.</p><p>For this study, parents filled out surveys about how many words their 2-year-olds knew, and then the researchers checked in with them three years later when their children were in kindergarten. The toddlers with a large vocabulary were more likely to start kindergarten ready to read and learn math. It turned out that they also paid more attention in class and were better behaved. This may also be why some kids do better than others in school.</p><p>Building that vocabulary stems from very early and frequent interactions with mom and dad. It takes only simple things to engage baby, such as talking and reading. In fact, it's hard to overstress the importance of reading to babies. A separate study done at the University of Iowa found that babies respond more to reading than to even toy- or puppet-play and, in turn, learn more from it.</p><p>A very young baby may only babble in response to hearing your voice as you read, but when you respond back by repeating or expanding on his or her sound or offering a word with that sound, this back-and-forth interaction helps with language development.</p><p>Another important difference maker for a child's early development is to read books with bright pictures and simple sentences rather than single words. Be engaged as you to read so that baby will develop not only a great vocabulary, but also a love for books that will serve him or her well throughout life.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The organization Reading Rockets has great tips on <a href=\" http://www.readingrockets.org/article/reading-tips-parents-babies\" target=\"_new\">reading to babies</a>.</p>",

But there are safety precautions to take when you leave a protected indoor environment.</p><p>The Road Runners Club of America has a wealth of advice.</p><p>For starters, take some precautions before you leave home. First, tell loved ones where you'll be running. Next, in addition to taking ID with you, write your name, phone number and blood type (in case of an accident) inside one of your running shoes. Also, carry your cellphone.</p><p>\"There's safety in numbers\" is an old expression that still holds true. Steer clear of unpopulated areas, deserted or unlit streets, even overgrown trails. Trust your intuition -- if a situation just doesn't feel right, stay away from it. Also get in the habit of varying your running pattern, but do run in familiar areas.</p><p>While it's easy to lose yourself in your thoughts or music, stay alert. That means skipping the headphones. You want both your eyes and ears attuned to your environment.</p><p>Whether you run on city streets or country roads, go against the flow of traffic so you can see oncoming vehicles and they can see you. This should allow you to react more quickly to a problem.</p><p>Remember mom's lessons about crossing streets -- look both ways at all intersections. Do obey traffic signals, and don't blindly assume that drivers will see you or that they'll stop for you, especially those turning into your path.</p><p>If you want to go running while traveling, ask the local running club or running store for safe routes. Stick to areas with open businesses in case of an emergency and, of course, follow all the safety steps you would at home.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more <a href=\"https://www.rrca.org/education/rrca-general-running-safety-tips\" target=\"_new\">safety tips</a> check out the website of the Road Runners Club of America.</p>",

They then tracked weight gain in the babies to age 3 years.</p><p>Antibiotics and antimicrobial agents can alter any person's gut makeup (microbiome) by killing off certain species of bacteria, which allows room for others to blossom.</p><p>The most notorious example is <i>Clostridium difficile</i>, a bacteria that can flourish from overuse of antibiotics and lead to life-threatening diarrhea.</p><p>According to Kozyrskyj, \"Disinfectant products used very often, weekly or greater, did cause changes to the infants' gut bacteria. It caused some bacteria to decline and others to increase.\" </p><p>Specifically, antibacterial cleaners were linked to an increase in gut levels of <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> in infants.</p><p><i>Lachnospiraceae</i> bacteria should not be heavily present in the guts of babies who are not yet on solid food, explained Gail Cresci, an expert in pediatric gastroenterology with the Cleveland Clinic.</p><p>These bacteria typically are \"good\" bacteria that feed on tough-to-digest carbohydrate fibers, contributing extra energy to the body, Cresci said.</p><p>\"You don't start to see them until the diet has been advanced to solids, around the age of 2 or 3,\" she added.</p><p>Having an abundance of <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> bacteria from an early age could cause growing kids to be bombarded with additional calories, Cresci said.</p><p>\"It could make sense that if there is an increase of these bacteria early, at 3 months, it could then allow the microbiome to harvest more energy and at that age, it would be stored as fat,\" Cresci explained. \"That could potentially contribute to obesity later.\"</p><p>Infants living in homes with the highest use of disinfectants were twice as likely to have a gut microbiome enriched with <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, the researchers reported.</p><p>Higher <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> levels were associated with higher BMI scores at ages 1 and 3, according to the report.</p><p> Kozyrskyj said that the researchers  \"found that those <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> elevated with disinfectant use were likely responsible for this overweight development. They were in the pathway.\"</p><p>Infants were more likely to have normal weight when eco-friendly cleaners were used daily. These cleaners are either homemade or store-bought cleaners that use natural ingredients such as vinegar, peroxide, baking soda, citric acid or essential oils, Kozyrskyj noted.</p><p>Although the findings are interesting, you can't draw a clear cause-and-effect relationship from this study, said Dr. Sheela Magge, director of pediatric endocrinology at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore.</p><p>\"I would agree there's biologic plausibility, but we obviously need more work to establish what's the cause and what's the effect,\" Magge said. \"It's always difficult to really establish that one particular thing, in this case these household cleaners, causes increased weight gain.\"</p><p>The study, which was funded in part by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, was published Sept. 17 in the <i>CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal)</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Cleaning Institute has more about <a href=\"https://www.cleaninginstitute.org/clean_living_at_home/\" target=\"_new\">household cleaners</a>.</p>",

These bats, which are common in Latin America, can spread <i>Bartonella</i> bacteria to people and livestock, the researchers explained.</p><p>During a two-year period, the investigators collected blood, saliva and fecal samples from vampire bats across Belize and Peru, to assess the prevalence of <i>Bartonella</i>  infection. The bats that tested positive for the bacteria underwent additional genetic testing, to help the researchers determine how the bacteria is spread.</p><p>The study, led by Daniel Becker at Montana State, found that 67 percent of the bats tested carried <i>Bartonella</i> bacteria. Large males had the highest risk of being infected. The researchers also found that <i>Bartonella</i>  genotypes are distributed widely across Central and South America -- and not clustered geographically. </p><p><i>Bartonella</i> is often spread through bites, but the bats' saliva and fecal samples were also positive for the infection, suggesting the bacteria can spread through environmental contamination.</p><p>The findings were published Sept. 27 in the journal <i>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</i>.</p><p>But the researchers noted that more studies are needed to explore how <i>Bartonella</i> spreads from bats to people.</p><p>\"Given the high rates of vampire bat bites and proximity to humans and domestic animals, such efforts to verify the possibility and frequency of oral and environmental exposures\" would help scientists nail down how common transmission of <i>Bartonella</i> between species is, the study authors said in a journal news release.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. Geological Survey has more about <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/are-bats-dangerous?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products\" target=\"_new\"> vampire bats</a>.</p>",

When these arteries and the heart are diseased there is abnormal blood flow to all the organs but the lower extremities can be affected most because of how long that artery is.\"</p><p>When circulation issues to the leg and foot become severe, amputation is often the only option.</p> <p>How much might particular diabetes medicines affect the odds of needing an amputation?</p><p>To help find out, Potier's team tracked outcomes for nearly 1,500 people with type 2 diabetes. The study specifically focused on amputations, as well as procedures such as angioplasty or the bypassing of blocked or damaged blood vessels. Those procedures are used to improve circulation and prevent leg or foot amputations.</p><p>Participants were followed until they had a leg procedure or died. Nearly 700 of the study participants were taking a diuretic drug.</p><p>Over a follow-up of about seven years, 13 percent of those taking a diuretic had an amputation or other procedure on their lower leg, compared with just 7 percent of those not taking a diuretic.</p><p>Said another way, this meant that taking a diuretic increased the risk of having an amputation or an angioplasty/bypass by 75 percent or more, compared with those not using one.</p><p>Most of this increase involved amputations, which nearly doubled for those taking a diuretic.</p><p>The results of the study were presented Monday at the meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, in Berlin. </p><p>It's important to note the study was observational in nature, meaning that while it could point to an association between diuretics and amputation rates, it could not prove cause and effect, and other factors might be at play. Furthermore, research presented at medical meetings is typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>According to Bernstein, the take-home message here is not to immediately discontinue the use of diuretics, but to keep in mind that \"the patient and physician must be very careful not to overtreat and be very selective\" in which drugs are used to fight diabetes.</p><p>Diabetes specialist Dr. Robert Courgi agreed. Reviewing the findings, he said that while more study is needed to confirm the results, \"if a patient is at risk for amputation then perhaps diuretics should be avoided for other equally effective options.\" Courgi is an endocrinologist at Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on type 2 diabetes, visit the <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/type-2/\" target=\"_new\"> American Diabetes Association</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY,  Oct. 4, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Vitamin D supplements have long been touted as a way to improve bone health and possibly ward off the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis in older adults.</p><p>But a new study contends that claims of benefits from supplements  of the \"sunshine vitamin\" fall flat.</p><p>A review of  previously published studies found that taking either high or low doses of vitamin D supplements didn't prevent fractures or falls, or improve bone density.</p><p>Vitamin D is found in very few foods. One of the biggest sources of the vitamin is exposure to sunlight.</p><p>\"Vitamin D supplement use is common, particularly in North America,\" where up to 40 percent of older people take them, said lead researcher Dr. Alison Avenell. She is clinical chair in health services research at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.</p><p>\"Most adults don't need to take vitamin D supplements, although they are unlikely to do harm if taken in low doses,\" she added.</p><p>Vitamin D supplements do prevent rare conditions, such as rickets in children and osteomalacia (softening of bones) in adults. People at risk of vitamin D deficiency include those with little or no sun exposure, such as nursing home residents who are indoors all the time, or those who always cover their skin when outside, Avenell said.</p><p>There's also existing evidence that vitamin D helps prevent cancer or heart disease, she added. </p><p>\"Preserving bone strength involves keeping active, not smoking, not being too thin, and taking medications for osteoporosis,\" Avenell said.</p><p>Based on the new findings, Avenell thinks guidelines that recommend vitamin D supplements for bone health should be changed. </p><p>For the new report, Avenell and her colleagues reviewed 81 studies, most of which dealt with vitamin D alone, not in combination with the mineral calcium. </p><p>\"Calcium supplements on their own have minimal effect on bone mineral density and fracture, and may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease,\" Avenell said. </p><p>The only evidence that calcium and vitamin D together prevent fractures comes from a trial of older people with very low vitamin D levels in nursing homes. But calcium and vitamin D may also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, Avenell said. </p><p>In addition, most of the studies covered in the new review included women aged 65 and older who took more than 800 IUs (international units) of vitamin D daily.</p><p>The new study found no meaningful effect of vitamin D supplementation when it came to reducing any fracture, hip fractures or falls. </p><p>This type of study, called a meta-analysis, tries to find common elements among previously published studies. This kind or research, however, is limited by differences in the methods and conclusions of the different studies analyzed by researchers, so the findings may not be consistent across the board. </p><p>A group that represents the supplement industry took issue with the findings.</p><p>\"There is evidence that vitamin D is very helpful, especially when you have low levels,\" said Duffy MacKay, senior vice president for scientific and regulatory affairs at the Council for Responsible Nutrition.</p><p>Over 94 percent of the U.S. population has vitamin D levels that are too low, he said. \"Most Americans do not get enough vitamin D to meet their needs and supplements can fill that gap, but if your vitamin D levels are sufficient you don't need to supplement.\"</p><p>The benefit of proper vitamin D levels are seen over a lifetime and can't be judged in short-term studies that look at any specific benefit, he added.</p> <p>Dr. Minisha Sood, an endocrinologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said this new study should convince doctors that vitamin D supplements don't have a role in maintaining healthy bones, but they do have other benefits.</p><p>Previous research suggests that vitamin D, when taken in tandem with calcium, may help prevent certain cancers and protect against age-related  declines in thinking and memory.</p><p>\"What is important to keep in mind is that those with low vitamin D were not represented in this meta-analysis, and vitamin D supplementation -- repletion, actually -- is still necessary for those with low vitamin D levels, regardless of age,\" Sood said.</p><p>The findings were published online Oct. 4 in <i>The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on vitamin D, visit the <a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institutes of Health</a>.</p>",

So he didn't give much thought to the heart valve that surgeons replaced at the same time.</p> <p>\"I figured everything was fixed and didn't need to worry about it,\" Broussard said of the 2011 procedures. </p> <p>A few months later, Broussard had a stroke caused by a clot that doctors suspect developed after his surgery. He spent the next 11 months relearning how to read, write and speak. He worked through other health challenges, including renal failure that caused him to lose a kidney.</p> <p>So when Broussard, who lives in St. Augustine, Fla., started having trouble breathing in July 2017, he never imagined it could be from a problem with his heart valve.</p> <p>Affecting about 2.5 percent of Americans, heart valve disease occurs when one or more of the heart valves have been damaged, disrupting blood flow by not opening or closing properly. Valve disease becomes more common with age, affecting about 13 percent of adults age 75 and older. </p> <p>Yet awareness of heart valve problems is relatively low, in part because symptoms -- which include shortness of breath and fatigue -- aren't specific and may develop so slowly that they go unnoticed, said cardiologist Dr. Vuyisile T. Nkomo, director of the Valvular Heart Disease Clinic at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.</p> <p>\"We often miss the window to offer lifesaving therapies because the condition is so severe it makes intervening too risky,\" Nkomo said.</p> <p>Valve disease is often overlooked by health providers, especially in patients with competing conditions, making it underdiagnosed, Nkomo said. Patients, he said, should be aware of their risk factors and advocate for themselves. In addition to older age, risk factors for valve problems include previous heart valve issues, heart attack and heart failure.</p> <p>When Broussard first noticed his symptoms, he thought it was a bad cold or the flu. But as the symptoms worsened, he made two visits to a clinic before going to the emergency room.</p> <p>\"I had to sleep sitting up because I felt like I was drowning,\" he said. </p> <p>Testing showed fluid in his lungs, and his heart was straining. More tests showed the tissue-based aortic valve that had been placed six years earlier had failed. </p> <p>Within a week, Broussard underwent a transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or TAVR, a minimally invasive surgical procedure that wedges a replacement valve into the aortic valve's place through a catheter, similar to a stent placement.</p> <p>The diagnosis took Broussard by surprise. After brushing off his first valve replacement, this time he was determined to learn all he could, including about how to control risk factors. </p> <p>Broussard, now 66, exercises regularly, keeps his weight down and watches his diet. He also learned that his family history of heart disease -- his dad died from a heart attack at age 49  may have increased his risk.</p> <p>\"I wish I'd been told when my dad died that I could have heart disease and watched more closely,\" said Broussard, who now works to educate others as a Heart Valve Ambassador for the American Heart Association.</p> <p>Even after his first heart valve surgery, Broussard said he didn't realize that he'd need to watch for symptoms over the years. </p> <p>\"Patients play an important role,\" he said. \"Being vigilant and keeping track of your body and sharing any changes with your doctor is important.\"</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY,  Oct. 25, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Anxiety, depression and panic attacks are sending U.S. college students to mental health clinics in record numbers, a new study finds.</p><p>Between 2009 and 2015, treatment and diagnoses of anxiety increased by nearly 6 percent among these students, followed by depression and panic attacks, which each increased about 3 percent. Anxiety is the most common problem, affecting almost 15 percent of college students across the United States, the researchers reported.</p><p>\"Mental health is a critical issue for college students, and institutions of higher education need to explore prevention and support strategies that best meet the needs of their campus,\" said lead researcher Sara Oswalt. She is chair of the department of kinesiology, health and nutrition at the University of Texas at San Antonio.</p><p>It's not clear if the college environment is causing or even contributing to the increase in these problems. But if mental health problems aren't addressed, success in school is jeopardized, she said.</p><p>Oswalt believes more students are seeking help because more of them are suffering from mental health problems, coupled with a willingness to get help. There is less stigma about mental health issues, and schools may be providing more mental health services.</p><p>For the study, Oswalt and her colleagues used data from the American College Health Association to collect information on more than 450,000 undergraduates.</p><p>The investigators found a significant increase in the diagnosis and treatment for eight of 12 mental problems they examined, with anxiety, depression and panic attacks accounting for the biggest increases.</p><p>The researchers also found that students are more willing to use university mental health services. </p><p>By 2015, nearly 20 percent of those surveyed said they used these services, an increase of more than 4 percent since 2009. Moreover, nearly 75 percent said they would consider using university mental health services -- an increase of nearly 7 percent. </p><p>College students' need for mental health resources is increasing, Oswalt said, so schools need to do more to safeguard their students' well-being. They must do it in a way that is effective and use outside services when they cannot handle demand themselves, she suggested.</p><p>Because 75 percent of all serious adult psychiatric illnesses start by age 25, universities have an essential role in addressing mental health issues early, Oswalt explained.</p><p>According to Stewart Cooper, director of counseling services at Valparaiso University in Indiana, \"Oswalt appropriately advocates for a systems approach to respond to these often debilitating disorders among college students.\"</p><p> Cooper suggested several approaches,  starting with ways to avoid emotional problems in healthy students. These include building resilience along with ways to manage stress and get enough sleep. </p><p>In addition, programs are needed that focus on detecting mental health problems early -- making it possible to prevent them from getting worse -- and to minimize complications and limit disabilities before the problem becomes severe. \"Mental health screening days and evidence-based materials and interventions that are technology-based fit here,\" he said. </p><p>Schools also need to offer therapy to students to reduce the negative effect of an already established mental health problem. These programs can help restore function and reduce complications, Cooper said.</p><p>The report was published Oct. 24 in the <i>Journal of American College Health</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.nami.org/Find-Support/Teens-Young-Adults/Managing-a-Mental-Health-Condition-in-College\" target=\"_new\"> National Alliance on Mental Illness</a> for more on mental health among college students.</p>",

She's an emergency medicine resident with the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Three of the patients died from their overdose, Khatri and her colleagues reported in the Nov. 1 <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p>Fentanyl has been increasingly found in drugs seized by law enforcement, said Emily Feinstein, executive vice president of the Center on Addiction, in New York City.</p><p>These illegal drugs include heroin and cocaine, as well as methamphetamine, ketamine and counterfeit prescription pills, Feinstein said.</p><p>Fentanyl is 50 to 100 times more potent than heroin, and an amount equivalent to the size of a grain of rice can kill you, she said.</p><p>\"Fentanyl is so cheap, and the drug cartels have great access to it. It is a tremendously effective filler because it's highly addicting. If it doesn't kill them, people get an intense reaction that creates addiction,\" Feinstein explained. \"It's cheap, it has a strong high and it makes people come back for more.\"</p><p>Between 2012 and 2016 there's been a 23-fold increase in the number of deaths involving cocaine in combination with synthetic opioids, according to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse. That amounted to 4,184 deaths in 2016.</p><p>\"We're really in a fentanyl epidemic right now,\" Feinstein said. \"Overdose death rates are really driven by fentanyl.\"</p><p>At Khatri's hospital, the 18 patients all came in with textbook signs of opioid poisoning -- lethargy, pinpoint pupils and dangerous slowing of their respiration.</p><p>Doctors administered the OD drug naloxone to 17 patients, who required higher doses than are usually needed to reverse an opioid overdose.</p><p>Urine tests drawn from 16 of the patients showed they had used cocaine, and 15 patients also had confirmed fentanyl exposure in concentrations consistent with severe poisoning, the study authors said.</p><p>Khatri recommended that hospital emergency departments keep rapid-testing strips for fentanyl on hand, so doctors can respond quickly to unintentional fentanyl overdoses.</p><p>Fentanyl has been making its way into both crack and powder cocaine, Feinstein said.</p><p>The New York City Department of Health has launched a campaign aimed at protecting young adults who party in bars and occasionally use cocaine, Feinstein said.</p><p>Bartenders are being trained to administer naloxone, and signs are being hung in bathrooms warning people not to use cocaine by themselves, she said.</p><p>\"This is an opioid-naive population that is recreationally using cocaine and not realizing how prevalent fentanyl is,\" Feinstein said.</p><p>Feinstein emphasized how quickly fentanyl can kill.</p><p>\"If you experience an overdose, the time to death is much shorter than heroin.

All had received care through the U.S. military health care system.</p><p>As to why a link was seen, investigators theorized it could have to do with the impact such medications have on the delicate microbial environment (microbiome) found in a growing child's gut.</p><p>\"We did not evaluate the microbiome status of these children,\" stressed study author Dr. Cade Nylund, a lieutenant colonel with Medical Corps of the U.S. Air Force. \"And this was an observational study, so we can only demonstrate the findings of an association, not a specific cause.</p><p>\"So we presume this has to do with changes in a child's microbiome brought on by these medications,\" he added. \"But it could also just be the result of having an infection. Or having a fever, maybe with or without taking antibiotics. Or it might have something to do with the psychosocial dynamics of a family. We don't yet know.\"</p><p>As to what parents should make of these findings, Nylund said the most important thing is to ensure that children take the medications they need, but not when it isn't warranted.</p><p>For example, Nylund noted that acid reflux medications -- such as histamine blockers and proton pump inhibitors -- \"are often prescribed in infants when they're not indicated. Acid reflux is normal in infants, and not really a good reason to put them on reflux meds. And most infants grow out of the problem by 12 months.\"</p><p>On the other hand, Nylund acknowledged that \"antibiotics play a big role in treating infections, and they always will.</p><p>\"And I would certainly hate for a parent to not treat a child with antibiotics for an infection out of a concern for obesity,\" he added.</p><p>In the study, published Nov. 1 in the journal <i>Gut</i>, researchers followed roughly 333,000 children born between 2006 and 2013.</p><p>More than 241,000 had been prescribed antibiotics before the age of 2. Nearly 40,000 had been prescribed histamine blockers, while more than 11,000 had been prescribed proton pump inhibitors. Almost 6,000 kids had been prescribed all three drugs.</p><p>Based on an average of four pediatrician visits after age 2 and up until age 8, investigators determined that nearly 47,000 children (14 percent) became obese. Of these, about 9,600 had never been prescribed an antibiotic or acid reflux medication while an infant; the rest had.</p><p>After stacking medication histories up against obesity incidence, the research team concluded that infants prescribed antibiotics faced a 26 percent greater risk for childhood obesity by the age of 3. That risk rose the longer an infant had taken antibiotics, and among infants who had taken medications in multiple antibiotic classes.</p><p>Acid reflux medications also appeared to raise childhood obesity risk, though the connection was characterized as \"weak.\"</p><p>Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a senior scientist in child health research at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, said the findings are interesting because they raise \"questions about factors such as antibiotics and medications that alter gut microbiome and can potentially influence other health conditions.\" She was not involved with the study.</p><p>But Gupta cautioned that for now the findings should only be viewed as an \"important association.\" More research will be needed \"to truly understand cause and effect, as it is a complex condition influenced by many environmental, behavioral and genetic factors,\" she said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more information on obesity and obesity risk factors at <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/overweight-and-obesity\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</a>.</p>",

After adjusting for various factors, they found that those who said they brushed less than twice a day for less than two minutes had a three-fold increased heart risk, compared to those who said they brushed at least twice a day for at least two minutes.</p> <p>Dr. Shogo Matsui, the study's lead researcher, said the findings suggest \"poor oral health, based on daily teeth-brushing behavior, is associated with\" poorer heart health. It's possible that longer tooth brushing might reduce this risk, but the new study was not designed to prove cause-and-effect, said Matsui, a researcher at the Institute of Biomedical and Health Sciences at Hiroshima University in Japan.</p> <p>Dr. Ann Bolger, a cardiologist and professor of medicine emeritus at the University of California, San Francisco, agreed that the observational study had limitations.</p> <p>\"It is possible that people who are very attentive to their dental health are also very attentive to other aspects of their health,\" said Bolger, who was not involved in the research.</p> <p>Even so, Bolger said the science supports a potential connection between dental health and heart health. Gum disease is one of the diseases \"where the body may be in a sort of continual state of inflammation, and this seems to be a very powerful predictor of cardiovascular disease,\" she said.</p> <p>A separate study published last month in the journal <i>Hypertension</i> found that gum disease appears to worsen blood pressure and interferes with medications to treat hypertension.</p><p>Poor dental health also poses a risk to people with heart valve problems, Bolger said.</p> <p>\"I spend an inordinate amount of time talking to (heart valve patients) about their teeth because we know certain heart valve infections can be associated with poor oral health,\" she said.</p> <p>This latest research \"is a good reminder that the mouth is an important part of a person's entire health and simple, daily behaviors that improve health are incredibly important.\"</p> <p>The American Dental Association recommends brushing your teeth twice a day for two minutes with fluoride toothpaste.</p> <p>\"It's a low-risk, low-cost option that we know has other benefits even beyond the scope of what this study is trying to investigate,\" Bolger said. \"There's no reason not to recommend someone do this.\"</p>",

Wait times, which are partially driven by the geographic availability of donor organs, are generally months long. </p> <p>In the study, presented Saturday at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions conference in Chicago, researchers looked at people awaiting their first heart transplant between 2005 and 2016. Of the 36,801 patients, about 67 percent were white, 22 percent were African-American and 8 percent were Hispanic. </p> <p> The wait time peaked in 2014 for patients across all racial and ethnic groups but was disproportionately longer for African-American patients -- a median of 19.8 months compared with 12 months for white patients and 12.3 months for Hispanic patients. The disparity was less pronounced in the years that followed. In 2016, for example, median wait time was 10.1 months for African-American patients, eight months for white patients, and 7.4 months for Hispanic patients.</p> <p>\"After adjusting for some of the variables that could impact wait time like age, blood type and geographical region, the time to transplant was observed to be longer for African-Americans compared to whites,\" said Dr. Anuradha Lala, lead author of the study and an assistant professor at Mount Sinai Medical School in New York City.</p> <p>Lala cautioned that it's too early to draw definite conclusions about what caused the difference in wait time. The findings, she said, did not account for other factors that may have had an impact.</p> <p>\"It is important to understand whether disparities exist and, if so, the next step is to understand the factors that underlie the differences in wait times and, of those factors, which can we target for intervention to reduce or eliminate disparities,\" she said.</p> <p> However, wait times and donor supply are dynamic and can change rapidly, and some experts are skeptical that the differences are due to race.</p> <p>\"I don't think we can infer a high degree of bias in the decision (of heart allocation). So much is driven by objective measures,\" said Dr. Clyde Yancy, chief of cardiology and Magerstadt Professor of Medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.</p> <p>\"It's impossible to control for all other variables and have race and ethnicity emerge as the predominant reason for longer wait times. You're dealing with people at the edge of life with a number of comorbidities and variables that determine their clinical stability or instability,\" said Yancy, who was not involved in the study. \"We will use those hearts in the very best way we can, for those who are desperately ill and have a chance of surviving.\"</p> <p> Lala believes this is an important area for ongoing investigation, especially in light of the United Network for Organ Sharing's new heart allocation system that took effect last month. The new system is designed to ensure that the most critically ill patients receive a transplant sooner. Candidates are now listed according to six medical urgency statuses and there's more flexibility in terms of how far a heart can travel from donor to recipient.</p> <p> But it's unclear how the new system will ultimately impact wait times and outcomes. </p> <p>\"We need to continually look at wait times under the new system,\" Lala said. \"If we notice there are disparities, we need to try to understand why and what can be done to minimize them.\"</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 13, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- The sharp and sudden pain from an aortic dissection, along with the emergency treatment that follows, can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder years later, a new study finds.</p> <p> An aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition in which a tear in the wall of the aorta -- the major artery carrying blood out of the heart -- allows blood to rush between the wall's layers. Most people who have one say they feel a sudden ripping or stabbing chest pain that sometimes spreads to the back. It is usually treated with surgery and medication.</p> <p> In a study of aortic dissection patients treated at the Cleveland Clinic, researchers reached out to 295 people with an online survey that included four questions commonly used to screen for PTSD. </p> <p> Patients were asked whether they startled easily, or felt constantly on guard since their dissection. They also were asked about feeling numb or detached from others, whether they had nightmares or unwelcome thoughts about their dissection, or if they went out of their way to avoid situations that reminded them of it.</p> <p> About 44 percent of those surveyed, or 129 people, answered all four screening questions. Of that group, 22 percent screened positive for PTSD. The results \"absolutely shocked\" researchers, said Selena Pasadyn, a medical student at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine and the study's lead investigator.</p> <p>\"We're advancing a lot in our care for these patients. We're able to get them through this acute event, but it's also our responsibility as physicians to think about their long-term quality of life,\" Pasadyn said. \"This is a cry to physicians to consider PTSD, to screen for it, and to refer and treat appropriately.\" </p> <p> She said she also hopes to raise awareness among patients so they can become better advocates for themselves.</p> <p>\"They need to be aware that they may feel watchful. They may feel on guard or startled,\" she said. \"They need to know these are normal feelings, but they're also treatable feelings.\"</p> <p> The average age of the patient responding to the survey was 54, and the average time that had passed since their aortic dissection was about seven years, she said.</p> <p> The findings were presented Saturday at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions conference, in Chicago.</p> <p> While the study is one of only a few to look specifically at aortic dissection patients, related research has found that about 15 to 25 percent of heart attack and stroke survivors also screen positive for PTSD, said Donald Edmondson, director of Columbia University's Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health in New York City.</p> <p> An aortic dissection has all of the characteristics of a PTSD-inducing cardiovascular event, he said.</p> <p>\"Any type of event that is sudden onset, highly painful, and life-threatening has the potential to cause PTSD,\" said Edmondson, who was not involved in the new study. \"But what's unique and special about medical events like this is that unlike combat or sexual assault, where people can find a safe place where they're not at risk, someone who's had an aortic dissection or a heart attack or stroke can never get away from their heart (or brain).\"</p> <p> Edmondson said that heart attack survivors with PTSD are at double the risk of having another attack or dying within the next year than a survivor who is not under similar distress.</p> <p> There are two reasons for this, he said. One has to do with the body's natural reaction to stress. Just thinking about a traumatic event can make some people hyperventilate or become lightheaded.</p> <p>\"Often when people become aware of their physiological signals, like feeling short of breath, it distresses them. It makes them worry they're going to have another cardiovascular event, which of course makes their heart rate go faster,\" Edmondson said. \"That vicious cycle appears to contribute to secondary risk.\" </p> <p> Heart attack and stroke survivors with PTSD also are less likely to take medicine prescribed to help prevent future events. </p> <p>\"Their medications serve as reminders of their cardiovascular event and the fact that they're still at risk,\" Edmondson said. \"They try to avoid thinking about that, even though they think about it all the time.\"</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 14, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Strictly limiting carbohydrates and eating more fat may help the body burn more calories, a new clinical trial shows.</p><p>Researchers found that among 164 adults in a weight-loss study, those placed on a low-carb, high-fat diet burned more daily calories, versus those given high-carb meals. On average, their bodies used up 250 extra calories per day over 20 weeks.</p><p>The researchers estimated that over three years, that would translate into an additional 20-pound weight loss for an average-height man.</p><p>\"This study refutes the conventional thinking that it's only calorie-cutting that matters,\" said senior researcher Dr. David Ludwig. He is co-director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children's Hospital.</p><p>Instead, he said, the source of those calories may make the difference in whether your metabolism \"works with you or against you.\"</p><p>According to Ludwig, the findings support a theory called the \"carbohydrate-insulin model.\" The premise is that diets heavy in processed carbs send insulin levels soaring, which drives the body to use fewer calories, and instead store more of them as fat.</p><p>\"Our study suggests that you'll do better if you focus on reducing refined carbohydrates, rather than focusing on reducing calories alone,\" Ludwig said.</p><p>He and his colleagues reported the findings online Nov. 14 in the  <i>BMJ</i>.</p><p>Many studies over the years have attempted to answer the question of whether low-fat or low-carb is better for weight loss. Often, they've concluded there is little difference.</p><p>But those studies, Ludwig said, have typically been behavioral studies where people may or may not stick with their diets.</p><p>So his team conducted a \"feeding study\" to carefully control what people ate.</p><p>First, 234 overweight and obese adults were recruited for a \"run-in\" phase, with the goal of losing about 12 percent of their weight over 10 weeks. Their diets were low-calorie and had moderate amounts of carbs.</p><p>Of that group, 164 lost enough weight and moved on to the next phase. They were randomly assigned to either a low-carb, moderate-carb or high-carb diet for 20 weeks.</p><p>People on the low-carb diet got 20 percent of their calories from carbs like vegetables, fruits and beans; a full 60 percent of their calories came from fat, including sources like meat, whole milk, cheese and nuts. The remaining 20 percent of calories came from protein.</p><p>The situation was flipped for people on the high-carb plan: 60 percent of calories from carbs and 20 percent from fat. The moderate plan divided the two nutrients equally, at 40/40.</p><p>After 20 weeks, the low-carb group appeared to be burning more calories -- an average of 250 more per day, versus the high-carb group, and 111 more than the moderate-carb group.</p><p>The researchers did not look at the effects on any further weight loss. Instead, each person's calorie intake was calibrated to maintain what they'd already lost. The point, Ludwig explained, was to zero in on the effects of the different diets on calorie burning.</p><p>According to Dr. Anastassia Amaro, medical director of Penn Metabolic Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, \"The study design is very clever.\" </p><p>Amaro, who was not involved in the research, said she already suggests that patients cut back on carbs when they are trying to lose weight.</p><p>These findings, she said, will boost her confidence in that advice.</p><p>However, Amaro said, the low-carb diet used in this study is not ready for a \"direct translation\" into the real world. For one, she explained, it's not clear whether it's the lack of carbs that was key.</p><p>\"This is also a high-fat diet,\" Amaro pointed out. \"Is it the lack of carbs, the fat content, or both?\"</p><p>What about the nutritional value of such a diet? Ludwig said it's healthy -- allowing fruit, legumes and an \"unlimited\" amount of vegetables, for instance.</p><p>\"What it doesn't have is grains and added sugar,\" he said.</p><p>Ludwig agreed, however, that more research is needed to show whether the approach is the best way to maintain weight loss. He and his colleagues recently started a new trial that will pit a very low-carb diet against one that is high-carb but low in sugar, and another that is high-carb/high-sugar.</p><p>And what about people who currently have a healthy weight? Would a low-carb, high-fat diet cause their bodies to burn more calories?</p><p>That's a \"good question,\" Amaro said -- but this study can't answer it.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Harvard School of Public Health has more on <a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/carbohydrates/\" target=\"_new\">carbohydrates</a>.</p>",

Among the moms of babies who used pacifiers, 30 cleaned the pacifier by sterilization, 53 hand-washed the pacifier, and nine cleaned the pacifier by sucking it.</p><p>\"We found the children of mothers who sucked on the pacifier had lower IgE levels,\" said lead author Dr. Eliane Abou-Jaoude, from the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit.</p><p>IgE is a type of antibody related to allergic responses in the body.

Don't forget that certain foods can help protect your bones, a nutrition expert says.</p><p>\"Bone disease is often preventable by getting enough calcium and vitamin D into your diet,\" said Kathryn Weatherford, a registered dietitian at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.</p><p>\"By eating the right combination of calcium- and vitamin D-rich foods, we can boost our immune system and protect our bones,\" she said. \"Many foods are now fortified in calcium and vitamin D, making it easier to meet our daily recommended intake.\"</p><p>Start your day with a calcium-fortified cereal that is high in fiber (more than 3 grams) and low in sugar. Whole grain cereal with a cup of milk adds up to 600 milligrams (mg) of calcium.</p><p>Fatty fish is also an excellent source of vitamin D. A 3-ounce portion of wild salmon provides more than 100 percent of daily value of vitamin D, according to Weatherford.</p><p>Eat a variety of dark, leafy greens such as spinach, kale, Swiss chard and bok choy, she added.</p><p>An 8-ounce serving of yogurt provides 400 mg of calcium. Choose non-fat yogurt or Greek yogurt, which provides additional protein.</p><p>Another suggestion is milk alternatives. Whether it is almond, soy, cashew or hemp milk, almost all milk alternatives are fortified with both vitamin D and calcium. For example, almond milk provides up to 45 percent of daily value of calcium and 25 percent of daily value of vitamin D, Weatherford said.</p><p>Your body also produces vitamin D when exposed to sunlight. Just 10 to 15 minutes of sunshine a day can produce enough vitamin D.</p><p>It's important to monitor how much calcium and vitamin D you consume each day. If you suspect you're not getting enough, talk to your doctor or dietitian, Weatherford suggested.</p><p>\"It's good to know if you're vitamin D-deficient so you can take steps to fix the problem and keep building strong bones,\" Weatherford said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Library of Medicine has more on <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002405.htm\" target=\"_new\">vitamin D</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Oct. 25, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Although this flu season is off to a slow start, U.S. health officials are urging everyone to get vaccinated now.</p><p>Why? Last year was one of the worst flu seasons on record, yet fewer Americans got a flu shot than in years past. In fact, less than four in 10 adults were protected against flu and its complications last winter, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>\"Right now flu activity is low, with just a smattering of cases,\" said Dr. Alicia Fry. She is chief of the epidemiology and prevention branch in the CDC's influenza division.</p><p>\"Now is the perfect time to get vaccinated &hellip; it gives your body enough time to respond to the vaccine and mount a good immune response so you're ready for the flu season,\" Fry said.</p><p>October is the best time to get a flu shot. The vaccine reduces your odds of influenza, and if you get the flu it makes it much milder, she added.</p><p>The vaccine also reduces deaths among children, as well as hospitalizations among pregnant women, Fry said.</p><p>The vaccine is particularly important for women who have children too young to get a flu shot, people aged 65 and older, and anyone with chronic heart or lung disease.</p> <p>About 132 million doses of the vaccine have been distributed so far, and about 168 million will be available through the 2018-2019 flu season, according to Fry.</p><p>Several viruses are circulating, including influenza A strains H1N1 and H3N2, and two influenza B viruses. \"It's not clear if there is going to be one virus that's going to win and be the dominant virus,\" she noted.</p><p>Fry said she hopes this flu season will be milder than the last, \"but we can't predict that.\"</p><p>Last flu season saw record numbers of deaths and hospitalizations. The CDC estimates that the flu sickened 49 million, hospitalized nearly 1 million and killed 79,000.</p><p>Nearly 12 million children came down with the flu, and 48,000 were hospitalized, CDC statistics show. Of those, 183 died. Among those aged 18 to 64, 30 million were sickened and 10,300 died.</p><p>In all, 70 percent of those hospitalized for flu were aged 65 and older, as were 90 percent of those who died, according to the CDC.</p><p>Last year was the worst season since 2009 when the pandemic H1N1 flu virus hit, health officials said. </p><p>This year's vaccine should be a better match to the circulating virus than last year's, Fry noted. </p><p>For H1N1, the vaccine is up to 60 percent effective, as it is for the influenza B viruses. For the H3N2 virus it's less effective, since H3 viruses can change to fool the body's immune system, she explained.</p><p>This year, the H3N2 virus component of the vaccine has been tweaked to better match the circulating strain, Fry added.</p><p>\"The vaccine is the best protection against getting the flu or being hospitalized or dying from flu,\" she stressed. </p><p>The flu activity report was published Oct. 26 in the CDC's <i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">the flu</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Dec. 7, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Hot flashes, a common curse in menopause, can be especially bothersome after breast cancer. But a new study suggests an existing medication may help.</p><p>The drug is oxybutynin (Ditropan XL), long  used to treat urinary incontinence.</p><p>The study found that women taking the medicine had an average of five fewer hot flashes a week, compared with three fewer among women taking a placebo.  </p><p>\"Oxybutynin is an option that can control these symptoms and improve quality of life,\" said lead researcher Dr. Roberto Leon-Ferre, an assistant professor of oncology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.</p><p>There are a couple of reasons for severe hot flashes after breast cancer. Chemotherapy may induce early menopause, and drugs that reduce estrogen levels may make hot flashes worse, the research team noted.  </p><p>Hormone replacement therapy, which is often recommended for menopausal symptoms, is generally not advised for breast cancer survivors. That's left women who can't take hormones at a disadvantage.</p><p>Oxybutynin blocks a substance in the brain, and one of its side effects is decreased sweating, Leon-Ferre noted. </p><p>\"Because of this, we can take advantage of the 'side effect' and decrease involuntary sweating associated with hot flashes, and decrease the hot flashes as well,\" he explained.</p><p>The drug could be game-changing for certain women, said Dr. Alice Police, regional director of breast surgery at Northwell Health Cancer Institute in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y.</p><p>\"This is a really important advance in survivorship and compassionate cancer care,\" added Police, who wasn't involved in the study.</p><p>Because oxybutynin is already available for other conditions, Leon-Ferre said doctors could prescribe it off-label.</p><p>However, he cautioned that its long-term effects aren't known. Drugs in this class -- called anticholinergics -- have been linked with mental decline, he said. </p><p>For example, the drugs may raise the risk for problems with short-term memory, reasoning and confusion, and may also hike the risk for dementia among older patients, studies indicate.</p><p>For the new study, Leon-Ferre and his colleagues randomly assigned 150 women who experienced at least 28 hot flashes a week to oxybutynin or a placebo. </p><p>Almost two-thirds were also taking drugs to prevent a return of breast cancer, either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor.</p><p>The women were randomly assigned to one of three groups: low-dose oxybutynin twice a day for six weeks; low-dose oxybutynin for one week followed by an increased dose; or a placebo. </p><p>Both doses appeared to reduce hot flashes better than the placebo.</p><p>And oxybutynin doesn't interfere with the metabolism of tamoxifen, Leon-Ferre said, calling that an important consideration for breast cancer survivors.</p><p>Most insurance covers oxybutynin, and a month's supply can range from $21 to $42. With insurance, copays would be less, he added. </p><p>Side effects included constipation, mild diarrhea, dry mouth, dry eyes, episodes of confusion and difficulty urinating, the researchers found. </p><p>Women taking oxybutynin also reported improvement in work, social activities, leisure activities, sleep and overall quality of life.</p><p>These are vital issues, Police said. \"I will never forget the first time a patient said, 'Thank you for curing my breast cancer, but you ruined my life,' \" she said.</p><p>The patient said endocrine therapy had caused hot flashes so severe that she could not sleep. As a result, she was having trouble at work and in all other aspects of her life, Police recalled.</p> <p>\"Her intimate relationship was also suffering, as nighttime had become a battleground between her and her internal temperature control,\" Police said. </p><p>The patient said she was willing to stop her hormone therapy and risk the return of breast cancer rather than live with her current symptoms, she said.</p><p>\"This study makes me hopeful that these patients may have a way out of their dilemma,\" Police said. \"Instead of just telling them they should be happy to be alive, we may be able to offer a reliable treatment for some of the debilitating side effects of our treatments for breast cancer.\"  </p><p>The research was scheduled to be presented Friday at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in Texas. Studies presented at meetings are usually considered preliminary until peer-reviewed for publication in a medical journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Cancer Institute has more about  <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/hot-flashes-hp-pdq\" target=\"_new\">hot flashes and cancer survivors</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, April 25, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- The idea behind immunotherapy for peanut allergy is appealing in its simplicity: Ask a patient to eat tiny amounts of peanut every day, and over time their immune system will become desensitized to it.</p><p>Unfortunately, this cure might be doing more harm than the allergy itself, a new evidence review suggests.</p><p>People who undergo immunotherapy for their peanut allergies wind up with a large increase in life-threatening anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions, compared to others who either avoid peanuts or are in a placebo group, researchers concluded.</p><p>Peanut immunotherapy triples a patient's risk of anaphylaxis and doubles the chances they'll need to use epinephrine to counter a severe allergic reaction.</p><p>\"We found that patients on immunotherapy, their quality of life wasn't any better,\" said lead researcher Dr. Derek Chu, a fellow in clinical immunology at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada. \"Outside of the clinic, they actually end up having more allergic reactions over time.\"</p><p>Chu's team discovered this troubling fact after pooling results of 12 peanut immunotherapy trials involving more than 1,000 patients.</p><p>\"If you looked at each study one by one, you might not see that,\" Chu said. \"When you combine them all, and you analyze all 1,000 patients in unison, then you can actually see it.\"</p><p>Food allergies affect more than 6 million people, including as many as 8&#37; of children and 3&#37; of adults, researchers said in background notes. Although most kids outgrow allergies to milk or eggs, peanut allergies are lifelong in up to 85&#37; of cases.</p><p>Symptoms can run from runny nose, hives and itching to a tightening of the throat and shortness of breath. Severe reactions can result in anaphylactic shock, which requires immediate treatment with an epinephrine injector and a trip to the emergency room, the Mayo Clinic says.</p><p>Right now, immunotherapy is the only available treatment for severe food allergies, and it has been shown to increase a person's tolerance, Chu said.</p><p>\"There haven't been any other options than avoidance to date, so it's very promising we have something that partially works,\" he said.</p><p>But these results show the price paid for increased tolerance might be too high.</p><p>\"The therapy itself needs to be very carefully reconsidered,\" Chu said. \"That level of protection you get from going through the procedure is variable and often incomplete. Day-to-day, the degree of protection can change, and if you have an infection or an illness or maybe you're just tired that day, you can have a reaction to a dose you previously tolerated.\"</p><p>The 12 clinical trials occurred in the United States, United Kingdom, Europe and Australia. The average age of participants was about 9 years old, and patients were typically followed for a year.</p><p>People undergoing peanut immunotherapy had a 22&#37; risk of anaphylaxis, compared with 7&#37; for untreated peanut allergy sufferers, researchers found.</p><p>The chance that a peanut immunotherapy patient would require an epinephrine injection is about 8&#37;, compared to about 4&#37; for those not receiving treatment.</p><p>Allergic reactions involving the gastrointestinal tract, skin, nose and lungs also increased.</p><p>Researchers concluded that folks might want to simply avoid peanuts rather than undergo immunotherapy if they want to prevent anaphylaxis and allergic reactions.</p><p>The new evidence review was published online April 25 in <i>The Lancet</i>.</p><p>While these findings are food for thought, it's too early to completely count out immunotherapy, said Dr. Scott Sicherer, director of the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. He wasn't involved with the study.</p><p>\"Although this is a very important paper pointing out a major issue with this particular approach, it's not the end of the story,\" Sicherer said. \"It's still a viable approach. It does change the threshold for a majority of patients. But it requires a discussion between the doctor and the patient of the risks and benefits.\"</p><p>Sicherer noted that there is no immunotherapy for food approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Allergy doctors instead create their own \"home brew\" for patients, providing either tiny amounts of the food or capsules containing refined versions of the allergen.</p><p>That's one problem with current immunotherapy practice, Chu said.</p><p>\"Anytime we take something that's completely natural, and we distill it and put it in a capsule, that's a drug now,\" he said. \"That's not just something as simple as an off-the-shelf product anymore.\"</p><p>Sicherer's center doesn't offer immunotherapy as a regular clinical option, because the treatment is not FDA-approved, he said.</p><p>Assuming it ever gets approved, he envisions a conversation where he'd discuss the risks and benefits with a child's caregivers.</p><p>\"This is a therapy where there's a two-thirds chance it's going to increase the amount of peanut your child can eat before reaction, but going onto this therapy on average results in more anaphylaxis and allergic reactions than if you didn't go on this therapy,\" Sicherer said.</p><p>The therapy would reduce the chances of an accidental allergic reaction caused by traces of peanut winding up in a restaurant meal, but there also could be an out-of-the-blue reaction to the therapy itself, he said.</p><p>Chu and Sicherer agreed better treatments are needed.</p><p>And that might be on the way. Earlier this month, researchers announced a potential medication for peanut allergy that would halt violent reactions by blocking the immune system's antibodies from responding to the allergen. It was published in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>.</p><p>\"There's a lot of promise from a lot of different approaches, and I would imagine that we're going to end up in a place,  hopefully not too long from now, where we could say, there's seven different options and looking at your situation the best is this one or that one,\" Sicherer said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Stanford University has more about <a href=\"http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2018/11/5-questions-progress-in-peanut-allergy-immunotherapy.html\" target=\"_new\">peanut immunotherapy</a>.</p>",

He is director of the Lymphoma Immunotherapy Program at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.</p><p>\"We're injecting two immune stimulants right into one single tumor,\" Brody said. \"We inject one tumor and we see all of the other tumors just melt away.\"</p><p>Eight out of 11 lymphoma patients in a small,  early clinical trial experienced partial or complete destruction of the tumor that received the initial injection, according to the report published April 8 in the journal <i>Nature Medicine</i>.</p><p>The vaccine also halted overall cancer progression in six patients for three to 18 months, and caused significant regression or actual remission in three patients, the investigators found.</p><p>The results were solid enough that the research team is expanding its next clinical trial to include lymphoma, breast, and head and neck cancer patients, Brody said. That trial started in March.</p><p>Prior efforts at unleashing the immune system to fight cancer have focused on T-cells, which Brody calls the \"soldiers\" of the immune army because they directly attack harmful invaders in the body.</p><p>Drugs called checkpoint inhibitors help T-cells identify cancer cells as the bad guys and kill them off.</p><p>\"We call them the 'Jimmy Carter' medicines because that's what Jimmy got when he had very advanced-stage melanoma,\" Brody said.</p><p>But the checkpoint inhibitors have typically only been able to help about one in five cancer patients significantly, \"so there's lots of room for improvement,\" he added.</p><p>This new vaccine approach focuses on dendritic cells, which Brody calls the \"generals\" of the immune system's army. Dendritic cells guide the response of T-cells to fight off invaders.</p><p>\"We're trying to mobilize these immune generals to tell the soldiers what to do,\" Brody said.</p><p>Patients first received nine daily injections of an immune stimulant intended to \"recruit\" dendritic cells by teaching them how to recognize cancerous cells, the study authors said.</p><p>The patients then received eight injections of a second stimulant that \"activates\" the dendritic cells, prompting them to instruct T-cells to hunt and destroy the now revealed cancer cells in the body.</p><p>Essentially, the method turns the injected tumor into a cancer vaccine factory, the researchers explained.</p><p>The approach differs from traditional vaccines for the flu or measles because those are preventive, teaching the body beforehand how to fight off an infectious disease, Brody pointed out.</p><p>This vaccine is therapeutic. \"We're trying to teach the immune system to get rid of the thing even after you've already got the problem,\" he said.</p><p>Lab tests involving mice show that this vaccine approach could be at least three times more powerful if combined with checkpoint inhibitors, Brody added.</p><p>Because of this, patients in the new trial will receive both the vaccine and checkpoint inhibitors, the researchers said.</p><p>Susanna Greer, scientific director of clinical cancer research and immunology for the American Cancer Society, said that \"priming\" dendritic cells inside a person's tumor to produce the best anti-tumor immune response \"suggests a promising immunotherapy strategy.\"</p><p>\"Additional human studies are warranted to confirm these findings,\" Greer said.</p><p>Dr. Catherine Diefenbach, director of clinical lymphoma at the NYU Langone Perlmutter Cancer Center in New York City, said the vaccine approach is \"novel and extremely interesting,\" and could help explain why checkpoint inhibitors usually don't help patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</p><p>However, she noted that really only three of the 11 patients in the initial clinical trial had truly meaningful responses to the vaccine.</p><p>\"These are indolent lymphoma patients,\" said Diefenbach, an expert for the American Society of Clinical Oncology. \"The fact there was stable disease doesn't really mean anything because these cancers don't grow fast.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Cancer Society has more about <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/treatment-types/immunotherapy/what-is-immunotherapy.html\" target=\"_new\">cancer immunotherapy</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 6, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Gavin Kuykendall's life has been shaped by his fight against heart disease. Now almost 12, he recently expressed all he's been through -- by writing a letter to his heart disease.</p> <p>\"You made my parents very sad,\" he said, reading his letter in a video. \"You tried to make my birthday an overwhelming and unhappy day. Even though you made me incredibly sick, I was brave, I was strong.\"</p> <p>Like all first-time parents-to-be, Faith and Adam Kuykendall were looking forward to their 20-week ultrasound and the chance to take another peek at their unborn child. </p> <p>\"Everything was going great until the doctor got to the heart,\" Faith said. \"You could just see his face drop and he said, 'Oh no.' \"</p> <p>Tests showed their son had a rare condition in which the left ventricle doesn't develop properly. It's called hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). The left ventricle is responsible for pumping freshly oxygenated blood out to the rest of the body.</p> <p>Without immediate intervention, HLHS is fatal, usually within days or weeks.</p> <p>Such specialized care wasn't available in their hometown of Tulsa. Their frequent medical appointments and the delivery would need to be in Oklahoma City, nearly two hours away.</p> <p>Gavin arrived after 28 hours of labor. Although Faith and Adam had been warned they could see a child \"blue and limp or not breathing,\" he came out screaming -- a great sign.</p> <p>Four days later, Gavin underwent open-heart surgery to create a way for the right ventricle to pump blood to both the lungs and the body. Doctors implanted a shunt that directs blood to the lungs.</p> <p>Doctors left the incision open for a few days until the swelling subsided.</p> <p>\"That was the worst,\" Faith said. \"He was naked and swollen. You could literally see his heart beating in his chest.\"</p> <p>Gavin remained in the hospital for a month. Four months later, it was time for a second procedure.</p> <p>Typically, this one is easier on the child. But Gavin \"wasn't eating, his left side wasn't functioning, and he was shaking,\" Faith said.</p> <p>Doctors discovered that not only had Gavin suffered a stroke during surgery, he'd become addicted to the powerful narcotics he'd been given. He was going through withdrawal, for which he was treated with methadone.</p> <p>Those first few years were tough for the Kuykendalls. Family, their church community and others in their support system helped them persevere, providing meals and ensuring that someone was always with Gavin. </p> <p>\"We even had a family CPR class so everyone would know what to do, just in case,\" Faith said.</p> <p>Their network came through again in 2009, when it was time for a third surgery.</p> <p>The surgeon who'd cared for Gavin had left Oklahoma for San Diego, leaving their home state without anyone capable of performing the operation. </p> <p>Friends and family helped raise the needed funds to travel to San Diego to stay with the same doctor. And all went well. At 2 1/2, Gavin's heart was rebuilt to the best of expectations. A few months later, Gavin became a big brother. Brody was born, thankfully with a well-formed heart. </p> <p>\"That kid is a walking comedian,\" Faith said. \"I think God knew we needed that.\"</p> <p>Gavin was 5 1/2 when he began facing more complications. Doctors determined he needed a pacemaker to help his heart beat in a regular rhythm. The family again returned to San Diego for the surgery.</p> <p>Around the same time, a close friend of the Kuykendalls -- Brandon Weeden -- was selected in the first round of the National Football League draft. Brandon's wife, Melanie, and Adam had worked together just out of college, and the couples had become close friends. </p> <p>The Weedens were disappointed to learn that the state of Oklahoma lacked the specialists to operate on Gavin and other children. So after signing his NFL contract, Weeden started a foundation, which in turn helped establish a cardiac surgery research program at The Children's Hospital in Oklahoma City.</p> <p>\"I have so much respect for Gavin and the whole family,\" said Weeden, who now plays for the Houston Texans. \"He's already been through more in his lifetime than I'll ever go through. We have birthdays a day apart and try to celebrate together. I just think the world of him.\"</p> <p>Gavin is now in sixth grade and plays right field on his baseball team. Although he also loves football, he's not allowed to play contact sports. </p> <p>\"Of course he wants to do what all the other boys are doing, and that's a struggle,\" Faith said. \"Although he has some anxieties, and some physical and intellectual limitations, I don't want him to think that heart disease defines him. Luckily, he is the most determined, strong-willed child.\"</p> <p>Gavin said he's particularly proud of inspiring Weeden's foundation to help other children in Oklahoma. </p> <p>\"I want people to know that no matter what you have, or what you feel like, you're not alone,\" Gavin said. \"You can do this.\"</p>",

The causes of the condition remain unclear, but many patients say their condition began after their immune system fought off an infection.</p><p>One problem in trying to determine the causes of chronic fatigue syndrome is that it's impossible to assess patients before the illness develops. In this study, researchers used a model for chronic fatigue syndrome based on the hepatitis C treatment interferon-alpha.</p><p>Interferon-alpha triggers immune system activity in much the same way as a major infection does, the study authors explained in a college news release. Many patients who receive interferon-alpha develop acute fatigue during treatment and some have fatigue that lasts for more than six months after treatment ends.</p><p>In the new study, the researchers assessed fatigue and immune system activity in 55 patients before, during and after treatment with interferon-alpha. The investigators discovered differences between the immune systems of 18 patients who developed long-term fatigue and those who had a normal recovery.</p><p>Those 18 patients had a much stronger immune response during treatment with interferon-alpha, with a doubling in the levels of immune system messenger molecules called interleukin-10 and interleukin-6, according to the report.</p><p>Even before treatment started, levels of interleukin-10 were higher among the 18 patients who later developed long-term fatigue, suggesting the immune system may have been primed to overreact, the study authors explained.</p><p>Yet, there was no difference before treatments between the groups in their levels of fatigue or in psychiatric symptoms, like depression or recent stressful events, the scientists noted.</p><p>The study findings were published Dec. 17 in the journal <i>Psychoneuroendocrinology</i>.</p> <p>According to senior researcher Carmine Pariante, \"A better understanding of the biology underlying the development of CFS is needed to help patients suffering with this debilitating condition. Although screening tests are a long way off, our results are the first step in identifying those at risk and catching the illness in its crucial early stages.\"</p><p>Further research is needed to confirm that the findings from patients treated with interferon-alpha would also apply to people with chronic fatigue syndrome, and to better understand the factors that may be driving an exaggerated immune response, the study authors said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Office on Women's Health has more on <a href=\"https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/chronic-fatigue-syndrome\" target=\"_new\">chronic fatigue syndrome</a>.</p>",

She is an assistant professor with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.</p><p>\"That itself, even if you don't lose weight, is going to lead to beneficial changes that end up leading to you having a longer life span,\" Liu said.</p><p>The study findings were presented Saturday at the  American Heart Association annual meeting, in Chicago. Research presented at meetings should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>Previous research has shown that higher fitness is associated with lower risk of heart-related death, even in the obese, Liu said. It's also been shown that people who are obese-but-fit can have a comparable life span to fit people of normal weight.</p><p>For the  new study, Liu and her colleagues compared two different groups of obese people who participated in the Dallas Heart Study, a long-term research effort aimed at improving diagnosis, prevention and treatment of heart disease.</p><p>The investigators used data gathered for the study to identify nearly 1,100 participants with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more, which is the technical definition of obesity.</p><p>The researchers then sorted the obese people based on stress tests that revealed their VO2 max, a measurement of the maximum amount of oxygen a person can utilize during intense exercise.</p><p>There were 716 people who qualified as obese and fit based on stress tests, and 356 qualified as obese and unfit.</p><p>Obese-but-fit people had 44 percent lower pulse rates, 37 percent better heart function and 43 percent lower body fat than those who were obese and unfit, the findings showed. The obese-but-fit participants also had BMIs that were 37 percent lower than those who didn't work out.</p><p>These results should be encouraging to people who started exercising to lose weight but have been unable to keep losing it, Liu said.</p><p>\"The majority of the people reach a plateau where they no longer lose weight even though they're still active and exercising, and trying to build up their fitness,\" Liu said. \"At that point, even if you stay the same weight, you're still gaining the benefits of having higher fitness.\"</p><p>Much of the benefit these people gain is from increasing their lean muscle mass, said Dr. Salim Virani, an associate professor of cardiology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.</p> <p>Muscle weighs more than fat, and it provides a significant boost to your metabolism, said Virani, chair of the American College of Cardiology's Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease Council.</p><p>\"Muscles are very good at taking care of excess sugars in your blood,\" decreasing your risk of diabetes and its heart-related complications, Virani explained.</p><p>\"Even if you are obese, there is a lot of hope by becoming physically fit,\" Virani said. \"Just being physically active adds a lot of mileage in terms of cardiovascular health.

Compared with those who weren't bullied, people who said they were bullied frequently (almost every day) in the past 12 months had a 120 percent higher risk of heart disease, the study authors said.</p><p>And compared with those who weren't subjected to workplace violence or threats, those most frequently affected had a 36 percent higher risk of stroke and other brain blood vessel problems, the findings showed.</p><p>Dr. Satjit Bhusri is a cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. Reading over the findings, he said that \"we are starting to understand more and more the concept of stress-induced heart disease, otherwise known as 'broken heart syndrome.' This study shows an association between one such stressor, bullying, and the heart disease.\"</p><p> Reisinger said it makes sense that workplace stressors can tax the heart.</p><p>He  explained that, like many other animals, humans can be stressed into a state of \"arousal\" that, if constant, can do cardiovascular harm.  Workplace bullying, especially, can perpetuate this stressed state \"into our home, recreation, sleep and vacations.\"</p><p>Bosses are the usual sources of this stress, and \"from a human resources perspective, people are said to leave their boss, not their job,\" Reisinger said.  \"Their boss is the person central to maintaining or promoting or ignoring workplace incivility.\"</p><p>But even if you are unfortunate to have a bullying boss, there are ways to cope.</p><p>\"Stress-reduction skills training include such techniques as progressive muscle relaxation, mindfulness skills training, cognitive behavioral skills training, biofeedback, yoga and similar skills,\" Reisinger said. \"These can go a long way in calming your reactions to a hostile work environment.\"</p><p>The findings were published Nov. 18 in the <i>European Heart Journal</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart Association offers advice on <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/how-to-help-prevent-heart-disease-at-any-age\" target=\"_new\">heart disease prevention</a>.</p>",

State health commissioner Dr. Shereef Elnahal says he was notified 10 days after that, on Oct. 19. By that time, five children had already died.</p><p>A new policy is in place requiring immediate notification of the health commissioner and principal deputy when there are outbreaks where children have died, Elnahal said at the hearing, <i>CBS News</i> reported.</p><p>The Wanaque Center owners were not at the hearing, claiming it was not the \"appropriate setting\" to talk about the outbreak.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Worldwide Search For Donors to Help Girl With Rare Blood Type</b></span></p><p>A worldwide search is on for blood donors who can help a 2-year-old girl who's battling cancer and has one of the rarest blood types in the world.</p><p>To survive, Zainab Mughal will likely require blood transfusions from seven to 10 donors, but getting that number could be difficult, <i>CNN</i> reported.</p><p>That's because Zainab has a type of blood found only in people of Pakistani, Indian or Iranian descent, and less than 4 percent of people in those populations may be a match for Zainab, whose family is from Pakistan.</p><p>The global search for suitable donors is being aided by OneBlood, a South Florida nonprofit organization.</p><p>\"We have a zero percent chance of finding compatible blood for this little girl if we look in pretty much any other ethnic group,\" Frieda Bright, a lab manager with OneBlood, said in a video from the organization, <i>CNN</i> reported.</p><p>While the search is global, the ideal outcome would be finding donors in the United States, according to OneBlood.</p><p>The group said the search began in September and so far, two compatible donors in the United States and one in the U.K. have been found, <i>CNN</i> reported.</p><p>Zainab has a cancer called neuroblastoma and requires treatment with chemotherapy.</p><p>\"She's going to need to be completely supported by blood donations in order to survive the cancer treatment in order to kill this cancer,\" Bright said. \"The blood's not going to cure her, but the blood's very, very important to support her while she undergoes the treatment for this particular cancer.\"</p>",

The mammograms took place at 150 facilities in 31 states in the United States.</p><p>The researchers looked at women aged 30 to 39 with three specific risk factors -- dense breasts, prior diagnosis of breast cancer, or breast cancer in a first-degree relative (mother, sister or daughter).</p><p>The investigators compared the results of mammography in these women against mammograms given to women aged 40 to 49 without those risk factors.</p><p>Breast cancer was detected about as often in younger women with these risk factors as in women in their 40s, the researchers found.</p><p>They also determined that women in their 30s with breast cancer risk factors have to come back to the doctor for further testing and biopsy about as often as older women undergoing regular screening.</p><p>\"Women with at least one of these three risk factors likely benefit from screening mammogram beginning at age 30, instead of age 40,\" Lee said.</p><p>The findings were to be presented Wednesday at the Radiological Society of North America annual meeting, in Chicago. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>A breast cancer risk assessment and possible initiation of mammograms at age 30 doesn't necessarily run counter to current screening guidelines, said Robert Smith, vice president of cancer screening for the American Cancer Society.</p><p>\"The ACS guidelines for women at higher risk already recommend breast cancer screening before age 40 if a woman is a carrier of a known or suspected mutation on a breast cancer susceptibility gene, or if she was exposed to radiation treatment for childhood cancer,\" Smith said. </p><p>\"Likewise, women and their doctors can make individual decisions. So if a woman has a family history in a first-degree relative diagnosed before the age of 50, it is not unreasonable for her to seek advice about whether she should begin screening before age 50,\" he said.</p><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation on breast cancer screening also includes some flexibility, saying that the decision to start regular mammography before age 50 \"should be an individual one and take patient context into account.\"</p><p>Smith added that mammograms for women who've already had breast cancer shouldn't really be regarded as screening.</p><p>\"If a woman has prior history of breast cancer, her regular exams are dictated by that experience,\" Smith said. \"Any woman diagnosed with breast cancer will undergo regular surveillance breast imaging from that point forward.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has more about <a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/UpdateSummaryFinal/breast-cancer-screening1?ds=1&s=mammography\" target=\"_new\">breast cancer screening</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Dec. 3, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- More than one-quarter of people with diabetes have skimped on needed insulin because of the drug's soaring price tag, according to a new small study. </p><p>Surveying nearly 200 Americans with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, researchers found 26 percent had underused insulin because of cost.</p><p>But insulin isn't a drug you can safely ration, doctors warn. </p><p>\"For people with type 1 diabetes, insulin is a lifesaving drug. Without it, people can die within days,\" said the study's lead author, Dr. Kasia Lipska, an assistant professor of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine. </p><p>\"About 1 in 5 people with type 2 need insulin to prevent short-term and long-term complications, like blindness, kidney failure and dialysis and heart disease,\" Lipska explained. </p><p>Dr. LaShawn McIver is senior vice president of government affairs and advocacy for the American Diabetes Association (ADA).</p><p>\"People are struggling to afford insulin, and it truly is a life-and-death situation,\" she said. </p><p>A recent survey by the diabetes association found a similar number of people -- 27 percent in their study -- said cost had affected their use or purchase of insulin. Many of them were regularly taking less than their doctor prescribed, were missing doses or switching to a different insulin. </p><p>Insulin costs have gone up dramatically, said Dr. Elisabeth Rosenthal, author of a journal editorial. Both the new study and editorial were published Dec. 3 in <i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p>\"Between 2007 and 2017, the average wholesale price of four of the most popular insulins has more than tripled in price,\" wrote Rosenthal, editor-in-chief of Kaiser Health News. </p><p>\"Between 2010 and 2015, the monthly wholesale price of Humulin, the most popular insulin, rose to nearly $1,100, up from $258 for the average patient,\" she added. </p><p>These skyrocketing prices put a considerable strain on people with type 1 diabetes, who are often young people just getting started in their lives, Rosenthal said. </p><p>Lipska said it's important to be able to quantify the extent of the problem, hence the study. </p><p>The researchers surveyed 199 people with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. All had been prescribed insulin in the past six months. </p><p>Because of cost, 32 percent of those between ages 18 and 44 reported underusing insulin, as did 24 percent of those 44 to 64 years old. Among those 64 and older, 21 percent had underused insulin due to cost. </p><p>Moreover, more than one-third of those who underused insulin never spoke to their physician about it. </p><p>Insulin underuse based on cost wasn't limited to low-wage earners. While nearly 20 percent of people making under $10,000 a year reported skimping on insulin due to cost, so did more than 38 percent of those making between $50,000 and $99,000 a year, the study reported. </p><p>\"People are struggling to afford insulin across all incomes,\" McIver said. </p><p>\"When an unexpected bill lands in your mailbox, it's a crisis, and we hear a lot about the $200,000 bills. But insulin and insulin pump costs, and blood sugar test strips, these costs are persistent, and they're for life,\" Rosenthal said. \"Imagine if your rent suddenly went up $600 a month. It's really unfair to people who have type 1 diabetes.\" </p><p>The new study also found that more than half of people surveyed said they were also having trouble paying for diabetes devices, such as insulin pumps, blood sugar meters and continuous glucose monitors. </p><p>And those cost issues made a difference. People who reported cost-related insulin underuse had three times higher odds of having poor blood sugar control, the study found. </p><p>Lipska and her colleagues agreed said this problem is too big for patients to tackle on their own. </p><p>\"Regulators and the medical community need to intervene to ensure that insulin is affordable to patients who need it,\" they wrote. </p><p>McIver said the ADA is pushing for more transparency across the supply chain to help figure out why costs have gotten so high. She encouraged patients to call their elected officials and share their stories and concerns. </p><p>Lipska said physicians need to be aware that pricing is an issue for their patients. \"Doctors need to talk to their patients and ask them. Patients feel that this isn't a medical issue per se, and may not bring it up. But if you can't afford your medicine, that's part of your care.\" </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>If you can't afford your insulin, the American Diabetes Association suggests possible <a href=\"https://makeinsulinaffordable.org/resources/\" target=\"_new\">resources</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 6, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Brown-bag lunches give you control over what you eat and what your children eat, but studies show that these to-go meals need to be healthier. This is especially important for kids because their eating habits are developed during the preschool years.</p><p>Recent studies have evaluated lunches for preschoolers by comparing their contents to the Healthy Eating Index, which is used to assess how well recommended nutrition guidelines are being followed. The conclusion: there's a lot of room for improvement.</p><p>Out of a possible 100 points, the lunches scored just 52 based on what kids actually ate (lunches as packed were slightly higher, at 58, based on how healthy they were to begin with). Scores were lowest for vegetables, especially greens, followed by seafood, whole grains and plant proteins. While other protein foods and fruit were well represented, foods with empty calories took the top spot.</p><p>So what can you do?</p><p>Start by making small changes to give taste buds time to adjust. Instead of white bread or rolls, switch to 100 percent whole wheat. Or try a wrap -- both you and your kids might find it more fun to eat, and it's easier to sneak in veggies in place of processed cheese slices, for instance.</p><p>Next, ditch pre-sliced deli meats in favor of fresh chicken breast or turkey -- you can roast your own on Sunday and carve slices for lunches throughout the week. Try mashed avocado to add creaminess in place of mayo. Pre-washed and sliced veggies are a timesaver, but if you're on a tight budget, wash and cut them up yourself in advance. One of the healthiest substitutions is replacing a bag of chips with an ounce of nuts if there aren't any nut allergies.</p><p>Also, stock up on essentials like reusable containers and a thermos, great for packing soups and stews, which can also be made in advance. In short order, you'll find that these translate into a money savings compared to the extra cost of buying single-serving packages of snacks and other foods.</p><p>And be sure to get kids involved in the menu planning and prep. They'll be more inclined to eat what they help make and pack.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Health's \"We Can!\" program has more ideas for <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/wecan/downloads/tip-school-lunches.pdf\" target=\"_new\">healthy school lunches</a> that kids will enjoy.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY,  Sept. 18, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Thousands of Americans struggling with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may have a new treatment option to help them breathe easier.</p><p>COPD, which is often linked to smoking, is a progressive deterioration of lung function that involves a combination of bronchitis and emphysema symptoms. It's the third leading cause of death in the United States, and while treatments can ease symptoms, there is no cure for COPD.</p><p>However, researchers on Tuesday presented promising new findings from a phase 2 clinical trial. The trial focused on a new COPD treatment called targeted lung denervation (TLD).</p><p> In this therapy, doctors disrupt nerves lying on the outside of the patients' airways.</p><p>The new trial involved 82 COPD patients treated at medical centers in six European countries. According to the researchers, the treatment reduced problematic symptoms by more than 50 percent compared to patients who got a sham treatment.</p><p>\"We have been able to significantly reduce chronic respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, exacerbations of the disease, infections and hospitalizations in a group of COPD patients who are already on aggressive medical therapy,\" said lead researcher Dr. Dirk-Jan Slebos, of the University Medical Centre Groningen, in the Netherlands. </p><p>In addition, patients saw a better quality of life and improved lung function, he said.</p><p>One expert in respiratory care said new treatment options are needed for COPD patients.</p><p>Dr. Len Horovitz is a pulmonary specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He explained that TLD works by inactivating nerves lying outside the airways.  This results \"in dilatation of previously constricted airways, and less production of mucous,\" he explained.</p><p>\"While there is medication that COPD patients use to accomplish the same effect, the addition of TLD appears to confer additional therapeutic benefit,\" said Horovitz, who wasn't involved in the new trial.</p><p>The study was funded by Nuvaira, the Minneapolis-based maker of TLD technology. The findings were scheduled for presentation Tuesday at the European Respiratory Society International Congress, in Paris.</p><p>In the treatment, a catheter is passed through a tube called a bronchoscope into the lungs. The catheter delivers an electric charge to the nerves on the outside of the airways, altering their normal function.</p><p>This allows the airways to relax and widen, make less mucus and also eases inflammation to the airway wall. The catheter and bronchoscope are then removed.</p><p>When combined with drugs designed to relax the airway, TLD appears to have an even greater effect, the researchers said.</p><p>Among the 82 patients in the trial, the investigators found that in the six months after the procedure, 71 percent of those who received the sham treatment experienced a serious flare-up of their COPD, compared with only 32 percent of those who were treated with TLD.</p><p>\"Furthermore, the positive benefit has continued in those receiving TLD treatment, with the number of patients hospitalized for respiratory complications in the first year reduced by more than half in the treatment arm versus the sham arm,\" Slebos said in a meeting news release. </p><p>The study team reported that no patients died. Among those receiving TLD, five patients experienced side effects that included nausea, abdominal bloating and digestion discomfort. These problems were short-lived and gone within six months.</p><p>According to Horovitz, the invasive nature of the procedure may not make TLD appropriate for all COPD patients. \"This procedure would be contemplated in patients who are very symptomatic with shortness of breath and frequent exacerbations,\" he said.</p><p>A much larger, phase 3 trial is being planned for 2019, the researchers said.</p><p>Experts note that research presented at medical meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more about COPD, visit the <a href=\"http://www.lung.org/lung-health-and-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/copd/learn-about-copd/\" target=\"_new\"> American Lung Association</a>.</p>",

Spindle is a postdoctoral research fellow at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, in Baltimore.</p><p>These vaporizers aren't to be confused with \"vaping\" -- a term used to describe electronic cigarettes. </p><p>Survey data has shown that vaporizing is becoming a more popular method of using pot, particularly in states that have legalized recreational use of the drug, Spindle said.</p><p>\"It heats it to a temperature that doesn't reach combustion,\" Spindle said of the vaporizing devices. \"If you look at the cannabis after it's done vaporizing, it doesn't turn into the black ash material it would when you smoke it. It looks exactly like it did when you put it in.\"</p><p>To see if vaporizers deliver a different high than smoking pot, Spindle and his colleagues recruited 17 healthy adults who were not frequent marijuana users and asked them to both smoke pot from a pipe and inhale the fumes produced by a vaporizer.</p><p>The same 25-milligram dose of pot produced a significantly stronger high when vaporized than when smoked, the findings showed. Pre-rolled joints sold at dispensaries typically contain 1 gram of pot.</p><p>People on vaporized pot also showed greater impairment than when they smoked the drug, based on testing that gauges the ability to think, reason and perform fine motor skills.</p><p>Vaporized pot came with more side effects as well, including heart racing (24 percent versus 18 percent for smoked), paranoia (17 percent versus 10 percent), hunger (38 percent versus 33 percent), dry mouth (67 percent versus 43 percent), and red eyes (25 percent versus 16 percent).</p><p>Blood tests revealed that people had much higher levels of THC in their circulation after using a vaporizer, about 14.4 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood compared with 10.2 ng/mL when they smoked pot.</p><p>The effects typically wore off between six to eight hours for both vaporized and smoked pot, the researchers said.</p><p>Heating but not burning pot appears to ensure that more of the weed's high-producing chemicals are imbibed by the user, Spindle said.</p><p>\"Our theory is that when you combust cannabis, more of the THC is lost due to the combustion process,\" Spindle said. \"The vaporizer is a more efficient delivery method than the smoked cannabis.\"</p><p>People who don't use marijuana regularly should approach vaporizers with caution, said Nadia Solowij, a professor at the University of Wollongong in Australia.</p><p>\"There is a perception that it is a safer route given that it avoids burning the plant matter, thus reducing toxins formed by that process,\" said Solowij, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study. \"These findings raise concerns for inexperienced users, which include those using [pot] both recreationally but also trying cannabis for medical reasons,\" she added.</p><p>\"It may be wise to use a smaller amount of cannabis in a vaporizer to achieve the desired effect,\" Solowij concluded.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/marijuana/health-effects.html\" target=\"_new\">health effects of marijuana</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Dec. 4, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- If your belly is full from a delicious holiday feast but there's one more sweet left on the dessert tray, will you hold back or yield to temptation?</p><p>New research suggests that you'll give in, driven by a widely shared attitude towards food that prompts you to \"clean the plate,\" even if you're not really still hungry.</p><p>It's a form of \"consumption closure,\" nutritionists say. But over time it makes keeping the waistline trim an uphill battle.</p><p>\"The concept of a clean plate has many roots,\" noted Connie Diekman, director of university nutrition at Washington University in St. Louis. \"The starving children of the world, the lack of food during WWI or II and, of course, the fact that many people do not notice feelings of satiety and eat until the food is gone.\"</p><p>And while \"what drives an individual to 'clean their plate' might be very individual, the concern is global,\" she added. \"Overeating is a component of our growing problem of overweight.\"</p><p>That thought was seconded by Lona Sandon, program director of the department of clinical nutrition in the school of health professions at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. \"These extra bites may lead to weight gain or hinder weight-loss attempts,\" she agreed.</p><p>\"Those of us in the nutrition and dietetics business are well aware of the 'clean plate' mentality,\" Sandon said. \"And this is something I would often talk about when working with people wanting to lose weight -- getting people to accept that they do not have to eat everything on their plate,  that it is OK to throw it in the trash, and that those few extra bites after you are already full have calories that can add up.\"</p><p>Still, new research suggests that it's really only when a little food is left on the plate that the \"clean-the-plate\" phenomenon kicks in; a plate still piled high with sweets appears to be far easier to resist.</p><p>In a series of four experiments, scientists led by Veronika Ilyuk of Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., repeatedly found that a single item left on the plate exerted a much stronger end-of-meal pull than multiple items, whether it be chocolate-covered almonds, cookies or pizza.</p><p>And the research team further found that people often choose to believe the unbelievable: that last cookie is actually good for them.</p><p>No matter that the two inches of sugary icing on top of a  1,000-calorie cupcake suggests otherwise; part of the \"clean-the-plate\" phenomenon is telling yourself the white lie that one more bite is not really the scale-buster that a silly calorie table might suggest.</p><p>As to what's driving the plate-cleaning urge to begin with, Sandon believes that the overriding impetus behind the \"cleaning-the-plate\" ethos is more about indulging than any broad biological survival imperative.</p><p>\"Such foods are highly palatable and can drive the desire to eat,\" she said, particularly when it comes to items that are high in fat, sugar or salt.</p><p>And that, said Sandon, means that a \"strategy to combat this may be to eat foods with less fat, added sugar and salt. You rarely hear people say I just need to eat that extra bite of broccoli but I am so stuffed. But they will do it with the chocolate cake.\"</p><p> Diekman suggested that \"slowing down your eating also helps. It takes time to feel satisfied and fast eaters miss that feeling.\" </p><p>Another strategy, according to Sandon, \"is to start with smaller serving sizes at meal and snack times. Simply put less on the plate to start. But again, this takes self-regulation. Using portion-controlled packages or containers may help with this as well.\"</p><p>But, she added, \"awareness and mindfulness may be the best strategy. Taking a moment to notice your thoughts and what you are telling yourself when you are tempted to take that last bite despite feeling full.\"</p><p>The report will be published in the February issue of the journal <i>Appetite</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on healthy holiday foods at the <a href=\"https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2016/11/healthy-holiday-foods-fun\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institutes of Health</a>.</p>",

According to results of this study, the drug's effects peak as early as seven days after treatment -- much earlier than previously seen in other studies.</p><p>Moreover, patients who had a year of this immunotherapy treatment after surgery were free of their cancer for more than two years, the longest follow-up so far on patients with melanoma. </p><p>\"Anti-PD-1 works extremely rapidly, achieving immunological responses peaking in most patients within one to three weeks,\" said study co-author John Wherry. He's director of the Penn Institute for Immunology at the University of Pennsylvania. </p><p>About a third of the patients were \"essentially cured within three weeks, highlighting the rapidity of immunotherapy for cancer,\" Wherry said.</p><p>And in those patients whose cancer returned, researchers found revealing patterns in the way cancer adapts to the drug -- discoveries that could lead to better ways to treat such patients.</p><p>Keytruda is the drug responsible for the remission of former President Jimmy Carter's cancer in 2015. Carter, then 90, had melanoma that spread to his brain and liver. Treatment with Keytruda appears to have cured him.</p><p>The drug isn't cheap, costing about $150,000 a year. Keytruda is covered by most insurance, including Medicare, but copays can be high, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p><p>For the study, researchers gave 27 patients with advanced melanoma a single dose of Keytruda three weeks before surgery. </p><p>Eight patients had what researchers described as a complete response, meaning less than 10 percent of the cancer cells remained at the time of surgery. All eight remained cancer-free for up to 25 months of follow-up. </p><p>Researchers also investigated how tumor cells in patients whose cancer returned were able to develop a resistance to Keytruda. The investigators found two causes -- tumor mutations and increased activity of cells that naturally suppress the immune system. </p><p>Knowing the factors that cause a lack of response to the drug may help to identify patients who might benefit from other therapies in combination with PD-1, Wherry said. </p><p>Dr. Steven Savona, a physician at Northwell Health's Monter Cancer Center in Lake Success, N.Y., was not involved with the study, but reviewed the findings. He said the fast-acting immune response offers a new approach to a disease that used to be approachable only with surgery. </p><p>Savona said it could make the surgery simpler, and if used in combination with other treatments, surgery might not even be necessary for some patients. </p><p>\"This might be a new approach for patients with limited but advanced melanoma, but we do need additional testing to prove that,\" said Savona.</p><p>Merck, Inc., maker of Keytruda, supplied the drug for the study but did not fund the trial.</p><p>Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that more than 96,000 new melanomas will be diagnosed in the United States this year, and 7,200 people will die from the disease. </p><p>Standard treatment includes surgery followed by a year of drug treatment in high-risk patients. </p><p>The report was published Feb. 25 in the journal <i>Nature Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Cancer Society offers more facts about <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/melanoma-skin-cancer.html/\" target=\"_new\">melanoma</a>.</p>",

It affects millions of people worldwide and puts them at higher risk for stroke and, in rare cases, can lead to heart failure.</p><p>This study included 716 middle-aged men and women in Finland who were followed for an average of 19 years. During that time, 74 of the participants were diagnosed with atrial fibrillation.</p><p>Those with the highest levels of salt in their diet had a higher rate of atrial fibrillation than those with the lowest salt intake. After accounting for several other risk factors -- including age, body fat, blood pressure and smoking -- the researchers found that salt consumption was independently associated with the risk of atrial fibrillation. </p><p>But the study only found an association -- it did not prove that a high-salt diet causes the heart rhythm disorder.</p><p>The study was published recently in the <i>Annals of Medicine</i>.</p><p>\"This study provides the first evidence that dietary salt may increase the risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation, adding to a growing list of dangers from excessive salt consumption on our cardiovascular health,\" said study author Tero Paakko, from the University of Oulu in Finland.</p><p>\"Although further confirmatory studies are needed, our results suggest that people who are at an increased risk of atrial fibrillation may benefit from restricting salt in their diet,\" Paakko said in a journal news release.</p><p>The chances of developing atrial fibrillation increase with age, and the condition affects about 7 in 100 people  65 and older.</p><p>\"With estimates suggesting that over three-quarters of salt consumed is already added in processed foods, reducing salt intake at a population level could have a hugely beneficial impact on new-onset atrial fibrillation and overall cardiovascular disease,\" Paakko said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has more on <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/atrial-fibrillation\" target=\"_new\">atrial fibrillation</a>.</p>",

Kickstarting with the Whole30 diet may be a good choice, a  dietitian suggests.</p><p>But you have to be careful when you start a diet that restricts foods. These diets can be risky, according to Ohio State's Lori Chong, a certified diabetes educator.</p><p>The Whole30 program is only supposed to be used for 30 days. The diet requires you to cut out added sugar (real or artificial), alcohol, grains (including quinoa, corn and rice), legumes, dairy and carrageenan, MSG and sulfites, which are found in many processed foods.</p><p>\"Eating whole, unprocessed foods and making an effort to consume plenty of fruits and vegetables is a great goal for anyone,\" Chong said. So is cutting out sugar, she added.</p><p>Many people will lose weight on a diet like Whole30, but weight loss isn't the only goal. The diet can also help if you are at risk for diabetes, and help with conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome.</p><p>But after a 30-day wonder diet like Whole30, it's likely weight will return if you don't follow a few rules. Keeping the weight off is a matter of adding foods back into your diet with moderation and balance.</p><p>\"However, in my experience as a dietitian, most people have difficulty maintaining that balance when they go off a restrictive diet. The restrictive phase is often so restrictive that rebound overeating occurs,\" Chong explained in a university news release.</p><p>Moreover, these diets aren't for people with a history of eating disorders, pregnant women or frail folks.</p><p>These diets are great, however, for people who are willing to put in the time and effort to shop, cook and make healthy food choices.</p><p>Tips to keeping the weight off after your 30-day program include:</p><ul><li>Reintroduce foods one at a time and in small amounts. Don't go crazy with sugar. Reintroduce it slowly and keep amounts small.</li><li>Stick to whole grains -- don't use white flour products. </li> <li>Slowly reintroduce dairy, with foods like unsweetened or plain yogurt, and keep cheese to a minimum. </li><li>Stick to moderate drinking -- up to one drink a day for women, up to two drinks for men.</li><li>Add legumes (beans, lentils, peas, etc.) back to your usual diet. Legumes are nutrient-dense and high in fiber. Eat them every day.</li></ul><p>\"Every small step toward eating more vegetables and other whole foods  -- as well as fewer sugary and processed foods -- is a step in the right direction,\" Chong said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on healthy eating, visit the <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/eat-healthy/how-to-eat-healthy/index.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a>.</p>",

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration  approved Epidiolex for treatment of two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome.</p><p>Epidiolex, a twice-daily oral solution, is the first FDA-approved drug to contain an ingredient derived from the marijuana plant. CBD does not produce a high; that's caused by another compound in pot called THC.</p><p>To see how well CBD works in treating epilepsy, researchers recruited 92 children and adults whose seizures were not responding to other medications. All had used CBD for an average of nearly 20 months.</p><p>In this new study, CBD was used in a broader pool of patients, ranging from those with Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet to people with epilepsy caused by stroke.</p><p>About 57 percent saw their monthly seizure frequency cut in half while taking CBD, indicating that the treatment is effective.</p><p>But tolerance developed in about one-third of those patients after an average of seven months. Doctors needed to increase the dose by 30 percent to get the same benefit; otherwise, the seizures increased by more than 30 percent on the same dose, the findings showed.</p><p>Doctors increased the dose of CBD for all patients who developed tolerance, and 12 people responded well while 15 did not.</p><p>About one-third of patients stopped taking CBD due to lack of effectiveness or because of side effects, which included sleepiness and gastrointestinal issues, such as nausea, decreased appetite and vomiting, the researchers reported.</p><p>These results indicate that CBD is a valuable new epilepsy drug, but is not a magic bullet for treating seizures, epilepsy experts said.</p><p>\"We often talk about a honeymoon period when patients start a new medication. Many of those patients then relapse,\" said Dr. Fred Lado, Northwell Health's regional director of epilepsy for Queens and Long Island in New York. \"In this study, tolerance decreased after about seven months, which is similar to the honeymoon period we see with other medications.\"</p><p>Dr. Shlomo Shinnar, president of the American Epilepsy Society, agreed that epilepsy drugs tend to lose some effectiveness in patients over time.</p><p>\"This is not really a big shock: All the drugs we have and use, even when they work, a year later we're frequently moving on to the next drug,\" said Shinnar, director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Management Center at the Montefiore Medical Center and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. </p><p>\"This study should temper one's enthusiasm but it should not eliminate one's enthusiasm,\" he added. \"It's still a good drug. I intend to be using it in my patients.\"</p><p>There was hope that CBD might have been different from other epilepsy drugs, since the substance promotes increased activity in cannabinoid receptors in the brain, said Dr. Ruben Kuzniecky, director of research and clinical trials at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>Given that, it would have made sense that increases in tolerance would have been limited, he noted.</p><p>\"This is an important observation given the long-term data,\" Kuzniecky said. \"CBD is a welcome addition to the treatment of certain forms of epilepsy, but long-term use and larger populations will be needed to understand its limitations.\"</p><p>Research presented at meetings is typically considered preliminary until it is published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has more about <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm611046.htm\" target=\"_new\">Epidiolex</a>.</p>",

That's why the new report is so important, he said.</p><p>\"The use of deceased donors could greatly broaden access to this treatment, and our results provide proof-of-concept for a new option for women with uterine infertility,\" Ejzenberg said in a journal news release.</p><p>There have been 10 other uterus transplants from deceased donors performed in the United States, the Czech Republic and Turkey, but this one in Brazil is the first to result in a live birth.</p><p>One U.S. fertility expert said the success in this case really could be a breakthrough.</p><p>\"Up to 15 percent of couples suffer from infertility and every year thousands of women are using gestational carriers in order to conceive,\" said Dr. Tomer Singer, who directs reproductive endocrinology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>\"Uterine transplantation can help many couples in achieving their dream of parenthood,\" he said, and \"using a uterus from a deceased organ donor increases the number of donors available significantly.\"</p><p>It also \"eliminates the main challenge,\" Singer added, \"which is finding a matching donor and risking the lives of live donors who have to otherwise undergo a major surgery to remove their uterus.\"</p><p>As Ejzenberg's team reported, the recipient in this case was a 32-year-old woman who was born without a uterus, and the donor was a 45-year-old woman who died of a stroke.</p><p>The 10.5-hour transplant surgery took place in September of 2016.</p><p>The recipient received five immunosuppression drugs (needed to prevent rejection of the new uterus by the body), antibiotics, anti-blood clotting treatment and aspirin while in hospital. Immunosuppression therapy continued after she left the hospital until the time of her baby's birth.</p><p>Before the transplant, the woman underwent in vitro fertilization, resulting in eight fertilized eggs that were frozen. Implantation of the eggs occurred seven months after the transplant, the researchers said.</p><p>Pregnancy was confirmed 10 days after implantation. The only complication during pregnancy was a kidney infection, which was treated with antibiotics. The baby girl was born at 35 weeks and three days.</p><p>The transplanted uterus was also removed during the cesarean section and showed no anomalies, the doctors noted.</p><p>The mother and baby were discharged from the hospital three days after birth. At the age of 7 months and 20 days, the baby continued to breastfeed and weighed 15 pounds, 14 ounces.</p><p>According to data included in the new report, among infertile couples, one in 500 have uterine infertility due to factors such as birth defects, hysterectomy or infection.</p><p>Singer noted that the first childbirth to a woman who received a uterus transplant from a live donor occurred in Sweden in 2013. There have so far been a total of 39 such procedures, resulting in 11 live births.</p><p>In these cases, the donor was \"usually a family member,\" he said.</p><p>Singer stressed that pregnancies involving transplanted uteruses from deceased donors have failed in the past, but the Brazilian case is \"an exciting step in the right direction.\"</p><p>Still, women who do carry a baby using this technique face challenges, he added.</p><p>These include the need to use several immune-suppressing drugs  throughout the 9 months of pregnancy, which may have side effects on both the mom and the baby; having to deliver the baby and then remove the uterus in a cesarean hysterectomy procedure; a high rate of organ rejection; and a lengthy surgery that requires a multi-disciplinary approach among doctors.</p><p>Furthermore, \"more research is needed for long-term outcome assessment for both the uterine recipient and the newborns,\" Singer concluded.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Office on Women's Health has more on <a href=\"https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/infertility\" target=\"_new\">female infertility</a>.</p>",

His team developed and implemented a new program to help keep those lifestyle changes on track.</p><p>The  findings were scheduled for presentation on Thursday at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.</p><p>In the study, Janni's team tracked outcomes for nearly 2,300 early stage breast cancer patients who'd been treated with chemotherapy. Half of these cancer survivors were randomly assigned to two years of ongoing telephone-based, personalized healthy living advice. The other half (the \"control\" group) received standard, general advice on a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>Those in the personalized lifestyle intervention group were coached in areas such as improving their diet, reducing fat intake, and increasing physical activity.</p><p>After two years, people in the intervention group saw an average weight loss of 2.2 pounds, while those in the control group experienced an average weight <i>gain</i> of 2.1 pounds, the findings showed.</p><p>But the real difference was in cancer outcomes, Janni's team said. The rate of disease-free survival among the nearly 1,500 patients who completed the lifestyle intervention was 35 percent higher than that of those who didn't complete the program. And it was 50 percent higher than women who didn't get the intervention at all.</p><p>The findings shouldn't come as a big surprise, Janni said.</p><p>Prior research \"has shown that obesity and low physical activity are associated with higher risks of developing breast cancer, as well as an increased risk of recurrence and reduced survival,\" he noted in a meeting news release.</p><p>One U.S. expert agreed.</p><p>Many women who've survived breast cancer may feel helpless, but \"it is great to be able to tell patients that, yes, there is something they can do to help prevent a recurrence,\" said Dr. Alice Police. She is regional director of breast surgery at the Northwell Health Cancer Institute, in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y.</p><p>She said sometimes women need a little nudge, though, to stay healthy.</p><p>\"This is a very specific and focused look at the issues and includes information on exactly how a program of diet and lifestyle changes should look and function,\" Police said, \"and that makes it very important.\"</p><p>Dr. Lauren Cassell is chief of breast surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. Looking over the new study, she agreed that the new program appears to have merit.</p><p>\"By providing the patient with a systematic telephone lifestyle intervention program --  which was not difficult to develop and implement --  they were able to increase patient compliance and as a result improve outcomes,\" Cassell said.</p><p>\"I believe patients want to help themselves,\" Cassell said. \"Sometimes they just need a little extra support.\"</p><p>Because the findings were presented at a medical meeting, they should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Cancer Society has more on <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/living-as-a-breast-cancer-survivor/can-i-lower-my-risk-of-breast-cancer-progressing-or-coming-back.html\" target=\"_new\">lowering the risk of breast cancer progression or return</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 6, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Gavin Kuykendall's life has been shaped by his fight against heart disease. Now almost 12, he recently expressed all he's been through -- by writing a letter to his heart disease.</p> <p>\"You made my parents very sad,\" he said, reading his letter in a video. \"You tried to make my birthday an overwhelming and unhappy day. Even though you made me incredibly sick, I was brave, I was strong.\"</p> <p>Like all first-time parents-to-be, Faith and Adam Kuykendall were looking forward to their 20-week ultrasound and the chance to take another peek at their unborn child. </p> <p>\"Everything was going great until the doctor got to the heart,\" Faith said. \"You could just see his face drop and he said, 'Oh no.' \"</p> <p>Tests showed their son had a rare condition in which the left ventricle doesn't develop properly. It's called hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). The left ventricle is responsible for pumping freshly oxygenated blood out to the rest of the body.</p> <p>Without immediate intervention, HLHS is fatal, usually within days or weeks.</p> <p>Such specialized care wasn't available in their hometown of Tulsa. Their frequent medical appointments and the delivery would need to be in Oklahoma City, nearly two hours away.</p> <p>Gavin arrived after 28 hours of labor. Although Faith and Adam had been warned they could see a child \"blue and limp or not breathing,\" he came out screaming -- a great sign.</p> <p>Four days later, Gavin underwent open-heart surgery to create a way for the right ventricle to pump blood to both the lungs and the body. Doctors implanted a shunt that directs blood to the lungs.</p> <p>Doctors left the incision open for a few days until the swelling subsided.</p> <p>\"That was the worst,\" Faith said. \"He was naked and swollen. You could literally see his heart beating in his chest.\"</p> <p>Gavin remained in the hospital for a month. Four months later, it was time for a second procedure.</p> <p>Typically, this one is easier on the child. But Gavin \"wasn't eating, his left side wasn't functioning, and he was shaking,\" Faith said.</p> <p>Doctors discovered that not only had Gavin suffered a stroke during surgery, he'd become addicted to the powerful narcotics he'd been given. He was going through withdrawal, for which he was treated with methadone.</p> <p>Those first few years were tough for the Kuykendalls. Family, their church community and others in their support system helped them persevere, providing meals and ensuring that someone was always with Gavin. </p> <p>\"We even had a family CPR class so everyone would know what to do, just in case,\" Faith said.</p> <p>Their network came through again in 2009, when it was time for a third surgery.</p> <p>The surgeon who'd cared for Gavin had left Oklahoma for San Diego, leaving their home state without anyone capable of performing the operation. </p> <p>Friends and family helped raise the needed funds to travel to San Diego to stay with the same doctor. And all went well. At 2 1/2, Gavin's heart was rebuilt to the best of expectations. A few months later, Gavin became a big brother. Brody was born, thankfully with a well-formed heart. </p> <p>\"That kid is a walking comedian,\" Faith said. \"I think God knew we needed that.\"</p> <p>Gavin was 5 1/2 when he began facing more complications. Doctors determined he needed a pacemaker to help his heart beat in a regular rhythm. The family again returned to San Diego for the surgery.</p> <p>Around the same time, a close friend of the Kuykendalls -- Brandon Weeden -- was selected in the first round of the National Football League draft. Brandon's wife, Melanie, and Adam had worked together just out of college, and the couples had become close friends.  </p> <p>The Weedens were disappointed to learn that the state of Oklahoma lacked the specialists to operate on Gavin and other children. So after signing his NFL contract, Weeden started a foundation, which in turn helped establish a cardiac surgery research program at The Children's Hospital in Oklahoma City.</p> <p>\"I have so much respect for Gavin and the whole family,\" said Weeden, who now plays for the Houston Texans. \"He's already been through more in his lifetime than I'll ever go through. We have birthdays a day apart and try to celebrate together. I just think the world of him.\"</p> <p>Gavin is now in sixth grade and plays right field on his baseball team. Although he also loves football, he's not allowed to play contact sports. </p> <p>\"Of course he wants to do what all the other boys are doing, and that's a struggle,\" Faith said. \"Although he has some anxieties, and some physical and intellectual limitations, I don't want him to think that heart disease defines him. Luckily, he is the most determined, strong-willed child.\"</p> <p>Gavin said he's particularly proud of inspiring Weeden's foundation to help other children in Oklahoma. </p> <p>\"I want people to know that no matter what you have, or what you feel like, you're not alone,\" Gavin said. \"You can do this.\"</p>",

If you're more able to be physically active, you're more able to be sexually active,\" said Boothby, a research assistant in the department of community health sciences.</p><p>However, the researchers did not find any strong link between cardiac rehab and sexual satisfaction.</p><p>Cardiac rehabilitation is a medically supervised program designed to improve the heart health of people who've had a heart attack or heart failure, or have undergone angioplasty or heart surgery, according to the American Heart Association.</p><p>Rehab involves exercise counseling and training to improve fitness, education on heart-healthy living, and counseling to reduce stress.</p><p>For this review, Boothby and her colleagues pored through medical literature and found 14 studies that evaluated cardiac rehab's potential effect on a person's sex life.</p><p>Of six studies pertaining specifically to sexual function, three showed improvement after cardiac rehab and two showed mixed results, the researchers found. Only one showed worsened function following rehab.</p><p>Study results also showed that people tend to have sex more often after attending cardiac rehabilitation, compared with those who don't take part in the program.</p><p>Most of the research focused on men, Boothby said. But it could be expected that women would benefit similarly from cardiac rehabilitation.</p><p>\"There is just a lack of research being conducted on females right now for this whole topic,\" Boothby said.</p><p>There are three ways heart disease can impact sexuality, the researchers explained.</p><p>For one, physical limitations -- like fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, erectile dysfunction and vaginal dryness -- are common among people recovering from a heart problem.</p><p>In addition, blood pressure drugs have been associated with sexual dysfunction in men and decreased sexual response in women.</p><p>Finally, feelings of anxiety, fear and depression are common in heart disease patients, increasing apprehension around sex.</p><p>These problems can become a \"vicious circle that is hard to break,\" said Dr. Claudio Gil Soares de Araujo, director of research and education for the Exercise Medicine Clinic (CLINIMEX) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p><p>\"Regularly attending a cardiac rehabilitation program that will help to lose body fat, to gain muscles, to become more flexible, and to improve balance and the capacity to tolerate higher exercise intensity for longer periods of time is perhaps one of the best ways to help the sexual life of a man or woman with heart disease,\" said Araujo, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.</p><p>The positive benefits appear to stem largely from the exercise portion of cardiac rehab. There was no clear association between sexual activity and rehab programs that included psychological counseling, the findings showed.</p><p>Sex is on the minds of many people with heart problems, Boothby said, and their concerns aren't likely to be addressed while they're in the hospital or preparing to leave for home.</p><p>\"Sometimes discharge is very hectic. Patients are often getting a lot of information about their medications and physical activity, and then they're discharged,\" she said. \"That's not necessarily the best place to receive that information.\"</p><p>Previous research has shown that couples are very open to receiving sexual activity support within a cardiac rehabilitation program, Boothby added.</p><p>However, more study needs to be done on sex during recovery, she suggested, as there are still gaps in knowledge.</p><p>\"Sexual activity is very important to overall quality of life, and heart patients are living longer with cardiovascular disease than they ever were before,\" Boothby said. \"It's important to be addressing the non-clinical aspects of heart disease just as much as the clinical aspects.\"</p><p>The new evidence review was published Dec. 6 in the  <i>Canadian Journal of Cardiology</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart Association has more about <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cardiac-rehab/what-is-cardiac-rehabilitation\" target=\"_new\">cardiac rehabilitation</a>.</p>",

By comparison, the latest survey looked at a far wider age range, and is the first such effort to be national in scope.</p><p>The latest figure is also based on a more recent time frame than the CDC's last review in 2014, he noted. And his team's conclusions stem from information collected from parents, while the CDC conducted a review of medical and school records.</p><p>\"I don't know if 'surprised' is the word I would use,\" Kogan said about his team's findings. \"We began the study knowing that the prevalence of ASD had been increasing for the last 30 to 40 years.\"</p><p>Kogan serves as director of the Office of Epidemiology and Research in the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration.</p><p>Apart from arriving at an estimate for autism prevalence, the investigators noted that more than a quarter of children with ASD (27 percent) were taking some type of medication to tackle the disorder's symptoms. Nearly two-thirds (64 percent) had been receiving behavioral treatment in the year leading up to the survey.</p><p>But parents of children with autism indicated that their children had greater care needs -- and had more trouble getting that care -- relative to those struggling with other comparable conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression and anxiety, Down syndrome, behavioral or conduct problems, intellectual or learning disabilities, and/or Tourette syndrome.</p> <p>Specifically, parents said they were 44 percent more likely to have trouble getting mental health care, 24 percent less likely to get care coordination help, and 23 percent less likely to have a \"medical home\" for their child, meaning a single team of caregivers.</p><p>The findings were published online Nov. 26 in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i>.</p><p>Thomas Frazier, chief science officer at Autism Speaks, expressed little surprise at the findings.</p><p>\"They are generally consistent with previous parent surveys and other direct prevalence studies where researchers directly screen for and attempt to identify autism,\" he said, adding that the CDC numbers are \"probably a bit conservative.\"</p><p>As to why estimates have generally been rising in recent years, Frazier dismissed the idea that the overall share of American children who have autism is growing that rapidly, suggesting instead that analysis methods have become \"more liberal and inclusive.\"</p><p>As to the broader question of access to care, Frazier agreed that there is an urgent need to provide better access to early screening and subsequent treatment, particularly for low-income families.</p><p>\"At Autism Speaks, we have attempted through our Autism Treatment Network to increase pediatricians' and family practice doctors' awareness and ability to screen,\" in addition to providing \"gold-standard\" medical care, he said.</p><p>And Frazier added that \"early, intensive developmental and behavioral interventions are effective,\" especially when parents get the training they need to be better positioned to help their child.</p><p>According to Autism Speaks, autism spectrum disorder refers to a \"broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on accessing autism care at <a href=\"https://www.autismspeaks.org/autism-treatment-network-atn\" target=\"_new\">Autism Speaks</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 27, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- There isn't much news about this flu season yet, and the headlines about last year's terrible toll have faded.</p> <p>But don't stop paying attention to the annual health menace, and what nearly everyone needs to do about it: Get a flu shot.</p> <p>\"It's still early in the season,\" said Dr. Trish Perl, chief of infectious diseases at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. \"But there have been some flu deaths reported already, which is always concerning to us.\"</p> <p>Last year caused great concern.</p> <p>At a news conference in late September kicking off the vaccination drive, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said that a particularly fierce strain of the flu virus and vaccination rates that declined in some age groups \"combined to make it a particularly bad flu season.\"</p> <p>In a recent weekly report, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said flu activity around the country remained low. But that is not unusual. Peak flu season can range from December to March, with February the most common peak month.</p> <p>However, health experts recommend that anyone over the age of 6 months get a flu shot by November at the latest because the vaccine takes two weeks to become effective. Perl said that discrepancy -- urging people to get shots before the flu has become a problem -- might dilute the message's effectiveness.</p> <p>\"Flu is something people have been a little blas&eacute; about,\" she said. \"They don't understand it's a disease that kills a lot of people. This isn't just something that puts you in bed for a couple of days. It increases your risks of heart attack, of hospitalization and of death.\"</p> <p>The flu is estimated to cause between 12,000 and 56,000 deaths and up to 710,000 hospitalizations in the U.S. each year.</p> <p>Flu has always taken its biggest toll among older people and those with underlying illnesses. A study published earlier this year in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> confirmed longstanding suspicions that the flu is linked to heart attacks.</p> <p>The Canadian study analyzing five years of data showed that people over 35 who caught the flu had a six times greater chance of suffering a heart attack in the week following their diagnosis.</p> <p>\"Infections put a big toll on your heart,\" said Dr. Jennifer Robinson, a cardiologist and professor of epidemiology at the University of Iowa's Carver College of Medicine. \"It has to pump more and people with heart failure can't keep up. Infection can cause you to have an inflammation and a plaque rupture, which can cause a heart attack or stroke.\"</p> <p>As usual, the recommendations to get a flu shot come with asterisks: There's no way to know how bad a flu season will be, and the vaccine prepared months in advance doesn't always target every strain of flu virus that actually hits. You still might get the flu, although it will likely be less severe. And yes, your shoulder may get a little sore, but the vaccine does not cause the flu.</p> <p>None of that is a good excuse to go unvaccinated, Robinson said. \"The older you get, the harder it is to fight off infections,\" she said. \"And for anyone who has chronic diseases, the flu can tip people over and cause complications. So why take a chance?\"</p> <p>The surgeon general was more blunt.</p> <p>\"I'm tired of hearing people say, 'Well, I didn't get sick and I didn't get the flu shot.' Or, 'I don't like it, my arm hurts,' \" Adams said. \"Getting the flu shot isn't just about keeping you safe. Getting the flu shot is about community, about everyone else around you.\"</p> <p>Because the virus is so contagious, people who are vaccinated help protect those who aren't, he said.</p> <p>No matter how bad the upcoming flu season turns out, Robinson said to think of the vaccine as the perfect holiday gift for your family.</p> <p>\"The weather dries out, we all get together for the holidays and we spread our germs,\" she said. \"So, get protection.\"</p>",

Your heart may love it, too.</p><p>New research from sauna-loving Finland suggests that for people aged 50 and older, saunas may lower their odds of risk of dying from heart disease.</p><p>Specifically, just 5 percent of Finns in the study who spent more than 45 minutes in a sauna each week died of heart disease over the 15-year study period, compared to 10 percent of those who spent less that 15 minutes a week in saunas, the researchers said.</p><p>Of course, the study couldn't prove cause-and-effect --  it's possible that sauna-loving folk have other heart-healthy habits that might explain the findings.</p><p>Still, \"there are several possible reasons why sauna use may decrease the risk of death due to cardiovascular disease,\" said study co-author Dr. Jari Laukkanen, head of cardiology at the University of Eastern Finland. His team published its findings Nov. 28 in the journal <i>BMC Medicine</i>.</p><p>\"Our research team has shown in previous studies that high sauna use is associated with lower blood pressure,\" he noted in a journal news release. \"Additionally, sauna use is known to trigger an increase in heart rate equal to that seen in low- to moderate-intensity physical exercise.\"</p><p>One U.S. expert who looked over the findings agreed that heat can often be therapeutic to the human body, but the sauna experience might differ a bit in America.</p><p>\"The greatest benefit [in the study] was observed in individuals who took 4-7 saunas per week, a frequency that Americans are unlikely to achieve,\" noted Dr. Cindy Grines, who directs cardiology at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y.</p><p>\"In addition, this study used dry heat, and whether the results are similar with steam baths or hot tubs is not known,\" she said.</p><p>Laukkanen's team agreed that because the data came from one area in Finland, the findings might not apply to other populations.</p><p>The study relied on data from nearly 1,700 Finnish men and women. Participants were asked about their use of saunas, and these data were compared with deaths from cardiovascular disease. Data for the study were collected between 1998 and 2015 and the average follow-up was 15 years.</p><p>Frequency of sauna use did seem tied to heart health. Among people who used a sauna four to seven times a week, 3 percent died from heart disease over 15 years, but that number rose to 10 percent for those who used the sauna just once a week, the study found.</p><p>Dr. David Friedman is chief of heart failure services at Long Island Jewish Valley Stream Hospital in Valley Stream, N.Y. He said that it's tough to draw firm conclusions from the study, but the findings suggest that sauna use \"could be a helpful additional strategy\" for heart health, along with improved diet and more exercise.</p><p>But another cardiologist stressed that Americans shouldn't begin think of saunas as substitutes for exercise.</p><p>\"Moderate to high intensity exercise has a cardioprotective effect,\" explained Dr. Satjit Bhusri, who practices at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. The new findings don't necessarily mean that \"everyone should spend the day at the spa [instead],\" he said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more information on cardiovascular disease , visit the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/consumer-healthcare/what-is-cardiovascular-disease\" target=\"_new\"> American Heart Association</a>.</p>",

None had used opioids in the 180 days before delivery.</p><p>After delivery, 89 percent who had a cesarean delivery and 53 percent who had a vaginal delivery filled opioid prescriptions.</p><p>The overall rate of persistent opioid use in the year after delivery was low overall -- less than 1 percent.

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Dec. 11, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Women often delay calling for emergency help when heart attack symptoms start, a new study finds.</p><p>Researchers in Switzerland found that women suffering a heart attack typically waited 37 minutes longer than men before calling an ambulance. And those delays showed no signs of improving over the 16-year study period.</p><p>One reason may be the persistent myth that heart attacks are a \"man's disease,\" said lead researcher Dr. Matthias Meyer, a cardiologist at Triemli Hospital, in Zurich.</p><p>In addition, he said, women are more likely than men to suffer lesser-known heart symptoms, like pain in the back, shoulder or stomach. That means many women -- and the people who witness their symptoms -- may not immediately realize they should call for help, Meyer said.</p><p>Yet, the study found, even when women had the \"classic\" heart attack symptom of chest pain, they often hesitated to call for help.</p><p>And while the findings come from Switzerland, a similar pattern has been seen in other countries, too, according to Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a spokesperson for the American Heart Association (AHA).</p><p>Steinbaum pointed to a recent research review finding that, overall, women waited 30 percent longer than men to call for help.</p><p>\"That tells us this is a worldwide problem,\" said Steinbaum, who directs the women's cardiovascular prevention, health and wellness program at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.</p><p>She agreed with Meyer on the potential reasons, and also noted that many women are simply used to putting their families first, and their own health second. So even when they have symptoms like chest pain, she said,  women may often take a \"Let's see what happens\" attitude.</p><p>For the study, Meyer's team analyzed records from nearly 4,400 heart attack patients treated at their hospital between 2000 and 2016.</p><p>The good news: Over the years, ambulance crews and hospital staff got patients into treatment faster, and the improvement was equal for women and men.</p><p>The bad news: By 2016, women were still spending 41 minutes longer in \"ischemia\" -- a reduction in the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart. And that was largely due to delays in calling emergency services, the researchers found.</p><p>Heart attacks occur when a clot obstructs blood flow to the heart. The quicker doctors can restore that blood flow, the less damage there will be to the heart muscle.</p><p>\"There's a saying, 'Time is muscle,' \" Steinbaum said.</p><p>Over the years, the AHA and its counterparts in other countries have launched public campaigns to raise women's awareness of heart disease. Yet the new study found that women were waiting just as long to call for help in 2016 as they were in 2000.</p><p>In contrast, men were slightly quicker to seek help by the end of the study -- about 6 minutes, typically.</p><p> Meyer said it's not surprising that the delays among women failed to change, but it is disappointing.</p><p> Steinbaum added, \"We've clearly got more work to do. We've got to keep this conversation going.\"</p><p>According to the AHA, cardiovascular disease is the top killer of U.S. women, causing about one out of every three deaths.</p><p>As with men, chest pain is the most common heart attack symptom among women, the AHA says. But other symptoms include shortness of breath; pain in the back, jaw or stomach; and nausea or lightheadedness. And women are more likely than men to have those subtler problems.</p><p>\"If you have those symptoms, act on them,\" Steinbaum said. \"Call 911.\"</p><p>If it turns out you really have bad heartburn, she added, that's good -- you'll get to go home.</p><p>Sometimes, Steinbaum noted, people worry about \"bothering\" ER doctors and nurses with non-serious problems.</p><p>\"You're not bothering us,\" she said. \"That's our job.\"</p><p>The study was published online Dec. 11 in the <i>European Heart Journal: Acute Cardiovascular Care</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The AHA's Go Red For Women campaign has more on <a href=\"https://www.goredforwomen.org/\" target=\"_new\">women and heart disease</a>.</p>",

They included polypropylene used in bottle caps, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) used in drink bottles, polystyrene found in plastic utensils and cups, and polyethylene used in plastic bags and storage containers.</p><p>Schwabl said he found the data \"astonishing.\"</p><p>\"I believe that trying to reduce plastic usage and plastic-packed food might be beneficial for nature and for us,\" Schwabl said. \"Certainly, plastic is a very useful material and has a lot of clever applications. But maybe we should try to rethink about the necessity of abundant plastic use, and search for and support ecological and sustainable alternatives.\"</p><p>It's too soon to tell whether these plastic particles could harm people, Schwabl and other experts said.</p><p>\"We're seeing increasing evidence that it's in people. Now we need to think about how it will impact human health,\" said Dr. Kenneth Spaeth, chief of occupational and environmental medicine at Northwell Health in Great Neck, N.Y. \"We know that plastics contain an array of potentially harmful substances that in other contexts we know can leach out and potentially affect human health.\"</p><p>The new study follows a report last week that microplastics can be found in 90 percent of table salt. Salt samples from 21 countries in Europe, North and South America, Africa and Asia were analyzed; of 39 salt brands tested, 36 contained microplastics, the <i>National Geographic</i> reported.</p><p>For the stool study, Schwabl and his team recruited one test subject each from Finland, the Netherlands, Poland, Austria, Italy, the United Kingdom, Russia and Japan. The group consisted of three women and five men ranging in age from 33 to 65.</p><p>Each person kept a food diary during the week before they provided a stool sample. The diaries showed that all participants had consumed plastic-wrapped foods or drank from plastic bottles. Six had consumed ocean fish.</p><p>Lab tests found microplastic particles from 9 out of 10 plastic types, with sizes ranging from 50 to 500 microns. A human hair has a diameter of about 50 microns.</p><p>Other plastic types included polyoxymethylene (car parts and food industry), polycarbonate (construction and electronics), nylon (rope, fishing nets and textiles) and polyurethane (ship varnish, construction and auto parts).</p><p>There are a couple of ways these plastic particles could be winding up inside of people, Schwabl suggested.</p><p>Microplastics to wind up in food through plastic packaging, or could enter the food chain by being eaten by sea life, he said.</p><p>\"In our study, most participants drank liquids from plastic bottles, but also fish and seafood ingestion was common,\" Schwabl noted.</p><p>There are no human studies that show how microplastics might affect human health, Schwabl said. But animal studies have shown that microplastic particles are capable of entering the blood stream, lymphatic system and liver.</p><p>Inside the gut, the microplastics could cause intestinal damage or alter the shape of the villi that line the intestinal wall, said Dr. Arun Swaminath, director of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>There's also some concern regarding the endocrine-disrupting chemicals contained in these plastics, Spaeth said. Human studies have found that these chemicals can leach from plastics into the food people eat or into the dust in the air.</p><p>\"Obviously, having it in our digestive tract, the potential for direct exposure could potentially be greater,\" Spaeth said.</p><p>The findings were presented Monday at the United European Gastroenterology annual meeting in Vienna. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>Schwabl and his team hope to do larger follow-up studies to verify their findings and to further explore the possible effects on human health.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency has more about <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/trash-free-waters/epa-reports\" target=\"_new\">plastics and health</a>.</p>",

They included polypropylene used in bottle caps, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) used in drink bottles, polystyrene found in plastic utensils and cups, and polyethylene used in plastic bags and storage containers.</p><p>Schwabl said he found the data \"astonishing.\"</p><p>\"I believe that trying to reduce plastic usage and plastic-packed food might be beneficial for nature and for us,\" Schwabl said. \"Certainly, plastic is a very useful material and has a lot of clever applications. But maybe we should try to rethink about the necessity of abundant plastic use, and search for and support ecological and sustainable alternatives.\"</p><p>It's too soon to tell whether these plastic particles could harm people, Schwabl and other experts said.</p><p>\"We're seeing increasing evidence that it's in people. Now we need to think about how it will impact human health,\" said Dr. Kenneth Spaeth, chief of occupational and environmental medicine at Northwell Health in Great Neck, N.Y. \"We know that plastics contain an array of potentially harmful substances that in other contexts we know can leach out and potentially affect human health.\"</p><p>The new study follows a report last week that microplastics can be found in 90 percent of table salt. Salt samples from 21 countries in Europe, North and South America, Africa and Asia were analyzed; of 39 salt brands tested, 36 contained microplastics, the <i>National Geographic</i> reported.</p><p>For the stool study, Schwabl and his team recruited one test subject each from Finland, the Netherlands, Poland, Austria, Italy, the United Kingdom, Russia and Japan. The group consisted of three women and five men ranging in age from 33 to 65.</p><p>Each person kept a food diary during the week before they provided a stool sample. The diaries showed that all participants had consumed plastic-wrapped foods or drank from plastic bottles. Six had consumed ocean fish.</p><p>Lab tests found microplastic particles from 9 out of 10 plastic types, with sizes ranging from 50 to 500 microns. A human hair has a diameter of about 50 microns.</p><p>Other plastic types included polyoxymethylene (car parts and food industry), polycarbonate (construction and electronics), nylon (rope, fishing nets and textiles) and polyurethane (ship varnish, construction and auto parts).</p><p>There are a couple of ways these plastic particles could be winding up inside of people, Schwabl suggested.</p><p>Microplastics to wind up in food through plastic packaging, or could enter the food chain by being eaten by sea life, he said.</p><p>\"In our study, most participants drank liquids from plastic bottles, but also fish and seafood ingestion was common,\" Schwabl noted.</p><p>There are no human studies that show how microplastics might affect human health, Schwabl said. But animal studies have shown that microplastic particles are capable of entering the blood stream, lymphatic system and liver.</p><p>Inside the gut, the microplastics could cause intestinal damage or alter the shape of the villi that line the intestinal wall, said Dr. Arun Swaminath, director of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>There's also some concern regarding the endocrine-disrupting chemicals contained in these plastics, Spaeth said. Human studies have found that these chemicals can leach from plastics into the food people eat or into the dust in the air.</p><p>\"Obviously, having it in our digestive tract, the potential for direct exposure could potentially be greater,\" Spaeth said.</p><p>The findings were presented Monday at the United European Gastroenterology annual meeting in Vienna. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>Schwabl and his team hope to do larger follow-up studies to verify their findings and to further explore the possible effects on human health.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency has more about <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/trash-free-waters/epa-reports\" target=\"_new\">plastics and health</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 6, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Gavin Kuykendall's life has been shaped by his fight against heart disease. Now almost 12, he recently expressed all he's been through -- by writing a letter to his heart disease.</p> <p>\"You made my parents very sad,\" he said, reading his letter in a video. \"You tried to make my birthday an overwhelming and unhappy day. Even though you made me incredibly sick, I was brave, I was strong.\"</p> <p>Like all first-time parents-to-be, Faith and Adam Kuykendall were looking forward to their 20-week ultrasound and the chance to take another peek at their unborn child. </p> <p>\"Everything was going great until the doctor got to the heart,\" Faith said. \"You could just see his face drop and he said, 'Oh no.' \"</p> <p>Tests showed their son had a rare condition in which the left ventricle doesn't develop properly. It's called hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). The left ventricle is responsible for pumping freshly oxygenated blood out to the rest of the body.</p> <p>Without immediate intervention, HLHS is fatal, usually within days or weeks.</p> <p>Such specialized care wasn't available in their hometown of Tulsa. Their frequent medical appointments and the delivery would need to be in Oklahoma City, nearly two hours away.</p> <p>Gavin arrived after 28 hours of labor. Although Faith and Adam had been warned they could see a child \"blue and limp or not breathing,\" he came out screaming -- a great sign.</p> <p>Four days later, Gavin underwent open-heart surgery to create a way for the right ventricle to pump blood to both the lungs and the body. Doctors implanted a shunt that directs blood to the lungs.</p> <p>Doctors left the incision open for a few days until the swelling subsided.</p> <p>\"That was the worst,\" Faith said. \"He was naked and swollen. You could literally see his heart beating in his chest.\"</p> <p>Gavin remained in the hospital for a month. Four months later, it was time for a second procedure.</p> <p>Typically, this one is easier on the child. But Gavin \"wasn't eating, his left side wasn't functioning, and he was shaking,\" Faith said.</p> <p>Doctors discovered that not only had Gavin suffered a stroke during surgery, he'd become addicted to the powerful narcotics he'd been given. He was going through withdrawal, for which he was treated with methadone.</p> <p>Those first few years were tough for the Kuykendalls. Family, their church community and others in their support system helped them persevere, providing meals and ensuring that someone was always with Gavin. </p> <p>\"We even had a family CPR class so everyone would know what to do, just in case,\" Faith said.</p> <p>Their network came through again in 2009, when it was time for a third surgery.</p> <p>The surgeon who'd cared for Gavin had left Oklahoma for San Diego, leaving their home state without anyone capable of performing the operation. </p> <p>Friends and family helped raise the needed funds to travel to San Diego to stay with the same doctor. And all went well. At 2 1/2, Gavin's heart was rebuilt to the best of expectations. A few months later, Gavin became a big brother. Brody was born, thankfully with a well-formed heart. </p> <p>\"That kid is a walking comedian,\" Faith said. \"I think God knew we needed that.\"</p> <p>Gavin was 5 1/2 when he began facing more complications. Doctors determined he needed a pacemaker to help his heart beat in a regular rhythm. The family again returned to San Diego for the surgery.</p> <p>Around the same time, a close friend of the Kuykendalls -- Brandon Weeden -- was selected in the first round of the National Football League draft. Brandon's wife, Melanie, and Adam had worked together just out of college, and the couples had become close friends. </p> <p>The Weedens were disappointed to learn that the state of Oklahoma lacked the specialists to operate on Gavin and other children. So after signing his NFL contract, Weeden started a foundation, which in turn helped establish a cardiac surgery research program at The Children's Hospital in Oklahoma City.</p> <p>\"I have so much respect for Gavin and the whole family,\" said Weeden, who now plays for the Houston Texans. \"He's already been through more in his lifetime than I'll ever go through. We have birthdays a day apart and try to celebrate together. I just think the world of him.\"</p> <p>Gavin is now in sixth grade and plays right field on his baseball team. Although he also loves football, he's not allowed to play contact sports. </p> <p>\"Of course he wants to do what all the other boys are doing, and that's a struggle,\" Faith said. \"Although he has some anxieties, and some physical and intellectual limitations, I don't want him to think that heart disease defines him. Luckily, he is the most determined, strong-willed child.\"</p> <p>Gavin said he's particularly proud of inspiring Weeden's foundation to help other children in Oklahoma. </p> <p>\"I want people to know that no matter what you have, or what you feel like, you're not alone,\" Gavin said. \"You can do this.\"</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Sept. 19, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- If a pregnant woman eats a lot of high-gluten foods, the odds that her child will have type 1 diabetes rise significantly, new research suggests.</p><p>In the study, pregnant women who had the highest consumption of gluten had double the risk of having a child with type 1 diabetes compared to those who ate the least gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye and barley. </p><p>However, the study authors noted that it's too soon to recommend that pregnant women change their diets based on the results of this one study.</p><p>\"The study brings new ideas to how type 1 diabetes develops. We did not know that the pregnancy period is important for the development of the disease [or] that the development of the disease is starting that early in life,\" said study co-author Dr. Knud Josefsen.</p><p> \"And it also holds the potential to reduce the frequency of the disease by simply changing the diet during pregnancy,\" added Josefsen, a senior researcher at the Bartholin Institute in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p><p>However, \"the study is observational and the link that we describe is an association,\" and not a cause-and-effect relationship, Josefsen said. The research also needs to be repeated in other populations. </p><p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that causes the body's immune system to mistakenly attack the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, according to JDRF (formerly Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation). Insulin is a hormone that helps usher the sugar from foods into the body's cells to be used as fuel. </p><p>The attack on the immune system cells leaves someone with type 1 diabetes with little to no insulin. Without insulin injections -- via multiple shots a day or an insulin pump -- someone with type 1 diabetes doesn't have enough insulin to survive. </p><p>Gluten is found in many foods -- including bread, pasta, cereal, crackers and cookies -- according to the Celiac Disease Foundation. Gluten triggers the immune system disorder called celiac disease that causes damage to the small intestine when gluten is consumed.</p><p>There's already a known link between celiac disease and type 1 diabetes -- approximately 10 percent of people with type 1 diabetes also have celiac disease, Josefsen said.</p><p>The latest study included data from almost 64,000 pregnant women enrolled from 1996 through 2002. Nearly 250 of these women's children developed type 1 diabetes. </p><p>The women answered questions about the foods they ate when they were 25 weeks' pregnant. </p><p>The average gluten intake was 13 grams per day. The range was less than 7 grams per day to more than 20 grams per day. Josefsen said a slice of bread has about 3 grams of gluten. A large serving of pasta -- about two-thirds of a cup -- has 5 to 10 grams of gluten, he said.</p><p>The researchers found that a child's risk of type 1 diabetes increased proportionally with every 10 grams of the mother's daily gluten intake. </p><p>Josefsen said there are some theories as to how gluten might contribute to the rise of type 1 diabetes. One is that gluten may cause inflammation and an immune response. </p><p>Maija Miettinen, co-author of an editorial that accompanied the study, said most of the theories as to how these two conditions might be related come from animal models. Like Josefsen, she said more research is needed.</p><p>\"This is the first study to suggest an association between high gluten intake during pregnancy and the risk of type 1 diabetes in the offspring. Therefore, it is too early to change dietary recommendations concerning gluten intake,\" she said. Miettinen is a researcher with the National Institute for Health and Welfare in Helsinki, Finland.</p><p>Miettinen also pointed out that women who have high-gluten diets in pregnancy may also continue to serve their children high-gluten fare. \"We do not know whether the possible risk associated with high gluten intake comes through prenatal exposure, childhood diet or both,\" she said. </p><p>The study was published online Sept. 19 in the <i>BMJ</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p> Harvard T.H.

She is a research fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.</p><p>\"We are not the first group talking about noise and cardiovascular disease,\" Radfar said. \"What we really show here is the mechanism linking noise to major adverse cardiovascular events.\"</p><p>For the study, Radfar and her colleagues analyzed imaging scans of 499 healthy people, looking specifically at their brains and blood vessels.</p><p>The investigators then used the participants' home addresses to obtain noise level estimates of their neighborhoods, based on aviation and highway noise data kept by the U.S. Department of Transportation.</p><p>People in the noisiest neighborhoods had higher levels of activity in their amygdala and more inflammation in their arteries, the researchers found.</p><p>The research team then followed the study participants for an average 3.7 years, to see if these symptoms of stress would lead to heart problems.</p><p>The findings showed that people exposed to chronic noise had a greater than threefold risk of suffering a heart attack, stroke or other major cardiovascular event, compared with people who had lower levels of noise exposure.</p><p>That risk remained elevated even after the researchers accounted for other risk factors, such as air pollution, high cholesterol, smoking and diabetes.</p><p>But the study could not prove that noise caused heart risks to rise.</p><p>Still, the amygdala appears to increase heart risk by triggering the release of hormones that fuel blood vessel inflammation, the researchers concluded.</p><p> Dr. Nieca Goldberg is director of the NYU Langone Tisch Center for Women's Health in New York City. She said, based on this research, noise is \"a link in the chain of cardiovascular risk, and I think it is an interesting question for doctors to ask their patients when assessing their cardiac risk.\" </p><p>Radfar even suggested that people affected by transportation noise might consider soundproofing their homes.</p><p>On a community level, highway and urban planners can protect the populace by making road-noise barriers a part of road construction, Radfar suggested.</p><p>And, Goldberg added, if you're in a noisy neighborhood, you might also want to consider other ways to reduce your stress. These might include yoga, meditation or aerobic exercise.</p><p>The findings are to be presented Nov. 11 at the American Heart Association's annual meeting, in Chicago.

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Oct. 5, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- After years of public health warnings about antibiotic misuse, a new study suggests the problem is far from being solved.</p><p>Researchers found that of more than 500,000 antibiotic prescriptions they analyzed, nearly half were written without an infection-related diagnosis. And about 20 percent were given without an office visit -- usually over the phone.</p><p>It's not clear how many of those prescriptions were actually inappropriate, said lead researcher Dr. Jeffrey Linder, of Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.</p><p>His team looked at patient records, and \"bad coding\" could be part of the problem, Linder explained. He was referring to the system doctors use for recording diagnoses.</p><p>Still, the findings are concerning, Linder said.</p><p>They suggest that some doctors are still doling out antibiotics too readily -- probably, in part, because they assume patients want them, according to Linder.</p><p>But such indiscriminate antibiotic use is a driving force behind the widespread problem of antibiotic-resistant infections. Antibiotics are effective only against bacterial infections -- not the common cold or other ills caused by viruses. When people use antibiotics unnecessarily, that exposes bacteria to the drugs and gives them a chance to mutate and become resistant.</p><p>So for years, public health experts have been warning doctors and patients against indiscriminate antibiotic use.</p><p>For the current study, Linder's team looked at nearly 510,000 antibiotic prescriptions doled out at 514 medical clinics over two years. The prescribers included doctors, nurse practitioners and physician assistants in primary care and specialties such as gastroenterology and dermatology.</p><p>Overall, 46 percent of prescriptions were given with no documented diagnosis of an infection. In 29 percent of cases, another diagnosis -- such as high blood pressure -- was recorded; 17 percent of prescriptions had no diagnosis given.</p><p>In addition, 1 in 5 prescriptions was made with no in-person visit.</p><p>There are times when prescribing by phone is fine, Linder noted. If a woman with a history of urinary tract infections develops those symptoms, he said, it may be \"perfectly appropriate\" to prescribe an antibiotic without a visit.</p><p>Another example would be a prescription refill for someone taking antibiotics for acne, Linder said. But for the most part, he added, patients should be seen in the office before getting an antibiotic.</p><p>Linder was to present the findings Friday at IDWeek 2018, an annual meeting of infectious disease specialists, in San Francisco. In general, studies presented at meetings are considered preliminary until they are published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>Dr. Ebbing Lautenbach, chief of the infectious diseases division at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed the study can't show whether all of the prescriptions were actually inappropriate. \"But this certainly raises concerns that antibiotics are often prescribed for reasons that are unclear,\" he added.</p> <p>Lautenbach said patients should feel free to ask questions when an antibiotic is prescribed. \"Sometimes an antibiotic is an appropriate choice, and sometimes it's not. Providers should explain, 'Here's why I think an antibiotic is necessary.' And there should be a discussion of the pros and cons of taking one,\" he suggested.</p><p>Besides the public health issue of antibiotic resistance, the drugs can also have side effects for any one person, like nausea and diarrhea, and interactions with other medications, Lautenbach noted.</p> <p>Linder said his team plans to take a \"deeper dive\" into their data, to learn more about the conditions doctors were treating with antibiotics.</p><p>For now, Linder said there could be multiple reasons that doctors would prescribe an antibiotic even if there is no definite diagnosis of a bacterial infection. Time demands, for example, may push some doctors to throw an antibiotic at a sore throat.</p><p>In some cases, Linder said, a patient might insist on an antibiotic, and the doctor gives in.</p><p>\"But I think that more often, the problem is the doctor's perception that patients want antibiotics,\" he said.</p><p>Linder suggested that patients take a more proactive role when it comes to the medications.</p><p>\"You can tell your doctor that you only want an antibiotic if it's really necessary,\" he said. \"That will automatically shift the doctor's default position on it.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>To learn more about proper antibiotic use, visit the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/community/about/should-know.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 5, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Some bystanders may avoid performing CPR on women because they fear hurting them, or even being accused of sexual assault, preliminary research suggests.</p><p>In two new studies, researchers tried to dig deeper into a puzzling pattern that has been seen in past research: Women are less likely than men to receive bystander CPR if they go into cardiac arrest in a public place.</p><p>One study confirmed that real-world phenomenon in a controlled setting: It found that even in \"virtual reality\" simulations, participants were less likely to perform CPR when the virtual victim was female, versus male.</p><p>People performed CPR on 65 percent of male victims, but only 54 percent of females.</p><p>A separate study, which surveyed 54 adults, turned up some possible explanations.</p><p>Respondents said bystanders may worry about hurting a woman while doing CPR chest compressions -- or fear being accused of sexual assault. Some said people also might believe women's breasts get in the way of CPR.</p><p>The respondents also cited a long-standing misconception: Women are less likely to have heart problems than men.</p><p>But the reality is that heart disease is the leading killer of U.S. women and men alike, according to government figures.</p><p>And when cardiac arrest strikes, CPR can be lifesaving, regardless of sex, said Dr. Sarah Perman, who led the survey.</p><p>People in cardiac arrest need immediate chest compressions, said Perman, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver.</p><p>\"Providing this lifesaving procedure for women should be normalized, and not sexualized,\" she said.</p><p>In the United States, more than 356,000 people suffer cardiac arrest outside a hospital each year. Only about 11 percent survive, according to the American Heart Association (AHA).</p><p>Survival is dismal because without emergency treatment, cardiac arrest is fatal within minutes. But quick CPR can double or triple survival odds, the AHA says.</p><p>Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating and cannot pump blood and oxygen to the body. If a bystander performs CPR, that keeps the victim's blood circulating, buying time until paramedics arrive. Cardiac arrest is not a heart attack, which is caused by an artery blockage that diminishes blood flow to the heart.</p><p>\"There is still a lot of misunderstanding about cardiac arrest and CPR,\" said Dr. Aaron Donoghue of the AHA and the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Men and women benefit equally from CPR chest compressions, Donoghue said, adding that the notion that it could injure women is \"false.\"</p><p>As for fears of being accused of sexual assault, Donoghue noted that chest compressions are performed on the breastbone (also called the sternum, it's the long flat bone in the center of the chest) -- not the breasts.</p><p>\"It would be terrible for that fear to deter a would-be rescuer from performing CPR,\" said Donoghue, who was not involved in the new studies.</p><p>\"Doing nothing is always worse than doing something,\" he added.</p><p>For its pilot study, Perman's team surveyed 54 U.S. adults. Participants were asked: \"Do you have any ideas on why women may be less likely to receive CPR than men when they collapse in public?\"</p><p>Their answers reflect their personal perceptions, Donoghue pointed out. So, he said, it's hard to know whether witnesses to cardiac arrest really do act on such beliefs in the real world.</p><p>Perman agreed, saying more research is needed to understand why women are less likely to receive CPR. She and her colleagues have already conducted a larger survey, she said, but the results have not been published yet.</p><p>For now, Donoghue suggested people educate themselves about cardiac arrest and CPR. The AHA website is one place to start, he said.</p><p>Both studies are scheduled for presentation Nov. 10 at an AHA meeting, in Chicago. Research presented at meetings is typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart Association has guidance on <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/cpr\" target=\"_new\">performing CPR</a>.</p>",

He's a cardiovascular research fellow with Imperial College London.</p><p>\"Improvement in function represents remission rather than permanent improvement for many patients,\" Halliday explained.</p><p>The hearts of people with dilated cardiomyopathy can't pump strong enough because the left ventricle of their heart has become stretched out and thin-walled.</p><p>Several different types of medications -- diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) -- can help the heart beat improve.</p><p>But these drugs can place a financial strain on patients and come with a host of side effects, Halliday said. Patients with recovered heart function often ask whether they can drop their meds.</p><p>To see whether this could be possible, Halliday and his colleagues recruited 51 heart failure patients to have their heart meds gradually withdrawn.</p><p>The patients received regular clinical reviews, followed by an evaluation at six months.</p><p>Around four out of 10 patients relapsed during the drug-withdrawal period, and had to be placed back on medication immediately.</p><p>\"They did seem to recover when we put them back on medications very quickly,\" Halliday said.</p><p>About half of patients completed the follow-up period without needing to go back on meds, the researchers reported.</p><p>The findings were presented Sunday at the American Heart Association annual meeting, in Chicago. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>These results show that \"we should tread lightly\" when patients ask to be taken off their heart medications, said Dr. Jane Wilcox, an assistant professor of cardiology with Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, in Chicago.</p><p>For the patients who relapsed, their heart failure came back \"within just eight weeks of withdrawal of medication. Eight weeks. Two months,\" Wilcox said.</p><p>\"The question of recovery versus remission has potentially been answered by this pilot study. Currently, in 2018, we have no true signature of recovery,\" Wilcox said. \"These patients indeed are in cardiac remission.\"</p><p>Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones is chair of preventive medicine at Northwestern. The study helps inform \"an incredibly important clinical question that comes up all the time,\" he said.</p><p>\"It does push us down the path of trying to understand better which patients in the future we might want to select for withdrawal of drug therapy, because no patient wants to be on more medications than they need to be,\" Lloyd-Jones said. \"For the time being, this class of patients is going to have to maintain their medications until we understand more.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on dilated cardiomyopathy, visit the <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cardiomyopathy/what-is-cardiomyopathy-in-adults/dilated-cardiomyopathy-dcm\" target=\"_new\">American Heart Association</a>.</p>",

The concept holds that mentally engaging activities -- from reading to crosswords to board games -- may help the brain resist dementia later in life.</p><p>In this study, older adults who said they enjoyed those pastimes were no less likely to show signs of mental decline over time, versus other older folks.</p><p>But they did, on average, score higher on standard tests of mental sharpness. That means that while they did decline over time, they did so from a higher \"starting point,\" the researchers explained.</p><p>\"The results indicate that a lifetime of engagement lifts you to a high point from which you decline, and that can be considered as passive cognitive reserve,\" said lead researcher Roger Staff, of the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.</p><p>\"Starting from a high point,\" he said, \"will mean that the threshold at which you are considered impaired will be farther into the future.\"</p><p>\"Cognitive reserve\" can be seen as the brain's ability to find alternative ways to get things done. In theory, a person with greater cognitive reserve may be able to withstand pathological changes in the brain for a longer time before showing signs of dementia.</p><p>\"The idea is that yes, you'll decline -- but the higher the level you start from, the more years you'll have with good functioning,\" said Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association.</p><p>Fargo, who was not involved in the study, saw the results in a positive light -- agreeing that they support the cognitive reserve hypothesis.</p><p>However, he said, they do not actually prove that study participants' penchant for puzzles directly boosted their brain power.</p><p>That takes \"intervention trials,\" Fargo said -- where people would be randomly assigned to engage in certain mentally stimulating activities or not.</p><p>The Alzheimer's Association is launching a trial, dubbed POINTER, that will test the effects of mental stimulation along with other lifestyle changes -- including exercise, social engagement and better control of health conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes.</p><p>It will look at whether those measures can protect mental function in older adults at increased risk of decline.</p><p>The latest study included nearly 500 older British adults who had all taken the same intelligence test when they were about 11 -- back in the 1940s. Starting at the age of 64, they answered questions about whether they engaged in intellectually stimulating activities, such as solving puzzles, playing board games, reading or going to museums.</p><p>They also took standard tests of memory and thinking over the next 15 years -- up to five times.</p><p>Overall, the study found, people who liked to challenge their minds were no less likely to show mental decline over time. But they did perform better on the memory and thinking tests -- especially those who enjoyed problem-solving activities like puzzles.</p><p>That was true even when the researchers factored in childhood intelligence and education level.</p><p>The results were published Dec. 10 in the <i>BMJ</i> journal.</p><p>Staff agreed that the findings do not prove a cause-and-effect link. But, he said, they do support the importance of feeding the mind -- ideally starting early in life.</p><p>\"Have a hungry mind,\" Staff advised. \"It's like money in the cognitive bank.\"</p><p>But is it ever \"too late\" for older adults to take up chess or crosswords?</p><p>Fargo said there's not enough evidence to answer that question. But, he stressed, research does suggest that adults can help protect their brain health through various lifestyle choices.</p><p>Those include exercising regularly, eating healthfully, not smoking, getting enough sleep -- and, yes, staying mentally active.</p><p>And if you don't like puzzles, find something else that uses your mental skills in a fun way.</p><p>\"Most people do get some enjoyment from challenging themselves,\" Fargo said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Alzheimer's Association suggests <a href=\"https://www.alz.org/help-support/brain_health/10_ways_to_love_your_brain\" target=\"_new\">10 Ways to Love Your Brain</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 26, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The wheezy lung disease asthma is yet one more problem linked to excess weight in childhood, a new study suggests. </p><p>The research contends that as many as 10 percent of pediatric asthma cases in the United States could be avoided if childhood obesity were eliminated. </p><p>\"There are very few preventable risk factors for asthma -- obesity may actually be the only one. About 6 to 8 million kids have asthma, so if 10 percent of these cases were removed (by eradicating obesity) that would be up to 800,000 kids without asthma,\" said the study's lead author, Dr. Jason Lang. </p><p>He's an associate professor with Duke University School of Medicine's  division of allergy, immunology and pulmonary medicine, in Durham, N.C. </p><p>About 18 percent of children in the United States are obese. This can impair their quality of life and boost the risk of chronic illnesses, the study authors said. </p><p>Although adult asthma and obesity have been linked, there's been debate about whether obesity is a factor in childhood asthma, the researchers explained. The current study sought to address some of the concerns with previous research, Lang said. </p><p>The new research looked at data from more than a half-million children and about 19 million doctors' visits. These visits took place at one of six major children's health centers across the United States. </p><p>The children were diagnosed with asthma at two or more doctor's appointments. They were also given lung function tests (a step missing in some previous research), and a prescription, such as an inhaler, to treat their asthma. </p><p>Children who were obese were 30 percent more likely to be diagnosed with asthma. Kids who were overweight had a 17 percent increased risk of asthma, the findings showed. </p><p>How could excess weight lead to asthma? </p><p>No one knows for sure yet. And this study doesn't prove a cause-and-effect relationship. </p><p> But there are several theories, Lang said. One is that children who are obese may have alterations in lung growth that might lead to smaller airways, which would allow for more airflow obstruction. It's possible that obesity can lead to changes that make the lungs more over-reactive, he  suggested. </p><p>Lang said it's also possible that other conditions linked to obesity -- such as acid reflux or sleep apnea -- might contribute to asthma. \"Or, it may not be that it's just one thing. It may be a combination,\" he said. </p><p>Dr. Sophia Jan, chief of pediatrics at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y., said the link between the two conditions isn't clear, but inflammation caused by obesity may play a role. She also suggested that certain genes may underlie both conditions. </p><p>And, finally, \"Once a child has developed obesity, the weight in their chest and upper body probably exerts weight on their lungs, thereby affecting the lung's overall ability to expand and function,\" she said. Jan also suspects that multiple factors link obesity and asthma. </p><p>So, what can parents do? </p><p>According to Lang, \"There is literature that shows when kids and adults do lose weight, their asthma gets much better and may even go away completely.\" </p><p>He noted that physical activity is an important part of any weight loss efforts and suggested kids follow recommended guidelines and get at least an hour a day of activity. </p><p>\"Activity expands the lungs and gives periods of high ventilation. It's healthy for lungs to do that,\" Lang said. </p><p>Jan added that maintaining a healthy weight is healthy for many reasons.</p><p> \"Besides the long-term cardiovascular benefits -- preventing heart disease, stroke and diabetes -- there are numerous short-term benefits, including decreasing the risk of sleep apnea, heartburn, gallstones, muscle and joint pain, poor self-esteem, anxiety and bullying,\" she said. </p><p>And, now, preventing or minimizing the severity of asthma can be added to that list, she noted. </p><p>Results of the study were published online Nov. 26 in <i>Pediatrics</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>To learn more about the connection between weight and asthma, go to the <a href=\"https://www.lung.org/about-us/blog/2016/07/the-link-between-asthma-weight.html\" target=\"_new\">American Lung Association</a>.</p>",

And the declines observed were small, the study authors added.</p><p> \"It was only a small group who had cognitive problems after chemotherapy treatment, and those women were distinct in having that APOE4 gene,\" said lead researcher Dr. Jeanne Mandelblatt. She is a professor of oncology at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, in Washington, D.C.</p><p>These results are good news for the large majority of breast cancer survivors. Most women who received chemotherapy or hormone therapy didn't experience long-term thinking or memory declines related to either their cancer or their treatment, the findings showed.</p><p>\"Our study suggests that, for most older breast cancer patients, chemotherapy and hormonal treatments do not have major adverse effects on cognitive function, at least as measured by our current tests,\" Mandelblatt said.</p><p>Experts have long been concerned that older people might be at increased risk for thinking and memory problems related to cancer treatment, Mandelblatt said.</p><p>Aging is already related to dementia and Alzheimer's disease, she noted, and seniors also face a number of other health problems that affect their ability to think.</p><p>For the study, researchers recruited 344 breast cancer patients between the ages of 60 and 98. These women were compared with 347 healthy women of similar ages, to see whether breast cancer or its treatments spurred any sort of intellectual decline.</p><p>Both groups of women were given a battery of 13 cognitive tests at the beginning of the study, before cancer patients received any treatment. They were re-tested one and two years later.</p><p>Tests showed that women treated with hormone therapy suffered no long-term cognitive problems, whether or not they carried the APOE4 gene.</p><p>But breast cancer patients with the APOE4 gene did experience a notable decline in thinking and memory if they received chemotherapy, the researchers reported.</p><p>\"The APOE4 gene is a very strong genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease,\" Mandelblatt said. \"There's probably some interaction between chemotherapy and something this gene controls, but we're very careful to say this finding needs to be replicated.

But this new report says an additional 14 million youngsters ages 11 to 12 would have to be vaccinated in the next eight years to reach that objective.</p><p>Reaching the 80 percent goal \"has the potential to prevent deaths from several cancers,\" said investigators led by Stacey Fedewa, director of screening and risk factor surveillance for the American Cancer Society.</p><p>In 2016, almost 36 percent of females and nearly 32 percent of males were up to date with the HPV vaccine by their 13th birthday. To reach 80 percent by 2026, the researchers determined that 6.77 million more girls and an additional 7.62 million boys would need to receive two doses of the vaccine, the researchers found.</p><p>A disproportionate percentage of males, whites and privately insured adolescents are not up to date with HPV vaccination, according to the study. </p><p>HPV accounts for nearly all cervical cancers as well as 91 percent of anal cancers, 70 percent of throat cancers, and 60 to 75 percent of other genital cancers, the study authors explained.</p><p>The sexually transmitted virus led to about 6,500 cancer deaths in 2014. Nine out of 10 of these cancers can be prevented through HPV vaccination, the cancer society said.</p><p>\"In our study, more than 90 percent of adolescents who had not initiated HPV vaccination by their 13th birthday had an 11- to 12-year-old wellness visit,\" Fedewa said in a news release from her organization.</p><p>\"So most adolescents presumably had an opportunity to be vaccinated during this time frame. Why it's not happening is a critical question,\" she said.</p><p>Fedewa said previous studies have shown that only about half of parents have been advised to vaccinate their child against HPV.</p><p>\"Broad implementation of the vaccine through innovative strategies for improving physician recommendations, parental acceptance, and access to care is necessary to achieve this goal,\" the study authors said.</p><p>The study was published online recently in the journal <i>Cancer</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/parents/vaccine.html\" target=\"_new\">HPV vaccination</a>.</p>",

They included polypropylene used in bottle caps, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) used in drink bottles, polystyrene found in plastic utensils and cups, and polyethylene used in plastic bags and storage containers.</p><p>Schwabl said he found the data \"astonishing.\"</p><p>\"I believe that trying to reduce plastic usage and plastic-packed food might be beneficial for nature and for us,\" Schwabl said. \"Certainly, plastic is a very useful material and has a lot of clever applications. But maybe we should try to rethink about the necessity of abundant plastic use, and search for and support ecological and sustainable alternatives.\"</p><p>It's too soon to tell whether these plastic particles could harm people, Schwabl and other experts said.</p><p>\"We're seeing increasing evidence that it's in people. Now we need to think about how it will impact human health,\" said Dr. Kenneth Spaeth, chief of occupational and environmental medicine at Northwell Health in Great Neck, N.Y. \"We know that plastics contain an array of potentially harmful substances that in other contexts we know can leach out and potentially affect human health.\"</p><p>The new study follows a report last week that microplastics can be found in 90 percent of table salt. Salt samples from 21 countries in Europe, North and South America, Africa and Asia were analyzed; of 39 salt brands tested, 36 contained microplastics, the <i>National Geographic</i> reported.</p><p>For the stool study, Schwabl and his team recruited one test subject each from Finland, the Netherlands, Poland, Austria, Italy, the United Kingdom, Russia and Japan. The group consisted of three women and five men ranging in age from 33 to 65.</p><p>Each person kept a food diary during the week before they provided a stool sample. The diaries showed that all participants had consumed plastic-wrapped foods or drank from plastic bottles. Six had consumed ocean fish.</p><p>Lab tests found microplastic particles from 9 out of 10 plastic types, with sizes ranging from 50 to 500 microns. A human hair has a diameter of about 50 microns.</p><p>Other plastic types included polyoxymethylene (car parts and food industry), polycarbonate (construction and electronics), nylon (rope, fishing nets and textiles) and polyurethane (ship varnish, construction and auto parts).</p><p>There are a couple of ways these plastic particles could be winding up inside of people, Schwabl suggested.</p><p>Microplastics to wind up in food through plastic packaging, or could enter the food chain by being eaten by sea life, he said.</p><p>\"In our study, most participants drank liquids from plastic bottles, but also fish and seafood ingestion was common,\" Schwabl noted.</p><p>There are no human studies that show how microplastics might affect human health, Schwabl said. But animal studies have shown that microplastic particles are capable of entering the blood stream, lymphatic system and liver.</p><p>Inside the gut, the microplastics could cause intestinal damage or alter the shape of the villi that line the intestinal wall, said Dr. Arun Swaminath, director of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>There's also some concern regarding the endocrine-disrupting chemicals contained in these plastics, Spaeth said. Human studies have found that these chemicals can leach from plastics into the food people eat or into the dust in the air.</p><p>\"Obviously, having it in our digestive tract, the potential for direct exposure could potentially be greater,\" Spaeth said.</p><p>The findings were presented Monday at the United European Gastroenterology annual meeting in Vienna. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>Schwabl and his team hope to do larger follow-up studies to verify their findings and to further explore the possible effects on human health.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency has more about <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/trash-free-waters/epa-reports\" target=\"_new\">plastics and health</a>.</p>",

Since kidney failure affects more than 100,000 Americans each year, 0.6 percentage points equals hundreds of patients a year, according to Trivedi.</p><p>Medicaid expansion led to a decrease in kidney failure patients without insurance by 4.2 percentage points, the researchers said.</p><p>\"Multiple factors not explored in our paper may have contributed to the reduction of mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease,\" said study lead author Shailender Swaminathan, an adjunct assistant professor at Brown's School of Public Health.</p><p>\"Medicaid may have resulted in better adherence to treatment sessions, normally three times a week, because it eliminated copayments of about $150 per week,\" Swaminathan said. </p><p>\"On the other hand, because out-of-pocket medical payments were reduced, Medicaid may have also improved patients' finances, thereby improving health.

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 27, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- If you've got a sweet tooth, but you're worried about type 2 diabetes, you might want to skip sugary drinks. </p><p>New research suggests that drinking sugar-sweetened beverages, such as cola, likely boost your risk of type 2 diabetes much more than the sugar found in fruit or even 100 percent fruit juices. </p><p>\"All foods are not created equal,\" said study author Dr. John Sievenpiper, an associate professor and staff physician at the University of Toronto and St. Michael's Hospital in Canada.</p><p>\"We synthesized all of the available trials looking at different food sources of sugar and blood sugar control, and sugar-sweetened beverages really stand out as having an adverse effect,\" he explained. </p><p> Sievenpiper said that 100 percent fruit juice can be healthful if it doesn't add excess calories to the diet.</p><p>\"Fruit juice can complement fruit and vegetable intake,\" he noted, \"but if you use fruit juices to stay hydrated, there is some risk.\" </p><p>Meanwhile, fruit appeared to have a protective effect on blood sugar levels, along with providing important nutrients and fiber, he said.</p><p>The effects of sugar in the diet have been hotly debated for decades. In recent years, the debate has been reignited by the parallels between the consumption of high-fructose corn syrup (a concentrated form of sugar used in many products, including soft drinks) and the rise of obesity and diabetes in the United States, according to the study authors. </p><p>To see if the type of sugars consumed has an effect on type 2 diabetes risk, the researchers reviewed data from 155 nutritional studies. All looked at the effects of foods on blood sugar levels in people with and without diabetes. The studies monitored volunteers for as long as 12 weeks. </p><p>The investigators found that fruits and fruit juices seemed to have beneficial effects on insulin and blood sugar control, especially in people with diabetes, as long as they didn't provide excess calories in the diet. So, if someone needs 2,000 calories a day to maintain their weight, a small glass of orange juice that doesn't cause that person to go over 2,000 calories is probably fine. </p><p>But foods that contain few nutrients, such as sugar-sweetened beverages, and fruit juice that provide excess calories in the diet seem to have harmful effects on blood sugar levels, the researchers said. </p><p>\"If you consider your daily caloric allotment, you don't have a lot of calories to spare, so it's important to think about what a food is giving you. Foods that don't have redeemable qualities like fiber should really be considered discretionary foods. Sugar-sweetened beverages are just pure calories,\" Sievenpiper said. </p><p>It's important to consider the whole food, he explained. For example, if you're eating a high-fiber cereal that has a little bit of sugar, \"that's probably OK,\" he said. </p><p>Registered dietician Samantha Heller from NYU Langone Health reviewed the findings.</p><p>\"Sugars from natural sources like fruits are part of a healthy diet and necessary for life -- we need it for fuel for cells and muscles. What we don't need are highly processed foods. We need to eat less highly processed foods. We're better off with real foods,\" she said. </p><p>\"It's all about balance. Fruits are part of a healthy, balanced diet. They're loaded with antioxidants and fiber, but like any other food, fruit can become a problem when we eat it in excess,\" Heller added. </p><p>The review was published online recently in the <i>BMJ</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about sugars in foods from the <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/sugar-101\" target=\"_new\">American Heart Association</a>.</p>",

Today, in his role as a professional medical interpreter, he can pinpoint the mistakes he made as a kid in conveying medical details to his family.</p> <p>\"At the beginning, I wasn't very fluent (in English),\" said Ramirez. \"So a lot of things I didn't understand.\"</p> <p>He uses that experience to help doctors, nurses and other providers communicate with patients. He also encourages patients to request the help of an interpreter if they need or want one.</p> <p>Having information in their native language is especially critical for people having a stroke, the fifth-leading cause of death among Americans and a main cause of disability among adults. Getting treatment soon after symptoms begin may mean the difference between being able to walk, talk and write afterward -- and not.</p> <p>But for patients who don't speak English well, a good recovery may depend on more than seeing a doctor quickly.</p> <p>Dr. Alejandro Magad&aacute;n is an acute stroke specialist at UT Southwestern Medical Center and Parkland Memorial Hospital. The vascular neurologist said stroke patients who've needed an interpreter but aren't provided one don't understand their health condition and don't take the medications prescribed to stave off another stroke.</p> <p>Generally, Magad&aacute;n said, those patients have a poor quality of life because \"they're going to keep coming back with more problems.\"</p> <p>Providers who don't offer a professional medical interpreter to patients who need one may deprive them of quality care, he said.</p> <p>Research appears to support that view.</p> <p>A 2017 study found that among acute stroke patients who preferred to speak to clinicians in another language, only 57 percent received the services of an interpreter, and those who weren't provided with an interpreter were less likely to receive quality care. A review of research going back at least 20 years found that professional medical interpreters help avoid misunderstandings between patients and their doctors, and leave patients more satisfied with their care.</p> <p>An estimated 23.6 million American adults have limited English-language proficiency, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. For them, federal regulations require hospitals, clinics, nursing homes and other medical service providers that receive federal funding to make reasonable efforts to help people with limited English skills have health care information in their native language.</p> <p>Yet those rules aren't always followed.</p> <p>At Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, neurologist Dr. Nicte I. Mejia said some colleagues hesitate to request professional medical interpreters because they worry the process will slow down their busy schedules. But Mejia tells her staff that interpreters are assets because they help relay accurate information and prevent mistakes, such as a patient not understanding how to take a medication.</p> <p>Medical interpreters, she said, are well-versed in medical terminology and ethical practice standards, and can communicate cultural nuances that doctors or patients may easily miss. There are also legal and privacy issues to consider, she said.</p> <p>\"At the end of the day, involving professional medical interpreters will help patients get safer, faster, better care,\" said Mejia, senior author of the 2017 study.</p> <p>But Ramirez said there's something else professional medical interpreters provide: comfort.</p> <p>\"Just going to the doctor is scary enough for anybody,\" he said.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Jan. 3, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- If  you have type 2 diabetes and you're taking canagliflozin to help control your blood sugar, a new study has some good news for you: The drug doesn't appear to raise the risk of bone fractures. </p><p>Previously, research had suggested this might be the case.</p><p>\"We were interested in doing this study because there was one randomized trial that said there was an increased risk of bone fractures and another that said there wasn't. So, we conducted a real-world study with almost 200,000 people with type 2 diabetes,\" said study author Dr. Michael Fralick.</p><p>\"I hope these findings are reassuring to patients and physicians because these are blockbuster medications for type 2 diabetes. This class of medicines can improve blood sugar levels and help reduce heart disease risk,\" he said. Fralick is from the division of pharmacoepidemiology and pharmacoeconomics at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, and a general internist at the University of Toronto. </p><p>Canagliflozin (Invokana, Invokamet) is one drug in a class of medications called SGLT-2 inhibitors. Other drugs in this class include dapagliflozin (Farxiga) and empagliflozin (Jardiance).</p><p>These drugs cause the kidneys to remove excess sugar from the blood and excrete it through urine, which lowers blood sugar levels, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This class of drugs has been linked to a number of complications, including kidney injury and serious genital infections.</p><p>Fralick said one way these drugs could potentially increase fracture risk is by lowering bone mineral density.</p><p>Dr. William Leslie, author of an editorial accompanying the study, suggested that dehydration may be another way these drugs might be linked to fracture risk. Leslie is a professor of medicine and radiology at the University of Manitoba in Canada.</p><p>For the new report, Fralick and his team reviewed data from two U.S. commercial health care databases. They found information on about 200,000 people with type 2 diabetes who were just starting to take one of two different type 2 diabetes medications -- canagliflozin or a medication in a class of drugs called GLP-1 agonists, which includes Victoza, Trulicity and Byetta. These drugs haven't been linked to an increased risk of fractures. </p><p>The researchers looked for fractures in the upper and lower arms, as well as the hips and pelvis. </p><p>In the end, the study team compared approximately 80,000 people on canagliflozin to about 80,000 treated with GLP-1 agonists. The patients' average age was 55, and about 48 percent were female. </p><p>The study showed a similar risk of fractures in these low-risk, middle-aged populations.</p><p>Both Fralick and Leslie said the jury is still out for people who are at a higher risk of fractures, such as elderly people. </p><p>This study is \"a relatively low-risk population. But, it begs the question, what about higher-risk populations? We need additional safety data,\" Leslie said.</p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration currently requires canagliflozin labels to carry a warning about the potential fracture risk, and Fralick said it may be too soon to change the labeling, particularly for people at high risk. Both experts said more research is needed.</p><p>In the meantime, if you're concerned about taking canagliflozin, Fralick recommended having a conversation with your health care provider. But, he added, \"For people without a high baseline risk, the risk of fracture is very small and the clear benefits to SGLT-2s outweigh that potential risk.\" </p><p>The findings were published online Jan. 1 in the <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about oral diabetes medications from the <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/treatment-and-care/medication/oral-medications/what-are-my-options.html\" target=\"_new\">American Diabetes Association</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Jan. 8, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Over the past 25 years, the number of Americans who have died from cancer has dropped dramatically, though racial and economic disparities persist, a new study reveals.</p><p>Between 1991 and 2016, deaths from cancer dropped 27 percent. In real numbers, that's almost 2.6 million fewer cancer deaths, according to the American Cancer Society.</p><p>\"The decline in deaths is largely driven by  reductions in smoking and improved treatment, as well as earlier detection for some cancers,\" said lead researcher Rebecca Siegel, scientific director of surveillance research at the cancer society.</p><p>This is especially true for the most common cancers, including breast, colon, lung and prostate.</p><p>But although the racial gap in cancer deaths is slowly narrowing, socioeconomic disparities are growing, she said. Poor counties in particular lag behind, and for some cancers the gap is widening, Siegel noted.</p><p>\"The largest gaps are for the most preventable  cancers,\" she said. For example, in the early 1970s, colon cancer death rates were 20 percent lower in poor counties, and today they are 35 percent higher, when compared with people living in richer counties, Siegel said.</p><p>\"Differences in wealth lead to differences in risk factors and less access to high-quality care for prevention, early detection and treatment,\" she explained.</p><p>In addition, poor people are less likely to be screened for cancer, and so cancer is likely to be diagnosed at an advanced stage that makes treatment problematic. Plus, care for the poor is not as good as that given to the rich, Siegel said.</p><p>Where the poor have access to screening, these disparities can be eliminated, she suggested. \"We have seen this in Massachusetts and Washington, D.C.,\" she said.</p><p>In addition, more education is called for to help people understand the steps they can take to lower their risk for cancer. \"Health literacy is an issue,\" Siegel said.</p><p>The report was published online Jan. 8 in <i>CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians</i>. </p><p>According to Electra Paskett, co-program leader of the cancer control program at Ohio State University's Comprehensive Cancer Center, \"The people who suffer the most are impacted by social determinants of health, which include where they live, their socioeconomic condition, their education, their income.\" </p><p>Poor people face so many problems just living day-to-day. And when they are confronted by cancer, they often don't have the access to the latest treatments, Paskett explained.</p><p>The new report noted that nearly 2 million Americans will be diagnosed with cancer this year, and more than 600,000 will die of the disease. But the cancer death rate has actually been dropping nearly 2 percent a year, from 215 deaths per 100,000 in 1991 to 156 per 100,000 in 2016.</p><p>Between 1990 and 2016, deaths from lung cancer among men dropped 48 percent, and deaths from breast cancer among women decreased 40 percent. From 1993 to 2016, deaths from prostate cancer dropped 51 percent,  and from 1970 to 2016, deaths from colon cancer plummeted 53 percent, the researchers reported.</p><p> Siegel noted that \"lung cancer still kills more Americans than breast, prostate and colon cancer combined.\"</p><p>Deaths from some cancers, however, rose. For example, deaths from liver cancer increased each  year among men and women. Pancreatic cancer deaths rose slightly among men. Brain cancer deaths also rose each year. Other cancer deaths on the rise are soft-tissue cancers (such as heart) and oral cancers linked to the human papillomavirus (HPV).</p><p>Although a vaccine for HPV is available, Paskett said, too few girls and boys are being vaccinated. The vaccine can prevent 70 percent of cervical cancers as well as many oral cancers and genital warts.</p><p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death after heart disease, the researchers reported. But cancer is the leading cause of death in many states and among Hispanics, Asian Americans and people under 80 years of age.</p><p>For cancers such as leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, pancreatic and ovarian cancers, death rates vary only slightly between the rich and poor, the investigators found.</p><p>The study authors also said that cases of melanoma have been increasing, as well as cases of liver, thyroid, uterine and pancreatic cancer.</p><p> Paskett pointed out that \"we have made great strides. But we have a long way to go.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/what-is-cancer\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Cancer Institute</a> for more on cancer.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Jan. 15, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- A stem cell transplant may help some people with multiple sclerosis (MS) when standard drugs fail, a new clinical trial finds.</p><p>The study focused on 110 patients with aggressive cases of MS: Their symptoms had flared up at least twice in the past year despite taking standard medication, and they'd already tried an average of three of those drugs.</p><p>Researchers randomly assigned the patients to either keep trying other medications or have a stem cell transplant -- using cells taken from their own blood.</p><p>Over an average of three years, MS progressed in 34 of 55 patients on medication -- meaning their disabilities worsened. That compared with only three of 55 patients given a stem cell transplant.</p><p>It's a striking difference, said lead researcher Dr. Richard Burt, adding that the results were even better than his team anticipated.</p><p>That said, Burt cautioned that only a small minority of MS patients would be possible transplant candidates. And for now, only certain medical centers have the necessary experience and expertise.</p><p>\"Any treatment that is powerful can also be dangerous,\" said Burt, who is chief of immunotherapy and autoimmune diseases at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. \"You don't want to use it too soon, or too late. And you don't want to overuse it.\"</p><p>Those precautions were echoed by Bruce Bebo, executive director of research for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.</p><p>\"This study should be celebrated,\" said Bebo, who was not involved in the research. \"It's the first randomized, controlled clinical trial of this strategy.\"</p><p>But, he stressed, the treatment is still experimental and can only be done safely at a handful of centers around the world. </p><p>Stem cell transplants are done at many hospitals to treat cancer. But, Bebo said, there's an \"art and science\" to using them for MS.</p><p>MS is a neurological disorder caused by a misguided immune system attack on the body's own myelin -- the protective sheath around nerve fibers in the spine and brain. Depending on where the damage occurs, symptoms include vision problems, muscle weakness, numbness and difficulty with balance and coordination.</p><p>About 85 percent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with the \"relapsing-remitting\" form of the disease, according to the National MS Society. That means symptoms flare up for a time and then ease. But most people eventually transition to a progressive form of the disease and their disability worsens over time.</p><p>The new trial included only patients with relapsing-remitting MS, because that point in the disease is when immune system inflammation is inflicting its damage.</p><p>Why would a stem cell transplant help? The idea, Burt explained, is to basically \"reboot\" the immune system and stop it from attacking.</p><p>Stem cells from the bone marrow are the building blocks of the immune system. In this trial, patients had a supply of their own bone marrow stem cells removed and stored, then underwent a few days of chemotherapy to knock down their existing immune system.</p><p>After that, the stored stem cells were infused back into the body, where over time, the immune system rebuilt itself.</p><p>Half of the study patients had that procedure. The other half continued with disease-modifying drugs -- like natalizumab (Tysabri), interferon (Avonex) and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone). Those medications can slow, but not stop, MS progression, Burt said.</p><p>Over the next few years, stem cell transplant patients were much less likely to see their MS progress, the study found.</p><p>\"And, Burt said, \"their quality of life markedly improved.\"</p><p>When patients rated their quality of life on a standard scale, the transplant group reported an average 20-point gain one year later. Those ratings dipped a few points among patients on medication.</p><p>The study, published in the Jan. 15 issue of the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>, was funded by government and foundation grants.</p><p>Burt cautioned that stem cell transplants carry risks, including serious, even fatal, infections while the immune system is suppressed. No patient in this trial died.</p><p>Bebo also pointed out that the study patients did not take the newest MS drugs, such as a medication called Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), which was approved after this trial ended in 2016.</p><p>\"It's unclear how stem cell transplants compare with the most effective current drug therapies,\" Bebo said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The National MS Society has more on <a href=\"https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Research/Research-News-Progress/Stem-Cells-in-MS/Bone-Marrow-Stem-Cell-Transplant-%E2%80%93-HSCT\" target=\"_new\"> stem cell transplants</a>.</p>",

The drugs target an enzyme called ATP citrate lyase (ACL), part of the production pathway for \"bad\" LDL cholesterol in the body.</p><p>In the new trial, bempedoic acid, a pill that blocks ACL, reduced LDL cholesterol levels significantly when added to standard statin therapy.</p><p>The addition of bempedoic acid on top of a statin drug showed \"a much greater reduction in LDL-C than what would be expected simply by increasing the dose of statin therapy,\" said study author Dr. Brian Ference. He directs translational therapeutics research at the University of Cambridge in England.</p><p>His team published its findings in the March 14 issue of <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p>But experts aren't certain how useful bempedoic acid might be, given the wide cholesterol-lowering arsenal now available to heart doctors.</p><p>The clinical trial results represent \"a rather modest reduction as compared to statins, which lower LDL cholesterol concentrations on average by 20 to 30 percent, and newer drugs such as PCSK9 inhibitors, which can lower LDL cholesterol concentrations by over 50 percent,\" said Dr. Michael Holmes. He's an associate professor at the University of Oxford in England, and wrote an editorial accompanying the study.</p><p>Bempedoic acid also doesn't appear to outperform ezetimibe (Zetia), a drug already on the market, said Dr. Robert Eckel, who holds an endowed chair in atherosclerosis at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Aurora.</p><p>An earlier clinical trial has shown that combining bempedoic acid and ezetimibe lowered LDL cholesterol by about 28 percent more than placebo, said Eckel, an expert with the American Heart Association who was not involved with the new study.</p><p>\"It suggests that adding ezetimibe, which is typically an 18 to 20 percent reduction, to bempedoic acid only produces a modest additional benefit,\" Eckel said. \"It's not like the 40 percent you would expect.\"</p><p>The body uses ACL further upstream in the same cholesterol synthesis process that also employs the enzyme targeted by statins, known as HMGCR, researchers said in background notes.</p><p>A study of nearly 655,000 people found that people's ACL and HMGCR scores were associated with similar patterns in LDL cholesterol levels and similar effects on heart disease risk based on those levels, researchers reported. Ference led this study.</p><p>Further, people who carry genetic variants that inhibit ACL have lower LDL cholesterol levels and lower risk of heart health problems, researchers found.</p><p>Based on this, researchers decided to test how well a drug that blocks ACL would lower cholesterol levels in average people.</p><p>That drug, bempedoic acid, was randomly assigned to 1,488 people with high LDL cholesterol despite being on high-intensity statin therapy. Another 742 statin users were given a placebo.</p><p>After a year, bempedoic acid lowered LDL cholesterol levels by 18 percentage points, researchers found.</p><p>The most troubling adverse event was the incidence of gout, which led 18 bempedoic acid patients to quit the trial, compared to three placebo patients, Holmes and Eckel said.</p><p>Gout occurs when uric acid levels rise in the bloodstream beyond the kidneys' ability to remove the harmful byproduct. High uric acid levels cause crystals to form in joints, producing inflammation and arthritis.</p><p>\"This discontinuation because of gout is something that needs to be explored further by additional study,\" Eckel said. \"That could end up to be something on the package insert that could influence prescribing patterns.\"</p><p>For example, bempedoic acid might not be best prescribed to people with gout or with already elevated uric acid levels, he said.</p><p>The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology's updated cholesterol treatment guidelines in 2018 kept the main focus on statins, which are cheap and proven effective.</p><p>But the AHA and ACC also allowed that ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors could play a role for people whose cholesterol remains elevated despite statin therapy.</p><p>\"In the setting of patients at high risk of disease who are on maximal doses of statins, additional lipid-lowering drugs will lead to a further reduction in cardiovascular disease risk, as we have seen with PCSK9 inhibitors,\" said Holmes.</p> <p>\"There is therefore a potential role for drugs that inhibit ACL, such as bempedoic acid, in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease,\" he said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart Association has more about <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cholesterol/prevention-and-treatment-of-high-cholesterol-hyperlipidemia/cholesterol-medications\" target=\"_new\">cholesterol medications</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Jan. 2, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- For many, the start of the new year signals the start of a new diet. But what's the best way to eat if you want to lose weight?</p><p>For overall healthy eating, the best diet plan is the Mediterranean diet, according to <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report's</i> annual diet review. The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet was ranked second on the magazine's overall Best Diets 2019 list, followed by the Flexitarian plan. All three plans focus on eating a mostly plant-based diet (veggies, fruits and whole grains), healthy fats and lean protein sources. </p><p>\"I hope these rankings steer people in the direction of doing something healthful,\" said nutritionist Samantha Heller of NYU Langone Health in New York City. </p><p>\"I wish though, that we weren't so obsessed with weight loss and diets, per se. I wish the focus was on adopting a healthy lifestyle, like eating a more plant-based diet, getting regular exercise, getting enough sleep and managing stress, all of which help us live a better quality of life,\" Heller said. </p><p>To that end, she said the top three diets are all similar in their food content, and all can be healthy eating regimens.</p><p>The Mediterranean diet has been linked to increased longevity and a decreased risk of chronic illnesses, the report said. The Mediterranean diet was also ranked high in multiple categories including: Easiest Diets to Follow, Best Diets for Healthy Eating, Best Diets for Diabetes, and Best Diets for Hearth Health.</p><p>If weight loss is part of your plans, here are plans that topped the rankings for the best weight-loss plans:</p><ul><li>WW (Weight Watchers)</li><li>Volumetrics</li><li>Flexitarian diet (tie)</li><li>Jenny Craig (tie)</li><li>Vegan diet (tie)</li></ul><p>Feel the need to knock off some pounds quickly?  Here are the best fast weight-loss plans:</p><ul><li>HMR program</li><li>Atkins (tie) </li><li>Keto diet (tie) </li><li>Optavia (tie) </li><li>WW (Weight Watchers) (tie)</li></ul><p>Heller said that many people feel that they need to \"kickstart\" their weight loss for motivation. The problem with plans that focus on fast weight loss, however, is that they don't teach you how to eat well every day.</p><p> \"On these types of diets, you often don't learn how to manage holidays, stressful days or special occasions. You don't develop strategies for life,\" she said.</p><p>The easiest diets to follow include the Mediterranean diet, the Flexitarian diet and WW (Weight Watchers). </p><p>The magazine asked a panel of nutrition experts to review 41 diet plans. Like Heller, the expert panelists emphasized the importance of well-balanced, sustainable diets that aren't overly restrictive. These types of diets can help teach lifelong positive eating habits.</p><p>Lifestyle diets, such as the Mayo Clinic diet and MIND diet, are healthier and more sustainable than weight-loss plans such as the Ketogenic or Atkins diet are, the panelists concluded.</p><p>Although the popular Keto diet ranked high for fast weight loss, it landed way down on the Best Diets list -- tying for number 38. Other diets at the bottom of the list included the Dukan diet, the Body Reset Diet and the Whole30 diet. </p><p>\"I think that diets that don't differentiate between healthy and unhealthy fats, over time are ultimately an unhealthy approach to losing weight,\" Heller said.</p><p>But the diet topping any list isn't necessarily the best diet for you. Choosing a diet is a \"very individual thing,\" Heller noted, adding that you have to find a diet plan that works well for you. And, hopefully one that teaches you to eat healthy for life. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about the U.S. News &amp; World Report's <a href=\"https://health.usnews.com/best-diet\" target=\"_new\">best diet rankings</a>.</p>",

That was about 25 percent more than second-place Switzerland's $7,919 and more than twice as high as Canada's $4,753, researchers found.</p><p>It was also twice what Americans spent in 2000, and 145 percent higher than the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) median of $4,033. The OECD includes 34 countries.</p><p>\"In spite of all the efforts in the U.S. to control health spending over the past 25 years, the story remains the same -- the U.S. remains the most expensive because of the prices the U.S. pays for health services,\" said study author Gerard Anderson. He's a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.</p><p>\"It's not that we're getting more; it's that we're paying much more,\" Anderson said in a school news release.</p><p>Evaluating the drivers behind soaring U.S. spending, his team cited higher drug prices, higher salaries for doctors and nurses, higher hospital administration costs and higher prices for many medical services.</p><p>Despite those higher costs, Americans have less access to many health care services than residents of other OECD countries, according to the study.</p><p>In 2015, for example, there were 7.9 practicing nurses and 2.6 practicing physicians for every 1,000 Americans, compared to the OECD medians of 9.9 nurses and 3.2 physicians.</p><p>That year, the United States had only 7.5 new medical school graduates per 100,000 people compared to the OECD median of 12.1.

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, May 1, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Hormone-based treatment might improve social function in people with autism, a pair of new clinical trials suggests.</p><p>Both focused on vasopressin, a hormone that has been implicated in the brain's ability to manage social behavior.</p><p>In the first trial, vasopressin given as a nasal spray helped improve social responsiveness in kids with autism, said lead researcher Karen Parker. She is director of Stanford University's Social Neurosciences Research Program.</p><p>\"The parents saw improvement, the clinicians saw improvement, and the children's performance on lab tests also improved with vasopressin compared to placebo,\" Parker said.</p><p>The second clinical trial did not involve vasopressin itself, but a new drug that activates the brain receptors targeted by the hormone, explained senior researcher Dr. Paulo Fontoura.

They also showed improvement in social communication, were better able to interpret emotional and mental states of others, and had diminished symptoms related to autism, such as anxiety and repetitive behaviors.</p><p>The balovaptan clinical trial involved 223 men with moderate or severe autism, the researchers said.</p><p>The patients were split into four groups, and were given either balovaptan at different doses or a placebo every day for 12 weeks.</p><p>The men did not show significant improvement as measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale, the study authors said.</p><p>But the two patient groups that received higher doses of balovaptan displayed improvements as measured by another scale that assesses socialization, adaptive behavior and daily living skills, compared with those who got a placebo.</p><p>Both vasopressin and balovaptan did not cause any serious side effects and raised no safety concerns, Parker and Fontoura said.</p><p>Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y., has mixed feelings about vasopressin-focused therapy for autism.</p><p>\"These two studies, taken together, suggest that treatments to increase vasopressin levels in the brain may be helpful for some patients with ASD,\" Adesman said. \"However, much more research is needed in terms of the long-term benefits and safety of this type of treatment.\"</p><p>Vasopressin is already available by prescription, as an antidiuretic used to treat overly frequent urination. Because of this, Adesman is concerned that parents might be tempted to seek an off-label prescription from their doctor for their child with autism.</p><p>\"I think families and physicians need to be cautious in using this medication on the basis of a single short-term study,\" Adesman said.</p><p>\"Given that there are very few if any good medication options for the treatment of ASD, I am sure there will be great interest in this novel treatment approach,\" Adesman continued. \"That said, I think much more research is needed before we can feel comfortable recommending vasopressin as a safe and effective treatment for one of the core deficits in children with ASD.\"</p><p>Both studies have proceeded to the next stage of clinical trial.</p><p>Vasopressin currently is being tested in a larger group of 100 children, Parker said.</p><p>Meanwhile, balovaptan is the focus of two clinical trials, a phase II study in children and teenagers and a phase III trial in adults, Fontoura said.</p><p>The latest findings were published May 1 in the journal <i>Science Translational Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institutes of Health has more about <a href=\" https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/autism/conditioninfo/causes \" target=\"_new\">potential causes of autism</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Jan. 8, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Turn on prime-time TV and you'll likely see a pitch for arthritis or impotence pills, and maybe a cancer center. Advertisers spent nearly $10 billion marketing prescription drugs and medical services to the American public in 2016 -- five times what they doled out 20 years earlier, a new study finds.</p><p>Experts said the results raise questions about the influence of advertising over how Americans see their health and make health-care decisions.</p><p>The study analyzed trends in \"medical marketing\" between 1997 and 2016, looking at TV and digital advertising, social media and more.</p><p>Medical marketing includes ads directed to consumers: Many are for prescription drugs, but others tout treatments, tests and various services offered by hospitals, clinics and other health providers. It also includes marketing to doctors by drug companies and lab test manufacturers.</p><p>In 2016, the study found, those advertisers spent almost $30 billion marketing to professionals and the public. That was up two-thirds from 1997, when the figure stood at $17.7 billion.</p><p>And while companies still devote more money to courting providers, spending on consumer ads rose at a much greater rate -- from $2.1 billion in 1997, to $9.6 billion in 2016. The findings were published Jan. 8 in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>.</p><p>\"It's an impressive amount of money -- and it's because companies know it works,\" said study co-author Dr. Steven Woloshin, a professor at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice.</p><p>The problem, said Woloshin, is that by nature, ads tell consumers that the product is \"good.\" Prescription drug ads mention side effects -- in a quick voiceover in a TV commercial, for instance -- but they do not quantify the benefits versus risks.</p><p>\"People don't realize that even though a drug is approved by the [U.S.] Food and Drug Administration, it may only be marginally effective,\" Woloshin said.</p><p>Nor do ads mention the alternatives for treating a particular condition -- which may be cheaper or drug-free, he noted.</p><p>\"That's not to say that marketing is always bad,\" Woloshin pointed out.</p><p>It may help lift the \"stigma\" attached to conditions like HIV or depression, he said, or help people get appropriate tests or treatments.</p><p>There's a flip side, though: overdiagnosis and overtreatment.</p><p>Woloshin mentioned a study where researchers had actors go to primary care doctors portraying symptoms of either major depression or adjustment disorder. Some specifically asked for an antidepressant, citing something they'd seen on TV.</p><p>The result: People who asked for medication were more likely to get it, even when they did not report depression symptoms.</p><p>\"Marketing can have benefits, but also harms,\" Woloshin said. \"That's why we need strong regulation.\"</p><p>However, the study found little evidence that regulation has kept pace with the explosion in marketing. According to Woloshin, the FDA has taken some action in recent years -- to curtail marketing of unapproved genetic tests that promise to reveal your risks of developing various diseases.</p><p>But the public might be surprised by how little regulatory oversight there is, said Meredith Rosenthal, a professor of health economics at the Harvard School of Public Health.</p><p>\"Don't assume an ad has been reviewed and blessed by the FDA,\" said Rosenthal, co-author of an editorial published with the study.</p><p>The FDA can act when an ad's content violates law, she noted. But it does not put a stamp of approval on every ad.</p><p>In theory, Rosenthal said, doctors are the \"bulwark,\" steering patients away from inappropriate treatments, even if they demand them. But, she noted, doctors are targeted by marketers, too, or may advertise services themselves.</p><p>Plus, Woloshin said, even when doctors try to convince patients that lifestyle changes, for example, are a better option, they can end up fighting a losing battle.</p><p>For now, he and Rosenthal suggested the public regard medical ads with a healthy dose of skepticism.</p><p>That includes \"disease awareness campaigns,\" which are often funded by drug companies, Woloshin said. </p><p>Again, Woloshin said, that kind of marketing can have benefits, but also harms when campaigns try to expand a disease definition and \"medicalize\" normal experience. He cited \"low testosterone\" as one example.</p><p>\"Some people say we should ban [medical marketing],\" Woloshin said. \"But that's not going to happen, because of the First Amendment. What we need is stronger regulation.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has a guide for consumers on <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/prescriptiondrugadvertising/default.htm\" target=\"_new\">prescription drug advertising</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 27, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Tim Landis was a healthy 66-year-old who hiked, biked and jogged, wasn't overweight and watched what he ate. But after he died suddenly of a heart attack in January, tests revealed years of untreated high blood pressure that caused cardiovascular disease.</p> <p>At his annual physicals, Tim's systolic blood pressure (the top number) was usually in the 130s and his diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) in the 80s, said his wife Debra. A year ago, that wasn't considered high.</p> <p>Now it is.</p> <p>Last November, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued new guidelines that redefined Tim's readings as stage 1 hypertension, recommending lifestyle changes and possibly medication. The old threshold for high blood pressure was 140/90.</p> <p>Before then, Tim's numbers were considered prehypertension, to be monitored but not usually treated with medication. But the new guidelines immediately reclassified about 31 million Americans as having hypertension.</p> <p>\"I wish Tim and I had thought to ask our health care providers about this over the years,\" said Debra, a freelance writer whose husband was the business editor of <i>The State Journal-Register </i>in Springfield, Ill. \"I also wish we would have done our own research.\"</p> <p>High blood pressure (hypertension) is labeled a \"silent killer\" because it often has no symptoms. But untreated over time, it can lead to heart disease, stroke, vision loss, kidney failure and other serious complications.</p> <p>While a reading below 120/80 is still considered normal blood pressure, systolic readings of 120-129 are now considered elevated blood pressure.</p> <p>\"The benchmarks are changing,\" said Dr. Jackson Wright, director of the Clinical Hypertension Program at the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center and one of the guidelines' authors. \"The major issue now is what's going to be the best way to implement the new target where we have conclusive evidence that they are effective in reducing cardiovascular events.\"</p> <p>In the year since the guidelines were issued, he said, \"I think that overall they have had a very positive effect. But whenever there's something new, there are going to be questions, disagreements and pushback.\"</p> <p>Dr. Elliot Davidson, director of the Akron General Center for Family Medicine in Ohio, called the new guidelines \"useful,\" but said the adjustment will take time.</p> <p>\"We're probably starting some people on medication that we would have just watched before, or we're getting them back in the office a little sooner to check their pressure,\" said Davidson, who was not involved in writing the ACC-AHA guidelines.</p> <p>But because other organizations also issue blood pressure guidelines, he said patients are probably experiencing some guideline fatigue. \"I think that makes it even more important to have a good relationship with a primary care physician who you can process this with,\" Davidson said.</p> <p>Just having these dialogues may be one of the most significant results of the new recommendations, said Sean Stocker, director of basic and translational research at the University of Pittsburgh Hypertension Center, who was not involved in the guidelines.</p> <p>\"This has revitalized the discussion around blood pressure control,\" he said. \"Whether it's new numbers or old numbers &hellip; we need to talk about not only what those numbers should be, but how do you actually diagnose this and then what do you do to treat it.\"</p> <p>According to federal statistics, about one in six people don't know they have high blood pressure, and only about half of people with hypertension have it under control -- and that's based on the old definition.</p> <p>Stocker said one of the most important recommendations of the new guidelines is the need to measure blood pressure more accurately, both by training doctors and technicians better and by calibrating monitors more frequently.</p> <p>As in many forms of cardiovascular disease, Stocker said, the key is awareness, and then prevention, through healthier lifestyles and, if necessary, medication.</p> <p>\"That's what the new guidelines are really suggesting,\" he said. \"Look at this sooner in your lifetime as numbers start to creep up before they get too high. And start taking actions a little bit earlier to make an impact not just on high blood pressure but other diseases.\"</p> <p>That has certainly been the impact on Debra Landis after tragically losing her husband.</p> <p>\"I'm keeping an eye on my blood pressure, getting more exercise and striving to lose weight,\" she said. \"My children and I made a promise to ourselves, because Tim would want us to do this.\"</p>",

Other types of resistance exercise include pushups, sit-ups or lunges.</p><p>Study author Duck-chul Lee said, \"Traditionally, weightlifting was for athletes, and that's why I think there is less evidence on its health benefits, specifically for the heart.\" Lee is an associate professor of kinesiology at Iowa State University. </p> <p>\"People know that running or cardio exercise is good for the cardiovascular system, but there are benefits of weightlifting on the heart that were not [previously] well-studied,\"  Lee added. </p><p>In research published separately, Lee and his colleagues found that less than an hour of weightlifting per week also reduced the risk for high cholesterol and metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions linked to diabetes. Those reports are in the journal <i>Mayo Clinic Proceedings</i>.</p><p>For the heart and stroke study, the researchers studied nearly 12,600 participants (average age 47) who had undergone at least two clinical examinations between 1987 and 2006. The participants self-reported their levels of resistance exercise, and follow-ups were done about five and 10 years later.</p><p>The results indicated that the benefits of resistance exercise on heart and stroke risk were independent of aerobic exercise such as walking or running, Lee said. </p><p>Compared with participants who did no resistance exercise, those who took part from one to three times and up to 59 minutes in all each week experienced a risk reduction of up to 70 percent.</p><p>The study didn't prove that weightlifting prevents heart attack or stroke, only that an association exists, however.</p><p>\"We found benefits of resistance exercise without body mass index [changes],\" Lee added. \"It means that even though you don't lose weight, you can still get benefits for the heart. People believe the benefits of exercise are from losing weight, but that's not true.\"</p><p>Gitig, however, expressed caution about the findings. He said the cardiovascular benefits \"seem to be a lot higher than we would expect from strength training.\"</p><p>In addition, Gitig noted that most participants were male and white, coming voluntarily to the clinic where the study was held. \"The question is if confounding variables made these people healthier to begin with,\" he said.  </p><p>Still, Gitig said he wasn't as surprised by learning about the cardiovascular benefits linked to weightlifting as he might have been five or 10 years ago.</p><p>He and Lee agreed that easing into a weightlifting routine should be safe for anyone who's healthy overall and doesn't have symptoms of cardiovascular or kidney disease. If you do, check with your doctor first, they said.</p><p>\"I would counsel my patients that [the research] is very eye-opening and suggests that strength exercise is definitely a good thing overall and may have more powerful benefits than previously thought,\" said Gitig, also an assistant professor of medicine at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.</p> <p>And what if you don't have access to free weights or weight-training machines? Digging in the yard and lugging heavy shopping bags provide strength-training benefits, too, Lee noted.</p><p>The study was published online recently in the journal <i>Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Harvard Health offers tips <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/7-tips-for-a-safe-and-successful-strength-training-program\" target=\"_new\"> for strength-training exercise</a>.</p>",

That was 18 million more than in 2016, the researchers said.</p><p>\"Trends in the impacts of climate change, exposures and vulnerabilities show unacceptably high risk for health now and in the future,\" said study author Hilary Graham, a professor at the University of York in England.</p><p>On average, each person was exposed to an additional 1.4 days of heat waves between 2000 and 2017, compared with 1986 to 2005, according to the report.</p><p>Besides adults over 65, vulnerable people live in cities, and have heart disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease, the researchers noted.</p><p>People in Europe and the eastern Mediterranean are more vulnerable than those in Africa and Southeast Asia, probably because many older Europeans live in cities. Forty-two percent of Europeans and 43 percent of people in the eastern Mediterranean are older than 65 and vulnerable to heat exposure, compared with 38 percent in Africa and 34 percent in Southeast Asia, the study found.</p><p>The annual report was published Nov. 28 in <i>The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change</i>.</p><p>Among the other findings:</p><ul><li>Between 1986 and 2017, the global temperature rose 0.3 degrees Celsius, or half of 1 degree Fahrenheit.

In focal epilepsy, seizures begin in one area of the brain. In generalized epilepsy, seizures affect both sides of the brain.</p><p>The scientists analyzed 114 pregnancies among 99 women with epilepsy and found that seizures increased during pregnancy among 53 percent of those with frontal lobe epilepsy, 22.6 percent of those with focal epilepsy and 5.5 percent of those with generalized epilepsy.</p><p>Compared to the time before pregnancy, seizures were more numerous nine months after giving birth among 20 percent of those with frontal lobe epilepsy, 7 percent of those with focal epilepsy, and 12 percent of those with generalized epilepsy.</p><p>The researchers also found that an increase in seizures tended to occur among women taking more than one epilepsy drug. They also found that for women with frontal lobe epilepsy, an increase in seizures was most likely to begin in the second trimester of pregnancy.</p><p>\"Frontal lobe epilepsy is known to be difficult to manage in general and often resistant to therapy, but it isn't clear why the seizures got worse among pregnant women because the level of medication in their blood was considered adequate,\" Voinescu said.</p><p>\"Until more research provides treatment guidance, doctors should carefully monitor their pregnant patients who have focal epilepsy, to see if their seizures increase despite adequate blood levels and then adjust their medication if necessary,\" she concluded.</p><p>The study was to be presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American Epilepsy Society, in New Orleans.

The drug was approved by the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine and will be available by prescription only.</p><p>The drug is given to the dog twice daily starting two days before an expected noise event and treatment continues through the event.</p><p> The most common side effects were difficulty standing and walking, increased appetite, lethargy, and vomiting. But three of the 90 dogs that received Pexion in the trial became aggressive, including growling at a young child and lack of restraint or self-control towards other dogs.</p><p>The drug's label information advises owners to carefully observe their dogs during treatment, the FDA said.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>More Raw Beef Recalled Due to Salmonella: USDA</b></span></p><p>More raw beef in the United States has been recalled due to possible salmonella contamination, the Department of Agriculture says.</p><p>A unit of Brazil's JBS is recalling more than 12 million pounds of raw beef that was shipped around the U.S. In October, JBS Tolleson in Arizona recalled about 7 million pounds of beef, the <i>Associated Press</i> reported.</p><p>To date, 246 illnesses have been reported, according to the USDA.</p><p>The most recent recall covers products with the USDA inspection number \"EST. 267\" that were packaged between late July and September.

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 6, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- For many breast cancer patients, removal of lymph nodes in the armpit area is a common procedure, due to worries that the tumor has spread to these tissues.</p><p>But the operation can also bring the difficult long-term side effect of lymphedema, a painful arm swelling.</p><p>Now, new Dutch research suggests that for early stage breast cancer patients, radiating the lymph nodes may bring about as good a chance of long-term survival as full removal -- perhaps sparing women those tough side effects.</p><p>The new 10-year study finds that both lymph node removal or radiation treatments \"provide excellent and comparable overall survival,\" said study co-author Dr. Mila Donker, a radiation oncologist at the Netherlands Cancer Institute. Her team was scheduled to present the new findings Thursday at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.</p><p>All things being equal, many women may now opt for radiation only and spare themselves lymphedema, said one U.S. oncologist.</p><p>\"If, in fact, the rate of recurrence in the breast or armpit is basically the same with radiation as compared to removal of lymph glands, this would make radiation very interesting as an alternative,\" said Dr. Lauren Cassell, who wasn't involved in the new study. She directs breast surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>The new research involved 1,425 women with early stage breast cancer that had spread to their armpit lymph nodes and was found by biopsy. Each patient was randomly assigned to have either surgery (744 women) or radiation therapy (681 women).</p><p>After 10 years, recurrence of cancer in the armpit lymph nodes had occurred in 1.82 percent (11 out 681 patients) of those who had received radiation therapy and 0.93 percent (7 out of 744 patients) of those who had undergone surgery.</p><p>Overall survival rates after 10 years were 81.4 percent for the radiation patients and 84.6 percent of those who'd had lymph nodes removed, Donker's team found.</p><p> Dr. Emiel Rutgers, a surgical oncologist at the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam, was the lead investigator of the new study. \"Patients with early stage invasive breast cancer who have no clinical evidence of local spread of disease to axillary (armpit) lymph nodes, meaning that palpation or ultrasound shows no sign of disease spread, undergo a sentinel lymph node biopsy,\" he explained in a meeting news release.</p><p>However,  \"data from another recent clinical trial suggested that there may be some patients who do not need axillary treatment even if they have a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy,\" Rutgers added.</p><p>The new study seems to reinforce that view, at least for some patients, he said.</p><p>\"Moving forward, we need to better tailor treatment for each individual patient. Some will still need axillary treatment, and our data indicate that axillary radiotherapy is a good option here,\" Rutgers concluded.</p><p>One other U.S. expert was encouraged by the new findings.</p><p>\"As breast surgeons, many of us have been excited about and eagerly anticipating the results,\" said Dr. Alice Police, regional director of breast surgery at Northwell Health Cancer Institute in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y.   </p><p>The notion that some patients can avoid lymph removal  \"is very appealing as a surgeon and as a human being,\" she said. Police noted that in recent years, removal of just one or two so-called \"sentinel\" lymph nodes has become routine. Surgeons use these sample nodes to assess if (and by how much) breast cancer may have spread, before deciding on whether to remove more nodes.</p><p>Already, the number of full lymph-removal surgeries has been reduced by using this sentinel node approach, she said.</p><p>And with the results of the new Dutch trial, \"we now know that even with one positive lymph node, more patients can have radiation therapy instead of more surgery,\" Police said.</p><p>\"Radiation therapy has fewer complications and is generally easier on patients,\" she said. \"This is wonderful news for breast cancer patients who can rest assured that radiation instead of more surgery will not increase their mortality rates or recurrence rates with only a small amount of [lymph node] disease. I am happy that for some patients we can make this an easier journey.\"</p><p>Because the new findings were presented at a medical meeting, they should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Cancer Society has more on <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-basics/lymph-nodes-and-cancer.html\" target=\"_new\">lymph nodes and cancer</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 6, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Although fewer Americans are dying from heart disease and cancer, deaths from chronic kidney disease are on the rise, especially among young adults, a new study finds. </p><p>\"Unfortunately, chronic kidney disease is known as a 'silent epidemic,' because many people don't realize they have it until the disease is at an advanced stage,\" said senior study author Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly. He's a nephrologist and an assistant professor of medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.</p><p>\"It is particularly concerning that chronic kidney disease is becoming more common in younger people. This is a remarkable move in the wrong direction,\" Al-Aly said in a university news release.</p><p>Deaths from cancer and cardiovascular disease have declined due to advances in treatment. But no major advances in the treatment of kidney disease have been seen during the past two decades, Al-Aly said. </p><p>Instead, chronic kidney disease has risen across the country in the past 15 years and among those aged 20 to 54 -- a group in which the condition used to be uncommon, the researchers noted. Overall, U.S. deaths from kidney disease increased 58 percent -- from about 52,100 in 2002 to 82,500 in 2016.</p><p>The researchers suspect that the increase is at least partially due to high-sugar, high-salt diets and the ongoing obesity epidemic. Unhealthy diets increase toxins that kidneys are designed to remove, which may account for the organs wearing out.</p><p>The increase in chronic kidney disease varies by state. For example, while all states saw rising rates, they are significantly higher in places with the highest obesity rates, including Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and West Virginia.</p><p>For the study, Al-Aly and his colleagues used the Global Burden of Disease database, which provides information about 350 diseases and injuries by age and gender, as well as more than 80 risk factors in the United States and other countries. For their study, the researchers focused on U.S. data by age from 2002 to 2016.</p><p>They found that the rates of chronic kidney disease are increasing faster than the rates of all noninfectious diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, cirrhosis, chronic lung diseases, mental problems and brain diseases. </p><p>Deaths from chronic kidney disease among younger adults are still rare, but they are increasing, the researchers found. For people aged 20 to 54, the probability of death from chronic kidney disease increased almost 27 percent, from 100 deaths per 100,000 people in 2002 to 125 deaths per 100,000 in 2016.</p><p>Among those aged 55 and older, chronic kidney disease deaths rose nearly 26 percent, from 1,950 deaths per 100,000 people in 2002 to 2,450 deaths per 100,000 in 2016.</p><p>\"Public health priorities, policy initiatives, funding allocation and advocacy efforts need to catch up to this reality that the burden of chronic kidney disease is rising, and the speed of change now outpaces other noncommunicable diseases,\" Al-Aly said. \"A concerted effort should be made to put the brakes on this.\"</p><p>The report was published online recently in the journal <i>JAMA Network Open</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Kidney Foundation has more on <a href=\"http://www.kidneyfund.org/kidney-disease/chronic-kidney-disease-ckd/\" target=\"_new\">chronic kidney disease</a>.</p>",

Previous studies have shown that 10 years of endocrine therapy reduces the odds for disease recurrence.</p><p>\"This study provides evidence in a large, racially diverse cohort study that black women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer experience unique barriers to endocrine therapy adherence,\" said study author Stephanie Wheeler, of the University of North Carolina School of Public Health.</p><p>This may lead to poorer outcomes, she added.</p><p>In the United States, even though black women are less likely to develop breast cancer than white women, they are 40 percent more likely to die from it, the researchers noted.</p><p>For the study, the researchers examined data on 1,280 women who said they were prescribed endocrine therapy. Almost half were black.</p><p>Overall, 24 percent of the black women reported not taking their endocrine therapy drugs as often as they should. This was true for just 16 percent of the white patients.</p><p>Also, 14 percent of black women reported not taking their pills every day, compared to 5 percent of whites.

But they didn't walk around more often, as the researchers hoped they would.</p><p>The desks, Edwardson explained, were part of a bigger educational effort that encouraged office workers to break up their day with standing and walking.</p><p>\"But it appears that participants chose to stand rather than move around,\" she said.</p><p>Still, sit-stand or standing desks can be one good step, said Dr. Esther Sternberg, director of the University of Arizona's Institute on Place, Wellbeing and Performance, in Tucson.</p><p>Sternberg -- who said she uses a standing desk -- conducts research on workplace design and employee health.</p><p>\"It used to be that the focus was on removing toxins from the workplace, which is absolutely necessary,\" Sternberg said.</p><p>But more recently, she explained, researchers have been studying the range of ways the \"built environment\" affects workers' well-being. That includes looking for ways to free desk workers from so much down time.</p><p>\"There's a saying that 'sitting is the new smoking,'\" Sternberg noted.</p><p>In a study published earlier this year, her team found that open-office designs might be healthier than cubicles or private offices: Employees in open workspaces were more physically active and less stressed than those who were walled off from each other.</p><p>However, Sternberg emphasized that that doesn't mean workers will thrive if employers \"just knock down some walls\" and dump desks and office equipment into one room.</p><p>\"Office spaces need to be thoughtfully designed,\" Sternberg said -- and there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" way of doing that, she added.</p><p>Factors ranging from the type of business to employees' individual personalities matter, too, according to Sternberg.</p><p>The new findings are based on 146 people with desk jobs within the U.K. health system. About half were randomly assigned to receive adjustable-height desks that allowed them to work sitting or standing.</p><p>A year later, the study found, those workers were standing for longer periods, versus their counterparts with traditional desks -- an average of 83 minutes more each day.</p><p>There were also signs that less sitting sparked a range of benefits. Workers with sit-stand desks gave higher ratings to their job performance and work engagement, and reported less anxiety and job fatigue.</p><p>They reported fewer aches and pains, too. For example, Edwardson said, workers with sit-stand desks were 84 percent less likely to complain of debilitating lower back pain.</p><p>For now, she suggested desk workers look for ways to get on their feet more often.</p><p>\"We're not saying, 'Don't sit down,'\" Edwardson noted. It's about finding a better \"balance,\" she said, between sitting and moving throughout the workday.</p><p>In an accompanying journal editorial, Dr. Cindy Gray, of the University of Glasgow in Scotland, questioned the potential for health gains by simply replacing sitting with standing at work. The reason: the sit-stand desks did not lead to more potentially beneficial physical activity. </p><p>The study was funded by government and university grants.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Cancer Society has tips on <a href=\" https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/tips-for-staying-active-at-work.html\" target=\"_new\">staying active at work</a>.</p>",

The drugs change, the demographics of who's dying changes, the locations change,\" Burke said. \"You have this paradox of the overall curve is a smooth growth process, but it's composed of all these different sub-epidemics.\"</p><p>For this study, researchers collected nearly 600,000 individual reports of drug overdose deaths maintained by the U.S. National Vital Statistics System since 1979. That's the year drug overdoses began to be reported in their own category on death certificates, Burke explained.</p><p>During the past four decades, deaths from drug overdose plot as a near-perfect curve. Each year's total overdose count falls almost exactly on a smooth upward exponential curve, researchers said.</p><p>But looking closer at overdose death rates for individual drug types, which has been tracked since 1999, researchers found that what appeared to be a smooth and predictable trend was anything but.</p><p>Instead, drugs like cocaine and heroin and methamphetamine go in and out of vogue, year by year and decade by decade.</p><p>What is now known as the \"opioid epidemic\" actually started in the mid- to late-1990s, when doctors began overprescribing opioid painkillers, Burke said.</p><p>State and federal lawmakers responded by toughening restrictions on opioid prescribing. This drove people hooked on opioid painkillers to take up the cheaper option of heroin. Since then, users have migrated to even cheaper and deadlier synthetic opioids like fentanyl.</p><p>\"Particularly in the last seven or eight years, there has been a marked explosion in the number of heroin and fentanyl users,\" Burke said. Heroin also used to be confined mainly to metropolitan areas on either coast; now it's being used in small towns across the country.</p><p>The findings were published Sept. 20 in the journal <i>Science</i>.</p><p>The new study shows \"how attempts to reduce drug overdose deaths are severely undermined by our nation's failure to address addiction with effective, evidence-based prevention and treatment approaches,\" said Linda Richter, director of policy research and analysis with the Center on Addiction, a national nonprofit organization.</p><p>\"We typically focus our efforts -- most of which are underfunded and frequently not supported by scientific evidence -- on the scariest drug trend of the day, and we wait to respond until overdose deaths reach epidemic levels,\" Richter said. </p><p>\"We throw a variety of interventions at the problem and then don't bother to devote the time and resources necessary to assess whether those interventions even work,\" she said.</p><p>Why do overdose deaths continue to rise? Burke said it's likely a combination of \"push\" and \"pull\" factors on either side of the illicit drug market.</p><p>On the \"push\" side, Burke noted that innovation is on the side of drug suppliers.</p><p>\"Everything that is on the supply side helps make drugs more available,\" Burke said. \"The cost of producing the drugs is getting cheaper, the actual sales price is cheaper, the purities are increasing, the technologies for delivery, communication is easier -- and that applies not to any one drug, but to drugs across the board.\"</p><p>On the \"pull\" side, American society seems to be evolving in ways that could promote drug use.</p><p>\"There's widening economic disparity, with many people having lost a sense of purpose in daily life,\" Burke said. \"There's been a dissolution of our sense of community, particularly in small towns.</p><p>\"It raises questions about what the future is going to hold,\" Burke said. \"The main issue we raise is, if we don't address these deeper social determinants, are we really going to be able to change the trajectory of the epidemic?\"</p><p>Richter agreed that a renewed focus on prevention is needed to block this ever-rising tide.</p><p>\"A smarter, more effective approach would be to implement a comprehensive, sustained and evidence-based approach to addiction prevention, early intervention and treatment that we invest in for the long-term,\" Richter said. \"This approach would involve broad-based prevention that addresses all addictive substances and the reasons people use them, as well as significant changes in how addiction treatment is delivered in the United States.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse has more about the <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids/opioid-overdose-crisis\" target=\"_new\">opioid overdose crisis</a>.</p>",

It can't prove that variability is the cause of the heightened risk of heart attack, stroke or death, the study authors cautioned.</p><p>The researchers also didn't look at the reasons why the metabolic readings might fluctuate over time.</p><p>Treatment strategies to reduce fluctuations in these parameters, however, should be a goal to prevent bad health outcomes, Lee said.</p><p>These strategies might include keeping blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar within normal ranges -- not too high or too low -- and maintaining a normal weight -- not too fat or too thin.</p><p>Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, found these findings interesting.</p><p>\"This opens up a new avenue for accounting for variation in risk factors over time in estimating risk for cardiovascular disease,\" he said. \"Better identification of those at higher and lower risk may translate to better use of prevention strategies and therapies.\"</p><p>But further studies are needed to determine if treatment strategies that specifically reduce fluctuations in these parameters will reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and improve health, Fonarow said.</p><p>For the study, Lee and colleagues used the Korean National Health Insurance system to collect data on more than 6.7 million people who had not had heart attacks, diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol. </p><p>Between 2005 and 2012, all participants had at least three exams that documented weight, blood sugar,  blood pressure and cholesterol.</p><p>The researchers specifically looked at the effect of changes in participants whose readings went up or down more than 5 percent. Whether people's readings got better or worse didn't matter -- high variability by itself was linked to an increased  risk of death during the study period, the findings showed.</p><p>Women and older adults were more likely to have highly variable parameters, the researchers said. </p><p>Lee said because the study was done in Korea, it's not certain that these findings would apply to the United States. Other studies in different populations, however, indicate that the link between fluctuating readings and the risk of dying are common.</p><p>One specialist offered a note of caution to people who are obese or overweight not to misinterpret these findings.</p><p>\"This is provocative research that raises questions about binge dieting,\" said Dr. Byron Lee, director of electrophysiology laboratories and clinics at the University of California, San Francisco. </p><p>But it is far from definitive, he added. \"Hopefully, obese patients don't use this as an excuse to stop trying to lose weight,\" Lee said.</p><p>The report was published online Oct. 1 in the journal <i>Circulation</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/life-after-a-heart-attack/lifestyle-changes-for-heart-attack-prevention\" target=\"_new\"> American Heart Association</a> for more on heart attack prevention.</p>",

If an appliance malfunctions or is poorly vented, fumes can build up, putting people at risk. </p><p>Early symptoms of CO poisoning are often mistaken for the flu, and include headache, nausea, sleepiness, dizziness and confusion. Continued exposure can lead to coma, heart attack and death.</p><p>You should suspect CO poisoning if symptoms occur shortly after using a furnace or generator, if multiple family members get sick at the same time, or if symptoms improve outdoors.</p><p>\"At toxic levels, CO is a frequent cause of poisoning morbidity and death in the U.S., resulting in more than 50,000 emergency room visits each year,\" Henretig said.</p><p>To protect your family from CO poisoning, make sure furnaces, chimneys, wood stoves and heaters are checked regularly and are in good condition, he advised.</p><p>During power outages, gasoline-powered generators should only be used outdoors, away from vents or windows, and at least 25 feet from the house, he said. </p><p>Carbon monoxide can pose a hazard at other times, too. To curb the danger year-round, Henretig offered up the following advice:</p><ul><li>Never use gas ovens to heat your home.</li><li>Don't use barbecue grills or gasoline-powered equipment indoors or in a garage. </li><li>Don't sit in a car with the engine running if the exhaust pipe is blocked by mud or deep snow. </li><li>Install CO monitors in your home and make sure they have fresh, working batteries.</li></ul><p>If you think there is carbon monoxide in your home, open doors and windows to air it out, turn off the heating system, and call 911 or your heating company. If you suspect CO poisoning, leave the area immediately and contact the Poison Control Center or 911, Henretig said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/Features/COpoisoning/\" target=\"_new\">CO poisoning prevention</a>.</p>",

According to the doctors, when the girl had to stop taking dupilumab for two months due to a change in her insurance coverage, her newly regrown hair started to fall out. But when she started the drug treatment again, the hair growth resumed.</p><p>It's not clear how the drug is having this effect.

They said that more farms in the same area are probably connected to the outbreak.</p><p>So far, 59 people across 15 states have come down with the often severe gastrointestinal illness. Health concerns were so high that just before Thanksgiving, the FDA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked Americans to temporarily stop consuming all romaine lettuce  while they investigated the source of the outbreak.</p><p>That investigation has now pinpointed Adam Bros. as a source, experts at the FDA and CDC have said.</p><p>\"One of the samples tested by the CDC was positive for the outbreak strain by genetic fingerprinting, and was found in the sediment of an agricultural water reservoir at one ranch that is owned and operated by Adam Brothers Farming in Santa Barbara County, Calif.,\" said Dr. Stephen Ostroff, senior advisor to the FDA Commissioner.</p><p>He said the farm was cooperating with the investigation. The farm hasn't shipped romaine lettuce since Nov. 20, and Ostroff said the farm is \"committed to recalling products that may have come into contact with water from the agricultural water reservoir.\"</p><p>That said, other farms in the area might still be  implicated, so \"people should still pay close attention to where their lettuce is from,\" he added.</p><p>Because of this and other recent outbreaks, romaine lettuce now sold in the United States has labeling indicating the place and date of harvest. If heads of romaine are sold loose, without affixed labels, retailers are being asked to post a notice showing place and date of harvest near the store register.</p><p>Most romaine sold in the United States is safe to eat. Right now, precautions are limited to romaine lettuce from just a few California counties, the FDA said.</p><p>\"We continue to advise avoiding romaine lettuce from Monterey, San Benito and Santa Barbara counties in California,\" Ostroff said.</p><p>Hydroponically- and greenhouse-grown romaine also does not appear to be related to the current outbreak.</p><p>Illnesses from the E. coli O157:H7 strain implicated in this outbreak have sometimes been  severe. Although no deaths have been reported, there have 23 hospitalizations and 2 cases of kidney failure, health officials said.</p><p>\"The E. coli strain isolated from ill people in the current romaine lettuce outbreak is also closely related to the E. coli strain isolated from people in a 2017 outbreak linked to leafy green in the United States and romaine lettuce in Canada,\" noted FDA Deputy Commissioner Frank Yiannas.</p><p>So who's most at risk from E. coli?</p><p>Dr. Robert Glatter is an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City who's seen the effects of infection with the gastrointestinal bug firsthand. It's not a minor ailment, he said.</p><p>\"In general, symptoms of E. coli infection generally begin about three to four days after consuming the bacteria, and may include abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and watery or bloody diarrhea, along with fever,\" Glatter said.</p><p>And while healthy people who battle a bout of E. coli typically recover within five to seven days, the illness can be more protracted -- and even deadly -- for people already made vulnerable by chronic disease or advanced age.</p><p>\"People with diabetes, kidney disease or those with cancer or autoimmune disease run the risk of a more severe illness,\" Glatter explained.</p><p>The particular strain of E. coli detected in the current lettuce outbreak -- E. coli O157:H7 -- is particularly nasty, he noted.</p><p>\"Most strains of E. coli do not actually cause diarrhea, but E. coli O157 produces a powerful toxin that injures the inner lining of the small intestine, leading to bloody diarrhea,\" Glatter said. Even a tiny amount of ingested bacteria could spur this type of illness.</p><p>\"It can make people much more ill, and may lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure, in some cases,\" he said.</p><p>In many cases, antibiotics are used to help beat back an E. coli infection, but these drugs can affect the kidneys, Glatter noted.</p><p>\"Antibiotics may be necessary in certain cases, so it's important to see your doctor if you have continued and severe symptoms such as fever, bloody diarrhea, and you are not able to eat or drink,\" he said.</p><p>However, in the case of E. coli O157:H7, \"taking antibiotics may actually increase your risk of developing kidney failure, so it's important to speak with your health care provider if you should develop severe symptoms,\" Glatter advised.</p><p>And if you do think you might be sick with E. coli, or any other foodborne illness, make sure you don't spread it to those near you.</p><p>The bacterium \"can be transmitted person-to-person, so it's vital that anyone who is potentially infected wash their hands thoroughly and not share utensils, cups or glasses,\" Glatter said. \"This also goes for bath towels. Linens also need to be washed in hot water and treated with bleach.\"</p><p>He noted that \"ground beef, unpasteurized milk, fresh produce and contaminated water are common sources of E. coli bacteria.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Find out more about E. coli illness at the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/ecoli-symptoms.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

If you prefer a live tree, choose one with fresh, green needles that don't break easily. Water trees often to ensure they don't dry out.</p><p>Avoid using candles, but if you do, keep them at least 12 inches from anything flammable and 3 feet from your live Christmas tree, the fire administration advises.</p><p>When cooking, keep anything that can catch on fire -- such as pot holders, wooden utensils, paper or plastic bags, food packaging and towels  -- away from stove tops and ovens, safety experts say.</p><p>Also, always keep an eye on things in the kitchen. Unattended cooking is the leading cause of kitchen fires, according to the National Fire Protection Association.</p><p>\"If you're sleepy or have consumed alcohol, don't use the stove or stovetop,\" Emmons said. \"Plus, always stay in the kitchen when you're cooking food; if you leave the kitchen at all, be sure to turn off the stove and move anything that can catch fire away from it.\"</p><p>Space heaters are another potential fire hazard. They're involved in nearly 80 percent of fatal home fires, according to the association.</p><p>Nearly half of all space heater fires involve electric space heaters. Be sure electric heaters have automatic shut-off tip-over protection, and always plug them directly into a wall outlet, rather than an extension cord. Unplug them when you leave a room or go to sleep.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Fire Administration has more on <a href=\"https://www.usfa.fema.gov/prevention/outreach/holiday.html\" target=\"_new\">holiday fire safety</a>.</p>",

Many farmers' market vendors don't follow food safety practices meant to prevent the spread of foodborne illnesses, a new study found.</p><p>Researchers used direct observation, state health inspector reports and vendor input to assess food safety practices at farmers' markets in Pennsylvania.</p><p>\"We found that our direct field observations and inspector findings were very similar, yet very different from what most vendors said they were doing,\" said Cathy Cutter, a professor of food science at Penn State University.</p><p>\"There was a chasm, if you will, between what we and the inspectors saw, and what vendors reported they were doing. The vendors think they are doing a good job, when in reality they are not,\" she said in a university news release. </p><p>\"We are not sure why there were such discrepancies. Nevertheless, they need to do better,\" said Cutter, who's also assistant director of food safety and quality programs for Penn State Extension.</p><p>With more than 8,500 farmers' markets in the United States, food safety risks have risen, the researchers explained.</p><p>Areas where vendors in the study fell short included hand-washing, personal hygiene and cross-contamination.

Here we showed that this may be true in humans, too,\" said study author Lorenzo Fabrizi of University College London.</p><p>His team measured the brain waves of 19 newborns during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The babies were an average of 2 days old, and some were premature. The researchers found a link between movement and brain activity.</p><p>For example, movement of a newborn's right hand causes immediate activity in the left part of the brain that processes touch for the right hand. The size of these \"fast brain waves\" is largest in premature babies, who would normally still be in the womb, the researchers said.</p><p>The fast brain waves associated with movement end by the time a baby is a few weeks old, the researchers added.</p><p>These findings suggest that fetal movement in the third trimester of pregnancy helps to develop areas of the brain that process sensory input. This is how a baby develops a sense of its own body, according to the study authors.</p><p>The research could improve care for premature infants, Fabrizi and his colleagues said in a university news release.</p><p>\"We think the findings have implications for providing the optimal hospital environment for infants born early, so that they receive appropriate sensory input,\" said study co-author Kimberley Whitehead. She's in the university's department of neuroscience, physiology and pharmacology.</p><p>For example, it's already routine for infants to be \"nested\" in their bassinets. This allows them to \"feel\" a surface when they kick their limbs, as if they were still inside the womb, Whitehead noted.</p><p>\"As the movements we observed occur during sleep, our results support other studies which indicate that sleep should be protected in newborns, for example by minimizing the disturbance associated with necessary medical procedures,\" Whitehead said.</p><p>The findings were published Nov. 30 in the journal <i>Scientific Reports</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Pregnancy Association has more on <a href=\"http://americanpregnancy.org/while-pregnant/first-fetal-movement/\" target=\"_new\">fetal movement</a>.</p>",

Bush, had battled numerous health issues over the past few years, including a form of Parkinson's disease, <i>The New York Times</i> reported.</p><p>His death comes less than eight months after that of his wife of 73 years, Barbara. Over the past few years, Bush's Parkinson's had forced him to use a motorized scooter for mobility. He also had numerous health crises - in April, he was hospitalized with a serious infection just a day after his wife's funeral, and in 2013 he battled a near-fatal bout of bronchitis.</p><p>Bush, whose term as President ran from 1989 to 1993, hailed originally from Connecticut and was the son of banker and two-term U.S. Senator Prescott Bush.</p><p>He was a decorated Navy pilot in World War II and attended Yale University. Bush met and married the former Barbara Pierce in 1944, and in 1948 the family moved to Texas, where he'd begun a career in the oil business. From that point forward, the Bushes became strongly identified with the Lone Star state.</p><p>Bush's nearly 40 years of public service began in 1963, when, alarmed by a potential far right takeover of local Republican politics, he ran for and won the leadership of the Harris County Republican committee.  He eventually made his way to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1966, representing a wealthy district in Houston.</p><p>By the early 1970s Bush was a fixture in the Nixon White House, becoming ambassador to the United Nations in 1971. He then headed the Republican National Committee during perhaps one of the GOP's most trying times: Watergate and its aftermath.</p><p>During the Gerald Ford presidency, Bush was picked to head the CIA. His political career had a lull during President Jimmy Carter's term, but Bush again rose to national prominence as President Ronald Reagan's two-term vice president during the 1980s.</p><p>By the end of Reagan's tenure, Bush was ready to take a long-sought shot at the Presidency: he beat Democrat Michael Dukakis and installed Indiana senator Dan Quayle as his vice president.</p> <p>Bush's presidential term is perhaps best remembered for the first Gulf War, sparked by an invasion of oil-rich Kuwait by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. \"Vital issues of principle are at stake,\"Bush told Congress on Sept. 11, 1990. \"Saddam Hussein is literally trying to wipe a country off the face of the earth.\"</p><p>Backed by a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing force if Iraq did not withdraw, as well as bipartisan support in Congress, Bush ordered American forces to bomb Baghdad on Jan. 16, 1991. \"Our goal is not the conquest of Iraq, it is the liberation of Kuwait,\"Bush told the nation in a televised address.</p><p>The ground war was short - 100 hours - and the Iraqi army fled, with Hussein remaining in power.\"We were disappointed [at leaving Hussein in place], but I still do not regret my decision to end the war when we did,\" Bush said.</p><p>Bush weathered other political storms, such as turmoil in the former Soviet Union and the much-contested appointment of U.S. Supreme Court judge Clarence Thomas.

            "Body__c": "<!--Spanish ID: 740237 --><p>SUNDAY, Dec. 2, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The risk of sudden unexpected death in people with epilepsy can change over time, and it usually changes for the better, a new study reports. </p><p>In what the researchers are calling hopeful news, the study found that people who have a medium or high risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) often don't remain at the same risk level. </p><p>\"This analysis shows that there is hope. If you're low-risk, you're likely to stay that way. If you're in a higher risk, that's likely to change,\" said the study's senior author, Dr. Daniel Goldenholz. He's an instructor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School in Boston. </p><p>The study's lead author, Dr. Neishay Ayub, said researchers \"would like patients to get evaluations for their risk of SUDEP each year and be treated and counseled appropriately about that risk.\" </p><p>Ayub, a clinical fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, said the study wasn't able to tease out why risk levels changed, but one reason may be a change in epilepsy treatment. Fewer seizures per year lower the risk of SUDEP, according to the researchers. </p><p>SUDEP refers to deaths in epilepsy patients that aren't related to injury, drowning or other known causes. Most cases of SUDEP occur during or soon after a seizure, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Possible causes include pauses in breathing, abnormal heart rhythms or a combination of those factors. </p><p>About one to two cases a year of SUDEP occur for every 1,000 people with epilepsy, the CDC says. Known risks include frequent seizures and having generalized convulsive seizures (also known as grand mal or tonic-clonic seizures). </p><p> \"SUDEP is rare in the sense of your risk per year, but if you have epilepsy for 30 years, the risk is substantial,\" said Dr. Shlomo Shinnar, president of the American Epilepsy Society.</p><p>He said the good news is that progress is being made. \"We're doing a better job of identifying risk factors and looking at ways to modify the risk of SUDEP,\" he added.</p><p>But Goldenholz, Ayub and colleagues thought patients needed more information.</p><p> \"One of the things we saw that was kind of scary is that although we can tell people what their risk is, there was no long-term outlook. Will this risk always be very high? Will it always be low?\" Goldenholz said. </p><p>To answer those questions, the researchers reviewed data from more than 1.4 million seizures reported by 12,402 people with epilepsy. The seizures were recorded in an app called \"Seizure Tracker.\" </p><p>Researchers looked at the number of seizures a year each person had. People with zero were placed in the low-risk category. </p><p>Those who had one or two generalized seizures each year were considered medium-risk. And people who had three or more generalized seizures annually were considered at high risk of SUDEP. </p><p>After three years, about 41 percent of those in the high-risk group remained in that category and just 5 percent in the medium-risk category stayed in the same risk group, researchers found. More than 77 percent of those considered low-risk remained in that category after three years. </p><p>Shinnar said the study has some limitations. One is that seizure data is self-reported by patients. Another is that none of the people actually had a SUDEP event, making it difficult to capture the actual risk, he said. </p><p>The goal, Shinnar said, is for patients to be seizure-free.</p><p> \"If you're seizure-free, we eliminate the risk of SUDEP essentially. If you're seizure-free, you have an extraordinarily low risk of SUDEP,\" Shinnar said. </p><p>Results of the study were scheduled to be presented Sunday at the American Epilepsy Society annual meeting, in New Orleans. Findings presented at meetings are typically considered preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about  <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/about/sudep/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">sudden unexpected death in epilepsy</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Dec. 3, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Yet another study reveals that autism is far more common than once thought, with nearly 3 percent of American children diagnosed with the disorder.</p><p>A federal study published last week reported that one in 40 children have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and a second study that was published online  Dec. 3 in the journal <i>JAMA Pediatrics</i> arrived at the same conclusion. Previously, it was estimated that one in 59 children have autism.</p><p>More troubling was that Dr. Wei Bao, lead researcher on the second study, found that 30 percent of kids who are diagnosed aren't getting treatment.</p><p>\"We know that autism may have lifetime impact to the individual and the family,\" said Bao, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Iowa. \"There should be efforts to reduce the number of those untreated to as low as possible.\"</p><p>It's not clear who did and did not receive treatment, Bao added. It might be that untreated children have a very mild form of autism, he noted.</p><p>\"Because the rate of autism keeps increasing, more and more children need treatment, and many may be waiting to see a doctor,\" Bao said.  </p><p>The reasons more kids are identified with autism  are unclear, Bao said. He speculated that it's probably a combination of a real increase in the condition coupled with better diagnosis and changing definitions of autism that have identified more forms of the disease. </p><p>Autism spectrum disorder covers a wide range of behaviors that affect a child's social and communication skills. It's often marked by difficulty communicating, engaging in repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. In its most serious manifestation, children can be nonverbal and appear cut off from the world. Many children, however, have less severe forms of autism and are able to function in school and in social situations. </p><p>Autism is often treated with medications that help alleviate symptoms, and also behavioral therapy. Nearly 64 percent of children with the disorder in the study received behavioral treatment, and 27 percent took medications, Bao's team found. </p><p>The researchers also found geographic differences in where autism is more or less common. Bao isn't sure why these disparities exist -- it might be due to the prevalence of diagnosis, differences in racial and ethnic groups, or environmental triggers, he suggested.</p><p>For the study, Bao and colleagues collected data on 43,000 children who took part in the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health. The investigators found that 2.8 percent of the children had been diagnosed with autism. The same database was mined in the earlier government study.</p><p> Thomas Frazier is chief science officer for Autism Speaks, an autism advocacy organization. He said, \"The one in 40 number from this study shows that ASD is common, and contributes to data indicating that autism prevalence continues to increase.\" </p><p>Autism is and should continue to be a public health priority, he said, so \"we need to understand why the prevalence is increasing.\" </p><p>This study and earlier studies have shown that many children with autism are not being identified as early as they could be, Frazier added. \"Even when children are identified early, many have difficulty accessing treatments and services,\" he said.</p><p>Several things can be done to improve this situation, Frazier suggested. For example, better access to treatment is needed, especially in areas where the availability of services is limited. In addition, parents need training in techniques that have been shown to be effective in improving the developmental abilities of children with autism. </p><p>Frazier also said that health insurance needs to cover autism treatment, and public funding is needed to cover treatment for the uninsured.</p><p>Importantly, he said, \"families need to be connected to interventions and other supports as soon as a developmental condition is identified.\" </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about <a href=\" https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/index.html \" target=\"_new\">autism</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Jan. 4, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- More than 10 percent of U.S. adults have a food allergy -- and nearly double that believe they do, a new study estimates.</p><p>Researchers found that 19 percent of those surveyed thought they had a food allergy. But when the investigators dug into people's symptoms, they found that only 10.8 percent reported \"convincing\" signs of a true allergy.</p><p>Experts said the findings highlight two important facts: Food allergies are common among U.S. adults, and many mistakenly believe they have one.</p><p>\"There are many misconceptions around reactions to food,\" said lead researcher Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University, in Chicago.</p><p>According to Gupta, it can be easy for people to assume food-related symptoms signal an allergy. But other conditions can be the real culprit, she said.</p><p>People with true allergies have an immune system reaction against proteins in a particular food. Those reactions, Gupta explained, can sometimes be severe -- including life-threatening breathing difficulties or drops in blood pressure.</p><p>So it's critical to get an accurate diagnosis, she noted.</p><p>Dr. Wayne Shreffler, a medical advisor to the non-profit Food Allergy Research &amp; Education, agreed.</p><p>\"Sometimes people think, 'What difference does it make? If the food makes me feel bad, I'll avoid it,'\" Shreffler said.</p><p>But people with a true allergy need to completely eliminate the offending food from their diet -- and they should get professional guidance on how to do that, he suggested.</p><p>They should also get a prescription for epinephrine, Shreffler said. The drug, given by auto-injector, treats severe allergic reactions in an emergency.</p><p>On the flip side, food avoidance can be very challenging -- so people without an allergy should not do it unnecessarily, he added.</p><p>What other conditions can cause food-related woes? One possibility, Gupta said, is a food intolerance -- such as difficulty digesting lactose, a sugar in milk.</p><p>Unlike allergies, food intolerances do not involve the immune system. They arise from an issue in the digestive system -- like an enzyme deficiency -- that makes it hard to break down a particular food.</p><p>In other cases, Gupta said, people have an oral allergy syndrome. That occurs when someone with a pollen allergy has a reaction to a food with proteins similar to pollen -- usually a raw fruit or vegetable. The symptoms include itchiness in the mouth or throat, or swelling around the lips.</p><p>That type of reaction is not life-threatening, and people may be able to avert it by simply cooking the offending produce, Gupta said.</p><p>The study, published online Jan. 4 in <i>JAMA Network Open</i>, included more than 40,400 U.S. adults.</p><p>Overall, 19 percent reported food allergies. However, only 10.8 percent had ever suffered \"convincing\" symptoms -- such as hives, throat constriction, lip or tongue swelling, vomiting, difficulty breathing or rapid heartbeat.</p><p>Certain other symptoms -- like cramps or diarrhea -- were not considered convincing, because they are more likely to indicate a food intolerance.</p><p>Among people with true allergies, shellfish was the most common culprit: An estimated 3 percent of adults were allergic to shellfish. Milk allergy (1.9 percent) and peanut allergy (1.8 percent) were next in line. Many people had more than one food allergy, the findings showed.</p><p>And surprisingly, allergies often developed in adulthood, rather than childhood. Almost half of participants with convincing symptoms developed at least one of their allergies as an adult, according to the report.</p><p>It has long been known that adults can develop new food allergies. But Gupta was \"really surprised\" by how often that was reported in the study.</p><p>Shreffler agreed, calling the finding \"striking.\"</p><p>It's not fully clear why food allergies arise in adults, according to Shreffler. But in some cases, he said, it may be a matter of exposure. Many kids turn their noses up at shellfish, for example -- so an allergy might not become apparent until later in life.</p><p>Gupta's team also found that only half of study participants with convincing food allergy symptoms had ever received a formal diagnosis.</p><p>Some may self-diagnose and skip the doctor visit, both Gupta and Shreffler said. But it's also possible for doctors to miss the diagnosis.</p><p>\"I think that finding is a bit of a wake-up call to the medical community,\" Shreffler said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Food Allergy Research &amp; Education has more on <a href=\"https://www.foodallergy.org/life-with-food-allergies/food-allergy-101/diagnosis-testing\" target=\"_new\">food allergy diagnosis</a>.</p>",

But many of the millions with the lung condition don't get it, researchers report.</p><p>COPD causes inflammation in the lungs and it can flare up when triggered by the flu, making the infection worse, explained lead researcher Dr. Sunita Mulpuru. She is an associate scientist at Ottawa Hospital in Canada.</p><p>Not only is the flu bad, but other  complications, such as pneumonia, can be even worse, she added.</p><p>\"Approximately one in 10 pass away, and one in five develop critical illness requiring admission to the intensive care unit [in a hospital],\" Mulpuru said. </p><p>But getting a flu shot lowers the odds of being hospitalized for flu-related illness by 38 percent, her team discovered.</p><p>\"Despite that finding, only 66 percent of the patients in this study were vaccinated,\" Mulpuru noted.</p><p>In addition, the antiviral medications Tamiflu and Relenza, which can make flu less severe, were only used 69 percent of the time, the findings showed. Moreover, the drugs weren't given early in the hospital, when they can be most effective, she said. </p><p>These drugs were most often given when patients were headed to the intensive care unit, \"which is too late,\" Mulpuru said.</p><p>Dr. MeiLan Han, a spokeswoman for the American Lung Association and a professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, said more COPD patients need to get vaccinated. </p><p>\"There are a lot of misconceptions out there,\" Han said. \"I hear things like 'I've never had the flu, so I don't think I'll ever get it,' which is a bit of a falsehood.\"</p><p>Many people don't understand the flu is much worse than a bad cold and can be life-threatening, she noted. \"In the best case, you feel deathly miserable for a week or two,\" Han said.</p><p>Some patients fear that they can get the flu from the vaccine. But that simply isn't so, she added.</p><p>Although it's too early to tell how bad this year's flu season will be, the last season sent nearly one million Americans to the hospital and killed 80,000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>For the study, Mulpuru and colleagues collected data on nearly 4,200 COPD patients hospitalized for acute respiratory illness.</p><p>After checking their flu vaccination status, the investigators found that COPD patients who had a flu shot were 38 percent less likely to be hospitalized for flu-related illness. </p><p>Moreover, COPD patients with the flu were more likely to die than those without the disease (10 percent versus 8 percent). These patients were also more likely to be critically ill (17 percent versus 12 percent), the findings showed.</p><p>Patients most at risk were those over age 75, those with heart disease and those who needed to use oxygen at home, the researchers reported.</p><p>The report was published in the January issue of the journal <i>Chest</i>. </p><p> Dr. Len Horovitz is a pulmonary specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He said, \"This 01217000000c1gRAAQs what doctors always tell patients in trying to 'sell' the flu shot.\" </p> <p>Vaccination does reduce hospitalization in patients with COPD who contract influenza, Horovitz said.</p><p>\"It follows that a milder attack of flu will not generate as many complications necessitating hospitalization,\" he added. \"That's a great benefit of vaccination, even when the flu breaks through the vaccination barrier.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on COPD, visit the <a href=\"https://www.lung.org/lung-health-and-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/copd\" target=\"_new\">American Lung Association</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Oct. 22, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Paying extra for those pricey organic fruits and  vegetables might pay off: New research suggests eating them might help you dodge a cancer diagnosis.</p><p>People who consumed the most organic foods had a 25 percent lower cancer risk compared with those who ate the least, the study found.</p><p>Specifically, eating more organically grown foods was linked to a 34 percent reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, a 76 percent decreased risk for all lymphomas and an 86 percent reduced risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, said lead researcher Julia Baudry. She is a scientist with the Center for Research and Epidemiology and Statistics at the Sorbonne Paris Cite.</p><p>\"If our findings are confirmed, organic food consumption may contribute to cancer prevention,\" Baudry said, though the study did not prove they directly caused cancer risk to drop.</p><p>And people shouldn't stop eating fruits and vegetables if they can't afford more expensive organically grown options.</p><p>Filling your diet with fruits and vegetables is known to reduce your risk of chronic disease and cancer, regardless of whether or not they're organic, Baudry and other experts said.</p><p> Mark Guinter, a postdoctoral fellow with the American Cancer Society, said, \"More importantly than anything is making sure you consume your fruits and vegetables, avoid your red and processed meat, and eat whole grains. Those are established relationships with cancer, replicated in multiple populations.\"</p><p> Guinter added that  \"if people are interested in changing their diets or buying foods that are known to help prevent their cancer risk, those would certainly be avenues to take rather than simply buying organic.\"</p><p>For this study, Baudry and her colleagues analyzed data from nearly 69,000 people taking part in an ongoing French study of the associations between nutrition and health.</p><p>The participants all filled out questionnaires regarding their consumption of organic products. These included fruits and vegetables, dairy, meat and fish, eggs, breads and other foods.</p><p>They also filled out annual questionnaires regarding the status of their health, including instances of cancer, and were followed for 4.5 years on average.</p><p>The researchers found an association between eating organic foods and lower cancer risk, even after taking into account other risk factors for cancer.</p><p>\"We did consider a variety of factors that may be involved in the relationship,\" Baudry said, \"such as sociodemographic, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, as well as family history of cancer, or healthier diet in terms of nutrients and food consumption. Controlling for these factors did not substantially modify the findings.\"</p><p>Organic foods are grown without pesticides, fertilizers and other chemicals. Studies have shown that people who eat organic foods have lower levels of pesticide residue in their urine, she noted.</p><p>\"Exposure to pesticide has been associated with higher cancer risk\" in previous studies, Baudry said.</p><p>Specifically, Guinter said, this study supports results from a British study that also found an association between organic food consumption and lower risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</p><p>\"Whenever you see a result that's replicated like that, you find it a little more believable. There's good biologic plausibility behind it,\" Guinter explained.</p><p>According to Dr. Frank Hu, chair of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, animal studies have shown that pesticides can increase DNA damage, which can increase risk of cancer. Chemicals also can disrupt the endocrine system.</p><p>But, Guinter and Hu said, there's not enough human evidence yet upon which to base any new dietary recommendations.</p><p>People should eat right and maintain a healthy weight through diet and exercise to prevent cancer, Hu said. Cutting back on alcohol also will help.</p><p>\"Basically, increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables, whether conventional or organic, can improve overall diet quality and reduce your risk of chronic disease, including cancer,\" said Hu, senior author of an editorial accompanying the new study.</p><p>The report was published online Oct. 22 in <i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Cancer Society has more about <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/healthy/eat-healthy-get-active/acs-guidelines-nutrition-physical-activity-cancer-prevention/common-questions.html\" target=\"_new\">diet and cancer risk</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Oct. 30, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Swimmer extraordinaire Michael Phelps has won 28 Olympic medals -- 23 of them gold. Yet, despite all those medals and the accolades that came with them, Phelps has struggled with depression and anxiety. </p><p>In 2014, it got so bad that he locked himself in his bedroom and stayed there for days.</p><p>\"During those days, I had thoughts of not wanting to be alive,\" Phelps said. \"The longer I stayed in my room by myself, I thought there has to be another way.\" </p><p>That's when Phelps checked himself in for inpatient mental health treatment.</p><p>\"As an athlete, I learned that we're supposed to be these big macho people that don't have any problems, and we're not supposed to show weakness, but that's so wrong. I'm so thankful that I can ask for help now,\" he explained.</p><p>Phelps spoke of his inner struggles as the keynote speaker at a recent New York City conference held by Talkspace, an online counseling service. </p> <p>The famed athlete holds the all-time record for an individual with the most Olympic gold medals. He announced his retirement from swimming in 2016. </p> <p>\"I have spent my whole life submerged in water. I ate, slept and swam. That's really all I did my whole life. I'm really just learning how to live now, and it's frustrating at times. But it's also rewarding,\" Phelps said. </p><p>He's also learned that depression and anxiety will be ongoing challenges for him.</p><p>\"You don't go through a depression spell one day and have it go away. Therapy helps me sharpen my tools to be prepared for whatever comes my way,\" Phelps said.</p><p>\"I've gone through multiple stages of depression, and I deal with anxiety all the time. There are lots of people struggling with the exact same things, so if I can get one message out there, it's that 'It's OK not to be OK,' \" he said. </p><p>Phelps explained that therapy is helping him continually learn how to be as healthy as he can be mentally.</p><p>\"I know there are some things that have to happen throughout the day. For me, a workout is so important. It's something I have to do, and if I don't, I'm an absolute nightmare. As soon as I work out, I can relax a little bit,\" he said.</p><p>Phelps also makes sure he communicates openly with people, especially his wife, Nicole. </p><p>\"Throughout my career, I got very good at compartmentalizing and stuffing things away and not dealing with any of it. I finally learned to communicate at 30 in therapy,\" he said. </p><p>He also makes sure he always has access to his therapist. \"I've picked up the things that work for me, because I want to be a better father, a better husband and a better friend,\" he said. </p><p>Dr. Richard Catanzaro, chairman of psychiatry at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y., said it helps reduce some of the stigma of mental illness when someone like Phelps comes forward. It also helps people realize that anyone can get depressed. </p><p>\"Everyone has their own internal struggles. Everyone is measuring up to a vision of themselves, and most people can't take on the perspective of everyone around them. When you start to make those comparisons, like, 'Why should <i>you</i> be depressed when you have everything,' you make the person feel guilty and invalidated,\" he noted.</p><p>\"It's absolutely possible to be outwardly successful and be inwardly very depressed and anxious. What people see are artificial indications of success -- money, career or extraordinary athletic feats. But that's not an indication of a whole life,\" Catanzaro said.</p><p>And, that's one of the things Phelps said he'd love for people to know about him. </p><p>\"I'm a human being. What I did in the water doesn't define who I am as a person. I think everybody only thinks of me as a swimmer, and not as an individual, and that's frustrating,\" Phelps explained. </p><p>He said people seem to think he's superhuman. But, he said, \"I was very passionate about what I did and I never gave up. That's why everything happened the way it did in my career.\" </p><p>Today, Phelps said helping other people realize that they're not alone, and that it's OK to ask for help, is what really brings him joy. </p><p>\"People come up to me and share their stories and their struggles, and for me, that's the greatest thing in the world. A chance to save a life is better than winning any gold medals,\" he said. </p><p>Catanzaro said symptoms of depression are different for different people. But some of the signs to look out for include changes in sleeping or eating patterns; a change in mood; not finding pleasure or finding very little pleasure in anything; and feelings of wanting to end your life -- whether actively thinking of ways to kill yourself or even just wishing that you wouldn't wake up.</p><p>If you're suicidal, call a suicide hotline or 911 right away, Catanzaro said. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about depression from the <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression/index.shtml\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institute of Mental Health</a>.</p>",

He wasn't involved in the new study, but is familiar with \"AGE\" chemicals as natural indicators of health.</p><p>\"What's a good example of an AGE that everyone can recognize? On Thanksgiving we put a turkey in the oven with the goal of having a beautiful bird with beautiful browned skin. That browning occurs because of the AGEs in the turkey skin,\" Bernstein noted.</p><p>He explained that in live humans, these proteins \"stick to each other and form a web, and this web is an AGE. The formation of AGEs contribute to the complications of diabetes.\"</p><p>Because AGEs can gradually increase over time, doctors might someday \"easily screen whole populations by the fluorescent technique to identify who has AGEs and is therefore at risk,\" Bernstein said.</p><p>A heart specialist agreed. Dr. Guy Mintz called the study \"impressive,\" and said devices like the AGE Reader \"could be a game-changer in cardiovascular and diabetic risk assessment.\" He directs cardiovascular health at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y.</p><p>Mintz said studies where the AGE Reader was used on a patient's skin before and after medical treatments would be interesting \"to see if the pattern of skin autofluorescence changes with medical and lifestyle interventions.\"</p><p>However, Mintz did have one reservation: \"I do not agree with the author's [notion] that this technology can be used in nonclinical settings, such as pharmacies, to assess patients' risk.\" He said non-physicians could easily misinterpret test results and that might harm, not help, patients.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Diabetes Association offers more on <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/\" target=\"_new\">diabetes</a>.</p>",

It was only when family members stopped smoking marijuana at home that his breathing got better, according to his doctor.</p><p>The boy's case shows that exposure to secondhand pot smoke can worsen asthma in children who have a marijuana allergy, a new study reports.</p><p>The child's relatives frequently smoked marijuana in the house, said Dr. Bryce Hoffman, lead author of the report.</p><p>\"Even though family members didn't smoke marijuana in the same room as the child, he was exposed to traces of smoke and plant material,\" explained Hoffman, an allergy and immunology specialist in Denver.</p><p>\"It was not clear why his asthma was so severe and not responding to aggressive asthma therapies until we determined he was allergic to cannabis. After the cannabis was removed from the house, his asthma improved,\" Hoffman said in a news release from the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI). </p><p>The case study also said that the boy's grandmother had a history of hives after personal use of marijuana.</p><p>\"Although the boy didn't have any clear allergic symptoms such as hives -- like his grandmother -- we know indoor allergens like pets and dust mites can make asthma worse without obvious allergic symptoms,\" Hoffman said.</p><p>This type of trigger is different from secondhand tobacco smoke, which worsens asthma by irritating the lungs in a non-allergic way, he explained.</p><p>\"The takeaway is that cannabis allergy can make asthma worse even without direct use. Anyone using cannabis needs to consider that others living in their house who have asthma -- particularly children -- may be at risk of uncontrolled asthma,\" Hoffman said.</p><p>Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition. If you have asthma, your airways become inflamed and swell, making it difficult to breathe.</p><p>The study was presented recently at the annual ACAAI meeting, in Seattle.

A possible reason for this could be that women with OSA are more vulnerable to cardiac alterations.\"</p> <p>Loud snoring is a hallmark of obstructive sleep apnea, which affects between 3 percent and 7 percent of adults in the United States, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Also characterized by brief periods where breathing stops, often followed by gasping for air, sleep apnea is becoming recognized as a contributor to serious health conditions, such as high blood pressure, heart disease and poor blood sugar metabolism.</p><p>Sleep apnea treatment depends on the cause. Treatments include surgery to open narrowed upper airways or using a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine while sleeping.</p><p>Curta and his colleagues evaluated data from the UK Biobank, which follows the health and well-being of 500,000 volunteers. The researchers  looked at data from nearly 4,500 participants who underwent cardiac imaging. These study volunteers were split into three groups: 38 with obstructive sleep apnea; 1,919 who reported snoring; and 2,536 without OSA or snoring.</p><p>In both men and women, those with sleep apnea and snoring tended to have larger left ventricles of the heart, meaning the walls were enlarged and the heart was working harder to pump, Curta said.</p><p>But when the snoring group was compared to the unaffected group, a more significant difference was found in the size of the left ventricle among women compared to men. These cardiac changes in self-reported snorers suggest earlier heart impairment in women and could point to undiagnosed sleep apnea, he said.</p> <p>The findings suggest the transition from snoring to obstructive sleep apnea is an evolving process linked to a potentially dangerous enlargement of the left ventricle. But the research did not prove that sleep apnea causes heart changes, only that an association exists between the two.</p><p>Curta noted that researchers are still uncertain why snoring would remodel women's hearts more quickly than men's. More research needs to be done to understand this process, he said.</p><p>\"The most important clinical implication is that we need better prevention for OSA, such as a broader information program,\" Curta said. \"Individuals with snoring should ask someone to observe them during sleep if they show periods of breathing cessation.\"</p><p>Those who do stop breathing while sleeping should undergo a sleep study to determine how advanced their sleep apnea is and the proper treatment, Curta said.</p><p>Dr. Tetyana Kendzerska is a sleep physician at Ottawa Hospital Sleep Center in Canada, and wasn't involved in the new research. Since obesity is a known contributor to snoring and sleep apnea, Kendzerska said losing excess weight is encouraged for those with snoring or sleep apnea.</p> <p>\"We know that men and women report different symptoms for OSA, and as a result, obstructive sleep apnea is seriously underreported and underdiagnosed in women,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Given that potential cardiovascular risk associated with sleep apnea may be greater in women than in men, first we need to identify women with sleep apnea [by] increasing awareness among health care professionals,\" Kendzerska added.</p> <p>The research was to be presented Thursday at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America, in Chicago. Research presented at meetings typically hasn't been peer-reviewed or published, and results are considered preliminary.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more on <a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Sleep-Apnea-Information-Page\" target=\"_new\">sleep apnea</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p> TUESDAY, Oct. 23, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- A child's blood pressure could indicate cognition problems into adulthood, according to a new study suggesting the cardiovascular connection to cognitive decline could begin much earlier in life than previously believed.</p> <p> The findings may provide a window into the roots of dementia, for which high blood pressure is considered a risk factor.</p> <p>\"We wondered is there perhaps some signal early in life that tells us high blood pressure is bad for you throughout your entire life?\" said Dr. Arfan Ikram, lead author of the Dutch study published Oct. 23 in the <i>Journal of the American Heart Association.</i></p> <p> It looked at a group of 5,853 children and 5,187 adults. The average age was about 6 among the kids and 62 for adults. Researchers assessed each participant's blood pressure and arterial stiffness, which is the loss of elasticity in arteries and often considered a sign of aging, vascular disease or both.</p> <p> They also examined cognitive function for both groups. The children were given a set of non-verbal assessments of their abstract reasoning and spatial visualization skills. The results were converted to an IQ score. Adults took five cognition tests that measured a broader range of aptitudes ranging from memory to mental dexterity.</p> <p> The condition of blood vessels played a role in the results for both groups -- but in different ways. Among adults, greater arterial stiffness and higher blood pressure were associated with lower cognition. In children, higher diastolic blood pressure -- the bottom number in a blood pressure reading -- was linked with lower IQ scores.</p> <p> But Ikram cautioned this association was a subtle one.</p> <p>\"This doesn't mean we now need to start doing some kind of intervention at that age,\" said Ikram, chair of the epidemiology department at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. \"What the findings really mean is that we can say, 'Hey, the origins of when blood pressure might start affecting the brain lies really early in life.' \"</p> <p> The American Heart Association recommends children have their blood pressure checked once a year. For adults, the recommendation is at least once every two years if blood pressure is normal and more often if it's above normal.</p> <p> Ikram said parents and adults in general should make prevention a priority.</p> <p>\"For instance, you can make sure blood pressure doesn't increase through lifestyle interventions, especially regular physical activity or reduced salt intake,\" he said. \"We really need to make sure such things start early in life and not when people are, say, 40 or 50 years of age and thinking, 'I need to make sure my health is maintained, because I'm starting to suffer from various ailments.' \"</p> <p> About 50 million people worldwide have dementia, with nearly 10 million new cases each year, according to the World Health Organization. </p> <p> Past studies have found links to high blood pressure and other cardiovascular risks.</p> <p>Most related research focuses on older adults, although some emerging studies include data on middle-aged patients, said Angela Jefferson, a neurology professor and director of the Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer's Center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.</p> <p>\"The inclusion of a younger population of children taken together with the middle-aged adults offers interesting information about how blood pressure and arterial health relate to brain health,\" said Jefferson, who was not involved in the study.</p> <p> The use of different cognition tests for the two study groups makes it a little difficult to compare the results exactly, she said. But \"because children's brains continue to develop until the late teens, we use different tests to assess their cognitive health.\"</p> <p> What's more significant is tracking the \"precise timing of when aging and disease affect the body's arterial blood supply\" and the impact that has on the brain, Jefferson said.</p> <p>\"If we can pinpoint the window of intervention, we can make a stronger effort to improve cardiovascular health and reduce complications on brain health, cognition and presumably dementia,\" she said.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 16, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- As part of a new effort to cut the use of dogs in drug trials, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday launched an initiative to keep canines out of studies for certain veterinary medicines.</p><p>The project is aimed at \"bioequivalence\" trials -- studies conducted to test whether a new generic version of a drug is equivalent in effectiveness and safety to an existing medicine.</p><p>Often, these drug tests involve live dogs who are treated with the drug and then euthanized and autopsied, to examine how the medicine affected tissues and organs.</p><p>But under the new plan, such trials may become obsolete, FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in an agency news release.</p><p>\"Our goal is to do one single study involving a small number of dogs where the dogs will only be subject to minimally invasive blood sampling, and adopted as pets at the completion of the short trial -- to eliminate the need for the use of dogs in certain types of future studies, some where they might have been euthanized,\" Gottlieb explained.</p><p>The new research is aimed at validating that approach, so that bioequivalency studies could dispense with the need to use live canines.</p><p> Gottlieb said the move away from live animals would be especially important for the testing of veterinary medicines like anti-parasite drugs, which need to be absorbed internally.</p><p>\"For anti-parasitic drugs that act locally within the gastrointestinal tract, this has historically required data gathered from terminal studies, meaning the animals were artificially infected with gastrointestinal parasites and then euthanized at the conclusion of the study,\" Gottlieb said.</p><p>This was done \"so that researchers could physically examine the GI tract for parasites or parasite damage, to evaluate whether the drug was effective,\" he noted.</p><p>However, the proposed new study might get around the need for euthanization altogether.</p><p>In the new trial, three groups of dogs will each receive three pills over the course of several months. Blood tests will be drawn to see if concentrations of the medicines are equivalent to those seen in the dogs treated with a similar, already marketed drug.</p><p>That should \"establish a clear benchmark for how these drugs are absorbed in the dogs' blood,\" Gottlieb explained. Once that data is known, calculations can be made that simply \"model the absorption of drugs [by dogs] in the future, rather than requiring the drugs to be tested on live dogs,\" he said.</p><p>The dogs involved in this breakthrough study will be treated well, Gottlieb added.</p><p>\"Because we know that it's important to prepare the dogs to be calm for their blood draws, and to give them a head start on their transition to life as pets, the research staff will work with the dogs to socialize and acclimate them to their environment for at least two months before this study begins,\" he said.</p><p>\"The dogs will receive regular veterinary care, including vaccinations and other preventive care, so that they remain happy, well-socialized and healthy,\" according to Gottlieb. \"At the conclusion of the study, the dogs will be retired for adoption as pets.\" </p><p>The FDA has recently re-focused its efforts on reducing the need for animal trials generally, creating its own Animal Welfare Council in January 2018.  The council provides \"centralized oversight of all animal research activities and facilities under its purview,\" he said.</p><p>Gottlieb stressed that, in some cases, animals are still vital to research that could save people's lives. But, \"we're committed to exploring ways to help FDA scientists and product developers reduce reliance on this practice,\" he said, and the newly proposed study \"is a big part of that effort.\"</p><p>The FDA says it is accepting public comment on the new canine trial over the next 60 days.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Find out more about animal testing at the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/od/science/integrity/acupo/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

There's a third option that might suit you even better.</p><p>The concept is called carb cycling, shorthand for alternating between high- and low-carbohydrate days. There's even a variation that lets you make every seventh day a cheat day.</p><p>The idea is to mesh two theories about carbohydrates -- that low-carb diets lead to more effective weight loss but that carbs are needed to maximize the effects of high-intensity exercise days. Adding in high-carb days could also be better for your metabolism than a constant low-carbohydrate diet.</p><p>Carb cycling lets you tailor carbohydrate intake to your needs. For instance, the American Council on Exercise points out that to lose weight, you might try a plan of five low-carb days and two high-carb days each week. If improving muscle mass is your goal, reverse that ratio -- five high-carb days interspersed with two low-carb days, matching the high-carb days to your most intense workout days.</p><p><b>Carb Cycling to Lose Weight: </b></p><ul><li>Make your low-carb days Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays.</li><li>Make your high-carb days Wednesdays and Saturdays.</li></ul><p><b>Carb Cycling to Boost Muscle: </b></p><ul><li>Make your low-carb days Wednesdays and Saturdays.</li><li>Make your high-carb days Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays.</li></ul><p>Science is just beginning to look at the value of a high-carb/low-protein diet. One 8-week study on mice found it may have the same longevity benefits as calorie restriction. While it's too soon to make projections for people, the researchers point out that however many carbs you eat, they should be high-quality whole grains and vegetables, with moderate fruit intake to limit fructose.</p><p>Processed, packaged high-carb foods with added sugars don't deliver good nutrition and can trigger hormonal changes that can make losing weight harder. Whenever you're putting carbs on the menu, choose fresh or minimally processed foods that are high in fiber and have only naturally occurring sugars.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Council on Exercise has detailed information on <a href=\"https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/lifestyle/blog/5872/what-you-need-to-know-about-carb-cycling\" target=\"_new\">carb cycling</a> to help you try this eating plan.</p>",

The infants were all diagnosed with the sleep disorder by their first birthday.</p><p>Of these children, 193 had central sleep apnea, which occurs when the body temporarily pauses or reduces breathing efforts during sleep. Meanwhile, 679 of the infants had obstructive sleep apnea, which occurs when the throat muscles relax and temporarily block the airway. The discharge documents on the remaining 4,096 infants did not specify the type of sleep apnea the children had.</p><p>\"By studying a limited supply of data, we only got a snapshot of these hospital cases. We were not able to see everything, like what medications the infants were on or what diagnosis they had,\" said study leader Dr. Daniel Combs, a sleep specialist at the university.</p><p>Still, the analysis revealed that infants with central sleep apnea and a heart abnormality had the worst outcomes. These babies were four times more likely to die in the hospital. Their hospitalizations were also twice as long and twice as costly as the other infants.</p><p>\"Screening is important to prevent this. We have to lower our threshold to screen for sleep apnea; that could improve these negative outcomes,\" Combs said in a university news release. \"If we learn that infants do have sleep apnea, we can refer them for treatment.\"</p><p>Central sleep apnea is treated with supplemental oxygen or a therapeutic device that assists with breathing.

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 3, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Preschoolers who quickly pack on pounds may be at particular risk of becoming obese teenagers, a large new study finds.</p><p>Experts said the results point to a critical \"window\" in early childhood -- between the ages of 2 and 5 or 6 years -- that can set the stage for persistent obesity.</p><p>They also said the findings leave some questions unanswered. Why do some young children gain excessive amounts of body fat? And will altering their diets ultimately prevent obesity later on?</p><p>The study looked at weight-gain patterns among more than 51,000 German children.</p><p>Researchers found that more than half of obese teenagers had already become overweight or obese by age 5. And the strongest risk factor for teen obesity was faster-than-normal weight gain between the ages of 2 and 6.</p><p>The findings are \"very important,\" said Dr. Michael Freemark, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. Both were published Oct. 4 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>. </p><p>\"This identifies a developmental window that's a powerful predictor of obesity in adolescence,\" said Freemark, a professor of pediatrics at Duke University in Durham, N.C.</p><p>He explained what the normal trajectory of weight gain looks like early in life. First, babies pack on a lot of fat, which is healthy and necessary, Freemark said. By the time they are 1 year old, their body mass index (BMI) should be much higher than it was in early infancy. (BMI is a measure of weight in relation to height.)</p><p>After that, BMI declines as a child grows taller and sheds \"baby fat\" -- hitting a low around the age of 5 or 6. Then, Freemark said, there is a body-fat \"rebound\" where BMI gradually rises through the rest of childhood and the teen years.</p><p>According to Freemark, this study suggests that if the rebound happens early -- or if children never lose their baby fat -- the risk of teen obesity rises.</p><p>\"What this doesn't tell us is why those children gained weight excessively during this developmental window,\" Freemark said.</p><p>There may be a role for factors earlier in life -- such as whether kids were breastfed or bottle-fed, or whether their moms had diabetes during pregnancy, according to Freemark.</p><p>\"But it's probably related to a number of variables,\" he said.</p><p>Dr. Antje Korner, the senior researcher on the study, agreed.</p><p>The roots of obesity are \"complex,\" and involve a mix of genes and environmental influences, said Korner, of the University of Leipzig's Center for Pediatric Research in Germany.</p><p>What's important, said Korner, is that parents and pediatricians are aware of this \"critical\" age window where obesity risk manifests itself.</p><p>When children that age are overweight, she said, it should not be dismissed as baby fat that will go away.</p><p>In the United States, 1 in 5 children and teens is overweight, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This sets them up for future health problems such as diabetes and heart disease.</p><p>The current study was based on 51,505 kids whose BMI was measured repeatedly during childhood and adolescence.</p><p>In most cases, the study found, normal-weight teens had been normal-weight their whole lives. But the picture was different for obese teens: Before age 2 they usually had a normal BMI, but 53 percent had become overweight or obese by age 5.</p><p>And children with an early \"acceleration\" in BMI during the preschool years were at heightened risk of teen obesity. Their odds were 40 percent higher, versus kids whose BMI held steady during preschool.</p><p>For now, Freemark said, it's not clear whether changing those youngsters' diets will ward off teen obesity.</p><p>But he encouraged parents to take their kids to routine checkups, to see whether their weight gain is on track. If it's excessive, Freemark said, parents might need nutrition counseling.</p><p>He also pointed to some general diet rules that are \"reasonable for any child\" -- such as avoiding sugary drinks, sweets and fast food, and limiting fried foods and starches.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Nemours Foundation has more on <a href=\"https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/overweight-obesity.html?WT.ac=p-ra\" target=\"_new\">childhood obesity</a>.</p>",

He is a doctoral candidate with the University of London, in England.</p><p>Diet is central to the control of type 2 diabetes, which affects more than 30 million people in the United States, the researchers said in background notes.</p><p>Vegan diets eliminate all animal products from your food, including eggs and dairy, said Rahaf Al Bochi, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.</p><p>For their evidence review, Toumpanakis and his colleagues collected data on 433 participants in 11 different clinical trials. Of those trials, eight involved fully vegan diets, while the remainder were vegetarian. The trials lasted an average 23 weeks.</p><p>People eating plant-based diets experienced an improvement in their physical health and better control of their diabetes, the findings showed.</p><p>\"These studies demonstrated that this eating pattern helped them to better control their serum glucose [blood sugar] levels, as well as improve their lipid and cholesterol levels,\" Toumpanakis said.</p><p>People eating the plant-based diets also experienced a marked easing of their diabetes-related nerve pain, with the results suggesting that such an eating plan might slow progressive nerve damage associated with diabetes, the researchers said.</p><p>In six of the studies, patients were able to cut down or discontinue drugs they were taking either for their diabetes or for symptoms of diabetes.</p><p>The studies also found that people experienced improved psychological well-being. Depression levels dropped, while overall quality of life improved.</p><p>\"We would say that people with type 2 diabetes following a plant-based diet might be happier because, as the studies suggest, the majority found that through this eating pattern they can have a better control of their condition,\" Toumpanakis said.</p><p> \"If through diet they can have the power to improve their physical symptoms and their glucose levels, and reduce or even stop some of their medication, then this has a huge impact on their quality of life,\" he added.</p><p>Toumpanakis said there's nothing to be lost in switching to a plant-based diet, noting that both the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American College of Endocrinology promote vegetarian or vegan diets as the optimal nutrition plan for people with diabetes.</p><p>But the study didn't prove that a plant-based diet improved the patients' mental and physical health, just that there was an association.</p><p>And Al Bochi isn't ready to embrace the review's findings.</p><p>She noted that of the 11 studies included in the review, only four tracked the people's psychological well-being.</p><p>\"Keeping that in mind, we're working with very small sample sizes,\" Al Bochi said.</p><p>Prior studies have shown that food can play a role in a person's mood, she said, but \"whether there's an exact mechanism with meat products and mood, I'm not sure if there is an actual association.\"</p><p>In addition, protein can increase the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that can help improve mood, she noted.</p><p> Al Bochi suggested that people can best control their mood through food by making sure they eat regular meals, to prevent the \"hangry\" feelings that can come from blood sugar swings.</p><p>\"There's a lot of different nutrients we know that can help with mood.

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Sept. 18, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Will Treinen has never been one to sit on the sidelines. The 51-year-old entrepreneur sacrificed many nights and weekends building a successful consulting company in Olympia, Washington. When he's off the clock, Will and his wife, Denise, enjoy spending time with their two grown daughters and two young grandchildren, as well as hiking, rock climbing and biking.</p> <p>\"My energy has always been forward,\" Will said. \"As a business person, I'm always thinking six to 12 months in the future.\"</p> <p>In 2017, the couple embarked on the STP, a two-day ride from Seattle to Portland. On the first day, Will felt great. But the next morning, shortly into their ride, he was overcome by exhaustion and couldn't catch his breath.</p> <p>This had happened before while training; he suspected sports-induced asthma and urged Denise to ride ahead. But when she went back for him a few minutes later, Will was lying on the ground surrounded by a group of bikers. His skin was blue, and he was gasping for breath. </p> <p>Fortunately, Madeline Dahl, a then-24-year-old cardiac nurse from Seattle who was riding the STP with her father, arrived upon the scene. When she couldn't find Will's pulse, she began giving chest compressions.</p> <p>Approximately 90 percent of people who experience a cardiac arrest outside of the hospital die, according to the American Heart Association. But performed immediately, CPR can double or triple the odds of survival. By the time the paramedics arrived, Madeline had performed several rounds of CPR. </p> <p>Will's pulse returned briefly before fading again.</p> <p>Paramedics took over from Madeline and were still performing CPR when the ambulance departed for the hospital, shocking Will with a defibrillator between compressions. Later that day, Madeline was disappointed to hear from another rider that he had not survived. </p> <p>\"I felt sad for Denise that he hadn't made it despite my best efforts,\" Madeline said.</p> <p>The rumors of Will's death were exaggerated.</p> <p>The first thing he remembers clearly is waking up in the hospital in Tacoma, eight days later, having undergone open-heart surgery to correct an 80 to 90 percent blockage in his main coronary artery. Tubes were coming out of his abdomen, and he felt disoriented by the medications.</p> <p>Although his father had died of heart disease, Will had few obvious risk factors. Unlike his father, he did not smoke, and his cholesterol and blood pressure were not considered by doctors to be cause for concern.</p> <p>Alone at night, he contemplated his mortality. </p> <p>\"I was on the edge a couple of times,\" Will said. \"In every sense, I was dead, and they revived me. Why? What's my purpose?\"</p> <p>One of Will's first actions was to email the top management at his company, asking them to handle the business in his absence. He didn't return to work for months; even now, more than a year later, he only checks in two or three days a week. He'd always planned to retire in his 50s, he said, although perhaps not as young as 51. </p> <p>\"I realized that I was valuing my progress in the business world over my relationships with my children and my experiences with them,\" Will said.</p>   <p>Madeline learned that Will survived several days after the race. A co-worker saw a story on the evening news about Will's cardiac event and the mystery nurse who saved him.</p> <p>The mystery was solved, and Will and Denise eventually invited Madeline to their house for dinner.</p> <p>\"I see plenty of bad outcomes, so seeing somebody who is doing so well is renewing,\" Madeline said.</p> <p>Motivated by his experience, Will is working to raise awareness about the importance of CPR. He spoke at an annual executive breakfast sponsored by the Tacoma chapter of the AHA earlier this year, and he formed a team for the 2018 South Sound Heart &amp; Stroke Walk on Sept. 22.</p> <p>\"I'm a very passionate person, and when I put my energy into something, it's 100 percent,\" Will said.</p> <p>Indeed, less than four months after Will had his cardiac arrest, he and Denise hiked to the 4,000-foot summit of Mount Rose in Washington state -- a longtime item on their bucket list. And the year after Will's life nearly ended during the STP race, he and Denise did the STP again. Knee pain prompted Will to stop after the first day, but Denise pressed on and finished, pausing for an emotional moment near mile 115, where the life-changing incident occurred.</p> <p>\"It was extremely therapeutic for us (riding the first day together),\" Will said. \"We had a blast.\"</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 5, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Caffeine-laden energy drinks are popular, but they might make your blood vessels less efficient, a small study suggests. </p><p>These drinks -- sold as Monster and Red Bull, to name two -- have been linked to heart, nerve and stomach problems, researchers say. </p><p>\"A lot of young kids use energy drinks when they exercise, a time when you need your arterial function to be at its top,\" said lead researcher Dr. John Higgins. He's a  professor of medicine at McGovern Medical School at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston. </p><p>Exercise and sports require maximum blood flow so oxygen can get to cells quickly, Higgins said. Energy drinks that reduce the vessels' diameter, in effect, restrict blood flow and oxygen delivery, he explained.</p><p>\"It's more work for the heart and less oxygen supply for the heart. This could explain why there have been cases where kids have had a cardiac arrest after an energy drink,\" he said. </p><p>Plus, people often chug energy drinks so they get the full effect in one shot, and that might be dangerous, Higgins said.</p><p>\"These drinks are not intended for children,\" Higgins warned. In addition, people under 18, women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, caffeine-sensitive individuals, those taking stimulants or caffeine-based drugs or those with heart disease should stay away from energy drinks, he added. </p><p>The study included 44 healthy, non-smoking medical students in their 20s. The researchers tested the effect of a 24-ounce energy drink on cells lining blood vessels, called endothelial cells.</p><p>The function of these cells was tested before and after the participants consumed the energy drink, and again 90 minutes later. The researchers looked at artery flow-mediated dilation -- an ultrasound measurement that is an indicator of overall blood vessel health. </p><p>After 90 minutes, the internal diameter of blood vessels tested was dramatically smaller, on average, than before, the investigators found. </p><p>This negative effect on blood vessels may be related to ingredients in the energy drink, such as caffeine, taurine, sugar and other herbals, the researchers suggested. Taurine is an amino acid touted as increasing energy and was originally extracted from bull semen -- hence the name Red Bull, the researchers said. </p><p>According to Dr. David Katz, director of Yale University's Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center, \"Endothelial function is, in general, a potent indicator of cardiovascular risk.\" </p><p>But, Katz said, \"this is a small study looking only at acute effects and cannot be considered proof that energy drinks injure the cardiovascular system over time.\" </p><p>That being said, the combination of sugar and stimulants in these drinks has no proven benefit, Katz added.</p><p>\"There are far better ways to boost energy, such as standing up and getting a bit of exercise,\" he suggested.  \"In the absence of a reliable benefit, even a low level of risk is objectionable.\"</p><p>A spokesman for an industry group that represents makers of energy drinks said the drinks are safe.</p><p>\"Mainstream energy drinks contain about half the caffeine of a similarly sized cup of coffeehouse coffee, and have been extensively studied and confirmed safe for consumption by government safety authorities worldwide,\" said William Dermody, spokesman for the American Beverage Association. \"Nothing in this preliminary research counters this well-established fact.\"</p><p>The study findings are scheduled for presentation Nov. 12 at a meeting of the American Heart Association, in Chicago. </p><p>Research presented at meetings is typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>To learn more about caffeine and heart disease, visit the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/caffeine-and-heart-disease\" target=\"_new\"> American Heart Association</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 7, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- After stepping out of his golf cart on the 18th fairway, Andrew Lask Jr. felt dizzy and wobbled a bit. He was playing a charity event at Tamarack Country Club in Greenwich, Conn., where, at age 25, Lask was their youngest teaching professional.</p> <p>He tried to focus, but when he looked down at the ball, he became even dizzier.</p> <p>\"My playing partner was up by the green screaming at me to hit,\" Lask said. \"I remember swinging and hitting the ball nowhere in the direction I wanted it to go. Afterward, I went straight to the pro shop to call my father and lie down.\"</p> <p>The dizziness continued, along with a screaming headache, which he and his father thought might be related to heat and a long day of playing. Lask gulped down Gatorade and ate salty chips, while his father insisted on taking him to the emergency room of the nearest hospital.</p> <p>A checkup and CT scan showed nothing irregular, so Lask was sent home.</p> <p>\"I didn't emphasize the burning sensation in my neck and how bad the headache was, but I'm not sure it would have mattered,\" Lask said. \"I was 25 and in excellent shape.\"</p> <p>He felt dizzy and nauseous for several days, staying in bed most of the time. His father took him to an urgent care facility, where doctors thought maybe he had a virus. Then they visited their family doctor, who was concerned enough to order an MRI.</p> <p>Andrew Lask Sr. was in the room when the neurologist looked at the results.</p> <p>\"Oh my God, he had a stroke,\" the doctor said.</p> <p>\"Whoa, how is that possible?\" Andrew Sr. said.</p> <p>Doctors concluded that Lask had suffered from an activity-related stroke, most likely from swinging the golf club. He tore or damaged the inner lining of an artery, which is called an arterial vertebral dissection, causing a clot to form. The clot expanded until it stifled blood flow to the brain.</p> <p>In Lask's case, doctors determined that because he had survived the stroke and was functioning he should heal naturally.</p> <p>\"They kept me in the hospital for a week, but I had no surgeries or medication,\" he said.</p> <p>He continued to be checked every six months for three years, getting a clean bill of health each time. His only lingering symptoms were fatigue and balance issues, which lasted a few years. He also feared a recurrence, though doctors assured him it was a freak occurrence.</p> <p>\"After it happened, it took me a while to play golf again,\" Lask said. \"I returned to golf a year later and I remember being scared after swings that it would hurt my neck, but now I'm back to golf at full strength.\"</p> <p>Lask stayed at the club for another seven years. While the stroke didn't hinder his golf game, it didn't help either, leaving him feeling less marketable for pro positions.</p> <p>\"I always thought I would be a head golf professional or a financial planner, the two things I loved,\" Lask said.</p> <p>So he gave up the golf course for Wall Street. He's now an adviser at Morgan Stanley in Manhattan.</p> <p>Not that he's totally done teaching. </p> <p>\"I'm always giving two-minute swing tips in the hallways, and everyone wants to go to the driving range with me,\" he said.</p> <p>These days, Lask continues to golf for fun, as well as play basketball and tennis, run, and work out at a gym. </p> <p>\"The difference is I carry my phone on me at all times,\" he said. </p> <p>On the plus side, he said he's now more empathetic to others' challenges and health issues. He's also become very active in the American Heart Association's Young Professionals Committee in New York City, which works to raise awareness and funds for heart and stroke issues and research.</p> <p>Lask's father also has drawn strength from his son's stroke, which he memorialized by affixing the hospital visitation sticker from June 8, 2006, to his car dashboard.</p> <p>\"Anytime I'm feeling sorry for myself if things aren't going well,\" he said, \"I look at that sticker and remind myself how lucky I am.\"</p>",

            "Body__c": "<!--Spanish ID: 738221 --><p>SUNDAY, Sept. 30, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- It's a perfect case of the enemy of my enemy is my friend.</p><p>A potentially dangerous bacteria appears to target malignant cells and could provide a new means of fighting cancer, a small, preliminary study reports.</p><p>The bacteria, <i>Clostridium novyi-NT</i>, can cause gas gangrene and sepsis if infection is allowed to run amok in a wound.</p><p>But when injected into a tumor, <i>Clostridium novyi-NT</i> appears to both attack the cancer directly and encourage the body's immune response against the cancer cells, said lead researcher Dr. Filip Janku. He is an associate professor at the department of investigational cancer therapeutics at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston.</p><p>\"Patients only had one week of exposure to the bacteria, but even with that limited exposure we saw quite interesting and, in some patients, clinically meaningful activity,\" Janku said.</p><p><i>Clostridium novyi</i> has been linked to human illness. In 2000, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a handful of drug users in the United Kingdom fell ill or died after their injection sites became infected with the bacteria.</p><p>The strain used in this clinical trial, <i>Clostridium novyi-NT</i>, had been weakened to prevent it from producing its toxin, which can be lethal in humans, Janku said. The NT stands for \"non-toxic.\"</p><p><i>Clostridium novyi</i> flourishes in low-oxygen environments. Researchers thought this might make the bacteria a prime candidate for cancer fighting, by keeping the infection focused on the tumor site.</p><p>\"Normal tissues, even if they are low on oxygen, they always have enough oxygen to not allow this bacteria to germinate and proliferate,\" Janku explained. \"Cancerous tissue is low in oxygen, most often in the center of the cancers.\"</p><p>To test whether the bacteria could help fight cancer, researchers injected the tumors of 24 patients with a single dose of <i>Clostridium novyi-NT</i>, ranging from 10,000 to 3 million spores.</p><p>Fifteen of the patients had sarcoma, two patients had melanoma, and seven had a variety of cancers, the researchers said.</p><p>The scientists expected <i>Clostridium novyi-NT</i> to help fight the tumor in two ways.</p><p>First, the bacterial infection itself could cause direct destruction of the tumor cells, Janku said.</p><p>\"If that happens, it actually helps to increase the presence of tumor-specific antigens, which are proteins that make a tumor more obvious to the immune system,\" Janku said. \"It can prime the immune system to attack the cancer.\"</p><p>The bacteria also could activate the immune system to fight the cancer even if the infection didn't kill off tumor cells, Janku added.</p><p>Patients in this clinical trial were left with the bacterial infection for one week, and then everyone was given antibiotics to kill off the <i>Clostridium novyi-NT</i>, Janku said.</p><p>\"<i>Clostridium</i> is actually quite susceptible to antibiotics,\" Janku noted.</p><p>The bacteria germinated in the cancers of 11 out of the 24 patients, with tumor cells dying off as a result.</p><p>Tumor shrinkage of greater than 10 percent was observed in 23 percent of patients. However, Janku said this could be an underestimate since the infection causes surrounding tissue to become inflamed, making the lesion appear larger than it actually is.</p><p>Following bacterial therapy, cancer stabilized in 21 patients. When both injected and uninjected lesions were included, the stable disease rate was 86 percent, the researchers reported.</p><p>The potential for <i>Clostridium novyi-NT</i> to prompt an immune response against cancer is intriguing, said Sacha Gnjatic, who is associate director of the Human Immune Monitoring Center at Mount Sinai in New York City.</p><p>\"That's where the promise of this type of therapy lies. You would expect that the injected lesion would have some type of response because you're disrupting the tumor cells,\" Gnjatic said. \"What would be interesting is if this could prime an immune response that would eventually also take care of the non-injected tumors. That's the holy grail of immunotherapy.\"</p><p>Janku said he's particularly excited by the ability of the bacteria to battle sarcomas, which are cancers that occur in bone, muscle and soft tissues.</p><p>\"Classic immunotherapy which is now approved or being heavily investigated doesn't seem to be working for a majority of sarcomas,\" Janku explained.</p><p>Researchers have moved on to the next phase, in which patients taking the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab (Keytruda) will also be treated with a single injection of <i>Clostridium novyi-NT</i>, Janku said. The researchers suspect the two therapies used in combination will create a strong immune response against cancers.</p><p>However, they will have to keep an eye on potential side effects from <i>Clostridium novyi-NT</i>, Janku added.</p><p>Two patients treated with the heaviest dose of 3 million spores of Clostridium novyi-NT fell ill with sepsis and/or gas gangrene, leading researchers to set the maximum tolerated dose at 1 million spores.</p><p>Researchers also found the bacteria in the bloodstream of a couple of patients, meaning that the infection will need to be carefully tracked, Janku said.</p><p>\"That didn't result in clostridium seeding anywhere else outside the injected region, but it's a theoretical possibility since we were able to detect it in the blood culture of one or two patients,\" Janku said.</p><p>Patients also could be susceptible to immune response side effects, such as low blood pressure or fever, he added.</p><p>The trial results were to be presented Sunday  at the International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference, in New York City. The meeting is jointly sponsored by the Cancer Research Institute, the Association for Cancer Immunotherapy, the European Academy of Tumor Immunology, and the American Association for Cancer Research.</p><p>Research presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Cancer Institute  has more about <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types\" target=\"_new\">cancer treatment</a>.</p>",

She's an assistant professor at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C.</p><p>For the study, the researchers fed female monkeys a high-fat Western diet or a plant-based Mediterranean diet for 2.5 years.

It might be that damage to the heart causes clots that can travel to the brain, he said. </p><p>\"These findings will change the way we think of the relationship between heart attack and stroke,\" said Merkler.</p><p>Current practice is to have patients take antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin, after a heart attack. But these new findings suggest that patients might need blood thinners to prevent clots, Merkler said. More studies are needed to see which works best, he added.</p><p>The researchers looked at more than 1.7 million Medicare patients, of whom more than 46,000 were hospitalized for a heart attack and 80,000 for a stroke. The investigators found a higher risk for stroke among patients who'd had a heart attack compared with patients who didn't suffer a heart attack.  </p><p>The greatest risk was in the first month after heart attack patients left the hospital, Merkler said.</p><p>But the risk remained high during the five to 12 weeks after discharge, he added. After 12 weeks, the risk appeared to return to pre-heart attack levels.</p><p>Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a cardiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, said earlier studies have shown that after a heart attack, both men and women are at greater risk for a stroke.</p><p>But, the time when the risk is greatest has not been certain, said Fonarow, who also directs the Ahmanson-UCLA Cardiomyopathy Center. </p><p>This new study finds the greatest risk of stroke is during the first four weeks after hospital discharge, but it persists for 12 weeks regardless of the type of heart attack, he said.</p><p>\"These findings highlight the need to more effectively prevent and treat heart attacks to help mitigate the potential debilitating risk of stroke,\" said Fonarow, who was not involved with the research.</p><p>The study was presented Sunday at a meeting of the American Neurological Association, in Atlanta. Research presented at meetings is usually considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart Association has more on the risks of <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/understand-your-risks-to-prevent-a-heart-attack\" target=\"_new\">heart attack</a>.</p>",

Both steps are considered standard for proper psychiatric care.</p><p>And while some children may be getting medicines they don't need, others may be going without drugs that can help them. Many kids may not be receiving drug therapy that could help them better socialize or concentrate at school, the report found.</p><p>The drugs under review included those used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, PTSD, depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  Foster kids were more prone to receive these meds than kids in the general population, the report found.</p><p>Foster children \"are at greater risk of not getting the medications they need, but equally important, they are at risk of getting powerful medications that they do not need,\" Ann Maxwell, an assistant inspector general, told the <i>AP</i>.</p><p>Poor planning or follow-up can have tragic consequences for children, the report noted. In one case, an 11-year-old boy in foster care was initially placed on two meds after being diagnosed with anxiety, ADHD and other issues. But his foster mother had difficulties getting refills, and when drug therapy lapsed the child began displaying destructive, disruptive behaviors.</p><p>According to the report, the state in which the boy lived had no rules regarding follow-up with foster parents regarding a child's medications.</p><p>The report authors are recommending that the HHS Administration for Children and Families work with states to improve oversight on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Responding to the report, the agency said that it might require additional legal authority to do so.  The care of foster children is the shared responsibility of federal, state and local agencies, the <i>AP</i> noted.</p><p>Complicating the issue is the fact that the well-being of any one foster child is typically divided between foster parents, birth parents, relatives and case workers -- upping the odds that miscommunications between those parties will affect the child's medical care.</p>",

In addition, the nature of the study cannot prove if service jobs are the only reason for longer employment.</p><p>Weiss and her colleagues found that employees with criminal records had 34 percent higher odds of misconduct in sales jobs, but not in service jobs. This may mean that employees with criminal records do better and stay longer in customer service jobs than sales jobs.</p><p>Despite the higher misconduct rate, sales employees with a criminal record may be good investments for employers. Hiring a worker with a criminal record for sales jobs increases the expected cost of theft by about $43, but saves the same employer about $746 in turnover costs, the researchers said.</p><p>The report was published Sept. 11 in the journal <i>IZA Journal of Labor Policy</i>. </p><p>\"Finding gainful employment for individuals with a criminal background is an important public priority: without such employment, reoffending is almost inevitable,\" Weiss said in a journal news release. </p><p>The findings suggest \"there are unexploited opportunities to hiring applicants with a record in a way that makes sense both on efficiency and on moral grounds,\" she said. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on employment for ex-offenders, visit the <a href=\"https://www.careeronestop.org/ExOffender/FindAJob/FindOpenings/who-hire-ex-offenders.aspx\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. Department of Labor</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 1, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Social stigma may play a large role in the depression, anxiety and other mental health woes experienced by many people with autism, a small new study indicates.</p><p>British researchers found that 72 percent of the psychological distress reported in 111 adults with autism was linked to social stigma, including discrimination and rejection.</p><p>Many people with autism said they're treated like no one thinks they're smart or that no one will hire someone like them. This kind of stigma can take a toll on the psyche, the researchers said.</p>  <p>\"We already suspected there would be a significant impact of discrimination on the mental health of the autistic population, it's just that no one's really studied the impact of that before,\" said study author Monique Botha. She's a doctoral student and post-graduate researcher at the University of Surrey, in England.</p><p>\"The only thing we were surprised by was how potentially strong a relationship there was,\" added Botha, who has autism. \"To put it colloquially, it blew our minds.\"</p><p>A disorder that can affect communication, social interaction and creative play, autism is diagnosed in about one in every 59 children in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and persist through adulthood.</p><p>Prior research has established that people with an autism spectrum disorder are more prone to anxiety, depression and suicide than the general population. They are also more likely to suffer physical, verbal and sexual abuse, and face workplace harassment and dismissal, according to 01217000000c1gRAAQs.</p><p>Botha and her colleagues conducted an online survey with adults who say they have autism. The researchers used the so-called \"minority stress theory\" to evaluate stressors believed to contribute to lower mental health in stigmatized minority groups, extending that category to those with autism.</p><p>The survey questions touched on six areas of stress, including: victimization and discrimination; \"outness,\" meaning how often those with autism disclose their condition to others; everyday discrimination; expectation of rejection; physical concealment of their condition; and internalized stigma.</p><p>The results indicated that social stress due to stigma also predicted lower levels of emotional, psychological and social well-being in people with autism, Botha said.</p><p>About 6 percent of people in the general population display high rates of psychological distress, compared to more than 50 percent of the study participants, Botha noted. Psychological distress is \"a really good signifier for clinical depression and anxiety,\" she added.</p><p>\"When you actually sit down and talk to autistic people themselves, they say one of the hardest things &hellip; is how people respond to you and how they treat you,\" Botha said. \"We hope this study will help change the way we think about autism and mental health, and make us think long and hard about the way we treat autistic people in society.\"</p><p>Eric Butter is director of the Child Development Center at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, which is part of the Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network.</p><p>He said it makes sense that \"people with autism can still experience discrimination and have areas in their life where they're excluded &hellip; [which] can affect their mental health and well-being.\"</p><p>Butter, who wasn't involved in the new research, said he hopes future studies will be done to \"better understand this finding.\" He was skeptical about the study's use of self-identified people with autism, saying a more rigorous diagnostic process would be optimal for research.</p><p>But \"it's really important to recognize that people with autism are people first. They are just as likely to experience being alienated, separated, lonely, and all the possible consequences of being inappropriately and unfortunately excluded from a social environment,\" Butter said. </p><p>\"When that happens, we should find a way of reacting that supports their social inclusion,\" he added.</p><p>The study was published recently in the journal <i>Society and Mental Health</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/index.html\" target=\"_new\">autism</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Sept. 17, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Despite decades of warnings about the hazards of baby walkers, thousands of toddlers still end up in hospital emergency rooms with walker-related injuries, new research shows.</p><p>The study reported that more than 230,000 children younger than 15 months old were treated in emergency rooms between 1990 and 2014. More than 10,000 of those youngsters ended up being admitted to the hospital.</p><p>\"Baby walkers remain a serious and preventable source of injury to young children and should not be used,\" said senior study author Dr. Gary Smith, director of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. </p><p>\"Baby walkers give quick mobility -- up to 4 feet per second -- to young children before they are developmentally ready,\" he said, stressing, \"there are still too many serious injuries occurring related to this product.\" </p><p>Infant walkers are made for use in young children who can't yet walk. Most injuries occur when a baby in a walker falls down stairs. Walkers also allow children access to things they might not otherwise be able to reach, such as an oven door or toxic household substances, the researchers said.</p><p>Injuries related to walkers include head injuries, such as skull fractures and concussions, burns, poisoning and drowning, the study team noted. </p><p>Stationary activity centers were introduced in 1994. These devices hold baby in a similar upright position, but don't have wheels. Instead, they have different activities within the baby's reach. </p><p>In 1997, a voluntary safety standard required the base of baby walkers to be wider than a standard 36-inch doorway, or to have a device that automatically engages a brake if one of the wheels drops over the edge of a step, the researchers said. Canada banned baby walkers in 2004. </p><p>In 2010, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) issued additional safety standards. These standards made it easier for the CPSC to stop noncomplying imported walkers from entering the marketplace. The American Academy of Pediatrics has called for a ban in the United States but, so far, the devices are still legal. </p><p>The latest study had both good news and bad news. The researchers found that between 1990 and 2003 baby walker injuries went down by 84.5 percent. The number of injuries from falling down stairs dropped by 91 percent. </p><p>During the four years after the 2010 standards were implemented, annual injuries dropped by nearly 23 percent compared to the four years before. </p><p>But of the children injured, 91 percent had a head or neck injury. Nearly three-quarters were hurt after falling down the stairs. </p><p>Smith said parents still underestimate the safety risk these devices pose. </p><p>\"Warning labels and educational campaigns have not been shown to be effective strategies for reducing baby walker-related injuries. Many families still use baby walkers, despite being aware of their potential dangers,\" he said.</p><p>\"Many parents believe baby walkers offer their children entertainment, promote walking, and provide a baby activity while parents are doing something else,\" Smith said. He added that these products do not promote walking. In fact, they may delay mental and motor development, he said.</p><p>But Smith isn't blaming parents for their baby's injuries. \"These are good parents who were carefully supervising their children and using the baby walker as intended. Their only error was that they believed the myth that baby walkers are safe to use.\"</p><p>Dr. Peter Richel, chief of pediatrics at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y., said he wasn't surprised by the findings.</p><p>\"No matter what gates you have or how securely you shut a door, kids still find a way to get around them,\" said Richel, who wasn't involved with the study.</p><p>\"I don't advocate using movable walkers, but if parents can find a safe place for one -- a sunken living room or a finished basement -- then I don't have a problem with them,\" he explained. But Richel said stationary activity centers are preferable and can be good for a child's development.</p><p>The study was published online Sept. 17 in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics has more on what you need to know about <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Baby-Walkers-A-Dangerous-Choice.aspx\" target=\"_new\">baby walkers</a>.</p>",

Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health showed.</p><p>Less often, parents blamed their child's busy schedule. More than 40 percent of the parents surveyed suggested their teens' homework load and activities disrupted their sleep schedule. Meanwhile, 31 percent of parents said worries about school affected their child's ability to sleep, and 23 percent said their teen's concerns about their social life kept them up at night. </p><p>In addition, 10 percent of parents reported that a health condition or medication had a negative effect on their child's sleep habits.</p><p>Many parents reported trying to encourage better sleep. More than half said they suggest limiting caffeine intake in the evening or tell their teen to turn off their phones and other electronic devices at bedtime. More than 40 percent recommend a snack before bed, 36 percent tried natural sleep remedies like melatonin, and 28 percent said their teen has tried a sleep aid.</p><p>But only 4 in 10 parents with sleep-deprived teens said they talked to a doctor about it. </p><p>Those who did bring up the matter with a doctor said they were generally advised to turn off electronics and phones at bedtime, stick to a regular sleep schedule and limit caffeine. Some physicians also suggested trying a natural sleep remedy.</p><p>\"Parents whose teens continue to have frequent sleep problems &hellip; may want to talk with a health care provider, particularly when considering which type of medication to try,\" Clark said. \"Inadequate or disrupted sleep can have long-lasting health effects that go beyond moodiness and irritability for teens.\"</p><p>These include difficulty concentrating in school and an increased risk of auto accidents, Clark said. \"Inadequate sleep has also been linked to health problems ranging from obesity to depression,\" she added.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The American Sleep Association has other information on <a href=\"https://www.sleepassociation.org/blog-post/sleep-and-electronics/\" target=\"_new\"> sleep and electronics</a>.</p>",

These drugs target a protein found on the body's immune cells and certain cancer cells called PD-1, the FDA explained. Libtayo is designed to help the body's immune system fight the cancer.</p><p>\"With the Libtayo approval, the FDA has approved six immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1 pathway for treating a variety of tumors, from bladder to head and neck cancer,\" said Dr. Richard Pazdur, director of the agency's Oncology Center of Excellence.</p><p>About 700,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with CSCC each year, making it the second most common form of skin cancer behind basal cell cancer, the FDA said.</p><p>CSCC usually develops on skin that has regularly been exposed to the sun and other sources of ultraviolet radiation, the agency said. When the cancer spreads, it can travel to the lymph nodes or other tissues and organs, potentially becoming life-threatening. </p><p>Clinical trials of Libtayo involving 108 people showed that more than 47 percent of those given the drug had their tumors shrink or disappear, the FDA said.</p><p>Common side effects include fatigue, rash and diarrhea. A more serious adverse reaction is that the immune system could attack normal organs and tissues.</p><p>Since Libtayo may harm a developing fetus, women of child-bearing age should use contraception while taking the drug, the agency said.</p><p>Libtayo is produced by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, based in Tarrytown, N.Y.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the FDA to <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm622044.htm\" target=\"_new\">learn more</a>.</p>",

They were followed for an average of close to five years.</p><p>Treatment with 100 milligrams of aspirin per day did not affect the chances a person would live longer free from dementia or disability, researchers found.</p><p>In fact, the group taking aspirin had a slightly increased risk of death -- 5.9 percent died compared with 5.2 percent taking a placebo. However, the higher death rate was due to more cancer deaths in the aspirin group, which could have been due to chance, the researchers said.</p><p>More troubling was the fact that people taking daily aspirin suffered clinically significant bleeding.</p><p>Hemorrhagic stroke, bleeding in the brain, gastrointestinal bleeding, or bleeding at other sites that required transfusion or hospitalization occurred in 3.8 percent of people on aspirin versus 2.7 percent of people on placebo.</p><p>\"There's definitely an increased bleeding risk, and it's not benign,\" said Dr. Vincent Bufalino, a cardiologist and spokesman for the American Heart Association. \"The intracranial bleeding risk is obviously a terrible complication.\"</p><p>The clinical trial's results suggest that \"if seniors don't have a valid medical need for taking aspirin, you are unlikely to benefit from it and there are some risks,\" concluded lead researcher John McNeil, head of epidemiology and preventive health at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.</p><p>However, all of the experts agreed that if you're now taking aspirin under a doctor's direction you shouldn't stop until you discuss it with them, regardless of your age.</p><p>\"Many people are taking aspirin for important medical reasons,\" McNeil said. \"It would be unwise to stop without speaking to their doctor about it.\"</p><p>The clinical trial was published online as three papers in the Sept. 16 issue of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has more about <a href=\" https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer \" target=\"_new\">daily low-dose aspirin</a>.</p>",

And sometimes you just don't have time to get to the store.</p><p>But the right frozen foods can be the fixings for low-calorie meals and snacks that are nutritious as well as satisfying.</p><p>Shrimp is a versatile protein that cooks in no time -- great in a veggie stir fry or just boiled and chilled to dip in cocktail sauce. Buy bags of frozen shelled and deveined shrimp, especially when they're on sale. Because they defrost in no time under cold running water, they're virtually ready when you are. Frozen fish fillets are another nutritious type of seafood to have on hand.</p><p>Produce from the frozen-food aisle can be as nutritious as fresh. Often, flash-frozen vegetables retain nutrients better than fresh produce that was trucked to your store and then kept in the fridge for a few days. Green peas are particularly tasty as a side dish, a salad topping and as a healthy sauce when pureed into a pesto.</p><p>Raspberries offer a bounty of nutrients, plus fiber. When fresh ones aren't available or affordable, head for the frozen foods case. In fact, all types of frozen berries and other frozen fruit chunks are great right out of the bag for making thick smoothies.</p><p>Having a package of whole-wheat flatbreads or tortillas in your freezer lets you make low-calorie pizzas and quesadillas.</p><p>A box of 100-percent frozen-fruit bars is perfect to have on hand for a refreshing snack.

The small study involved 36 healthy college-aged men and women and found that just 10 minutes of relaxed cycling on a stationary bike was all it took to improve recall during memory testing conducted right afterwards.</p><p>Why? Brain scans on 16 of the participants indicated that short bouts of mild exercise appeared to trigger an instant uptick in communication between the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the cortical brain regions. Both brain areas are key to processing memory.</p><p>Study author Hideaki Soya characterized the findings as \"striking evidence\" of how a \"very light [exercise] protocol indeed has beneficial effects on brains and cognition.\" He is chair of the Advanced Research Initiative for Human High Performance at the University of Tsukuba in Ibaraki, Japan.</p><p>Soya also said the results are \"good news for people who do not like to exercise,\" including those in poor physical health or older folks.</p><p>And even though the study only measured the exercise dividend among young men and women, Soya stressed that his team's earlier research suggests that mild exercise seems to produce broad results, \"not only with the young, but also with the elderly.\"</p><p>But just how long might the memory affect linger? Soya said it's too soon to say for sure. \"But at this time,\" he added, \"we can say that the exercise effect lasts at least 15 minutes after 10 minutes of exercise.\"</p><p>Soya and his colleagues report their findings in the Sept. 24 issue of the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Science</i>.</p><p>In the study, all participants randomly underwent memory testing twice, once after completing 10 minutes on a stationary bike and once after no exercise of any kind.</p><p>Memory testing began within five minutes following the exercise/no exercise task. Testing initially involved showing each participant images of everyday objects, at which point all were asked to indicate if the object was typically used indoors or outdoors.</p><p>In turn, all were then shown a second round of images and asked to recall if they had been shown the image before, or if the image was similar or entirely new.</p><p>A little less than half of the group had memory testing while also undergoing high-resolution f-MRI brain scans.</p><p>In the end, the research team found that when participants engaged in a short bout of light exercise, there was a \"rapid enhancement\" in their ability to recall information accurately.</p><p>What's more, the scans suggested that the observed enhancement seemed to reflect an increase in \"functional connectivity\" between brain centers critical to memory performance. The more such brain communication went up post-exercise, the more a person's memory skills improved, the investigators said.</p><p>Heather Snyder, senior director of medical and scientific operations with the Alzheimer's Association, said it remains to be seen to how the exercise-enhanced \"brain plasticity\" Soya's team observed among young adults will ultimately play out among seniors.</p><p>\"While there is widespread consensus that physical activity, even in moderation, is beneficial for brain health, less is known about the specific benefits or the biology of how physical activity works in our brains,\" said Snyder, who wasn't involved with the research.</p><p>\"The current findings are intriguing, because they suggest physical activity may improve memory,\" she acknowledged. And the AA makes a point of advising seniors to stay active, noting that \"physical activity is a valuable part of any overall body wellness plan and is associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline.\"</p><p>Still, Snyder stressed that \"an important next step is replicating the study in older adults to see if the same results are achieved.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on the importance of exercise among seniors at the <a href=\"https://www.alz.org/help-support/brain_health/stay_physically_active/\" target=\"_new\">Alzheimer's Association</a>.</p>",

It found that black patients were 24 percent less likely than white patients to receive an antiplatelet drug that wasn't aspirin. They were 9 percent less likely to get medication to reduce their level of lipids, fats in the blood.</p> <p>Black patients also had a 29 percent lower chance of getting an angiogram, an imaging technique used to see inside the heart's blood vessels, and were 45 percent less likely to undergo more aggressive therapy such as bypass surgery or angioplasty.</p> <p>The study only looked at heart attacks in which an artery was partially blocked, partially reducing blood flow. It excluded heart attacks in which a coronary artery is completely obstructed.</p> <p>Some of the study's findings provided hints about why racial differences in care have continued over the years. For example, the study found black patients are more likely than their white counterparts to smoke and have chronic illnesses such as diabetes and kidney disease in addition to their heart problems.</p> <p>\"If physicians see you as a high-risk patient, you might not benefit from all of these traditional therapies because they might be considered too aggressive for you,\" Arora said.</p> <p>The study also found that black patients were younger, more often women, and less likely to have medical insurance than white patients.</p> <p>The findings point to a need to have more voices join the conversation about disparities in patient care and the strategies necessary to achieve health equity, said Dr. Ivor Benjamin, president of the American Heart Association.</p> <p>\"These kinds of studies are extremely important if only that they get the attention of and can be viewed by policymakers, health care systems and providers,\" he said. The study also shows the need for early awareness and intervention in the black population to help chip away at some of the multiple risk factors they are more prone to have at younger ages.</p> <p>\"Diabetes, hypertension -- those kinds of factors may conspire to drive clinical presentation much earlier in blacks compared to whites,\" said Benjamin, director of the Cardiovascular Center at the Medical College of Wisconsin. \"What this says is that we need to continue to intensify our efforts at primary prevention while incorporating shared decision-making between providers and patients, especially at points of care using high-complexity interventions.\"</p> <p>For example, new AHA guidelines issued last November redefined high blood pressure as 130/80, versus the previous 140/90. That change of 10 millimeters of mercury was enough to classify nearly half of all Americans as having high blood pressure, which is particularly prevalent among black Americans.</p> <p>Arora agreed that emphasizing efforts to help black patients reduce their number of co-existing chronic illnesses could make the biggest difference.</p> <p>\"We should aim at reducing the cardiovascular risk factors in these patients,\" he said. \"I think that's where one of the main problems lie and that's where the interventions have to be made to eventually reduce disparities in these patients.\"</p>",

But, she said, obesity can also have \"an immediate impact\" on kids' well-being.</p><p>In this case, Gill and her team focused on five specific markers of \"flourishing.\" They surveyed 22,914 parents and caregivers of kids ages 10 to 17, asking them whether their child:</p><ul><li>\"Shows interest and curiosity in learning new things,\"</li><li>\"Works to finish tasks he or she starts,\" </li> <li>\"Stays calm and in control when faced with a challenge,\"</li> <li>\"Cares about doing well in school,\"</li><li>\"Does all required homework.\"</li></ul><p>Overall, nearly 28 percent of obese kids were reported to show all five markers of flourishing -- versus 39 percent of normal-weight kids and 37 percent of overweight children.</p><p>According to Gill, kids who were obese did tend to spend more time on digital media and get less sleep. But even when the researchers accounted for those differences -- as well as family poverty and parents' education levels -- obesity itself was still linked to lower odds of flourishing.</p><p>\"There is a clear negative relationship between obesity and markers of flourishing,\" Gill said. But, she noted, \"it's difficult to know which came first.\"</p><p>Bolling agreed that there's a \"chicken-and-egg\" question. For instance, it's possible that kids who are ostracized or disengaged at school are more likely to gain weight excessively.</p><p>Gill was scheduled to present the findings Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Pediatrics, in Orlando, Fla. In general, studies released at meetings are considered preliminary until they're published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>For now, Gill and Bolling recommended that adults be aware that obese kids can face more challenges at school, and with coping skills.</p> <p>\"Kids manifest stress in different ways,\" Bolling noted. \"It can turn up as physical symptoms, difficulties with relationships, or poorer school performance.\"</p><p>Gill suggested parents regularly sit down with their kids to simply have conversations and check in on how they are doing.</p><p>She said research shows that flourishing markers seem to be similar to personality traits: They stay the same over time. So if children do not develop them, Gill said, that could affect them into adulthood.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics has more on <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/obesity/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_new\">childhood obesity</a>.</p>",

And while it sounds counter-intuitive,  exercise gives you more energy -- it feeds on itself in a good way. Researchers at the University of Georgia found that healthy but sedentary adults who did as little as 20 minutes of low-to-moderate cardio (think brisk walking) three days a week felt more energized after just a few weeks.</p><p>\"I don't have time to exercise.\" Who doesn't feel squeezed by a busy schedule? And yes, driving back and forth to the gym can double the time you need to allot to a workout. So skip the trip and invest in home equipment. But still can't find a 30-minute block of time? Break up your workout into a few short segments a day. Steal 10 to 15 minutes before the kids wake up and another 15 after they go to sleep.</p><p>\"I'm too out of shape to exercise.\" Being out of shape is no reason to sit on the sidelines and <i>stay</i> out of shape. Fitness can start with just one step. If you're unhappy with your appearance, work out at home at first or invest in exercise clothes that flatter you. Set small, realistic goals that you can build on. Begin with 5 minutes of walking and focus on the present, not the 30 minutes you hope to accomplish. Praise yourself for getting started, rather than berate yourself for not having Olympic fitness status.</p><p>Keep the momentum going by rewarding yourself with fitness-related items such as a high-tech monitor or watch or new exercise clothes as your size decreases.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Council on Exercise has great tips to <a href=\" https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/lifestyle/blog/6589/exercise-as-a-cure-for-fatigue-and-to-boost-energy-levels\" target=\"_new\">help you overcome excuses</a> and boost your energy level through fitness.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Oct. 2, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Emergency departments are becoming increasingly violent places as doctors bear the brunt of fallout from the opioid epidemic, a new survey shows.</p><p>Nearly half of American emergency physicians said they have been physically assaulted at work, and three in five report those assaults happened during the past year, according to a new poll commissioned by the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP).</p><p>Nearly seven in 10 of survey respondents said ER violence has increased over the past five years, with one-quarter reporting it has increased greatly.</p><p>\"Pretty much universally, they felt it's been getting worse,\" said ACEP President Dr. Vidor Friedman, who has himself been hit in the eye, punched in the chest and threatened with death while working in the emergency department.</p><p>Why? Opioids are playing a major role in the violence, doctors said.</p><p>Half of emergency physicians reported that at least half of all assaults are committed by people who are either seeking drugs or under the influence of drugs or alcohol, the poll found.</p><p>\"They go to the emergency department hoping to get some relief, from not just the pain but the symptoms of withdrawal,\" Friedman explained. \"These folks are agitated, they're desperate and they don't really have anywhere to turn.\"</p><p>Efforts to curb the opioid epidemic require doctors to check prescription databases for potential misuse of painkillers, said Dr. Teresa Murray Amato. She is chair of emergency medicine at Long Island Jewish Forest Hills in Forest Hills, N.Y.</p><p>\"This can lead to difficult conversations and at times outright threats to the physician when the physician denies the request,\" Amato said. </p><p>\"Personally, I have noticed over the past year that, on almost every shift, I have been confronted by violence or the threat of violence when I attempt to redirect a patient away from opiate prescriptions,\" she added. \"In the past, these kinds of situations were much less frequent.\"</p><p>Nearly all (97 percent) of the assaults were committed by patients, doctors said, although about 28 percent also involved a patient's family member or friend.</p><p> Friedman explained that \"you have people who are in a crisis, and they show up, and we kind of live in a McDonald's world. People want it hot and want it now, and want it exactly as they want it, and we can't always provide that.\"</p><p>And, Friedman added, \"We also live in a world where it seems to be increasingly OK to express your anger. For some folks, that leads to them being particularly violent.\"</p><p>But patients  are also paying the price for this continued violence.</p><p>About 80 percent of doctors said violence in the emergency department has harmed patient care, and about half said patients have been physically harmed while seeking ER treatment.</p><p>These assaults keep emergency department physicians and staff from performing effectively, inflict emotional trauma and anxiety on patients, and increase wait times for treatment, doctors said.</p><p> Dr. Robert Glatter is an emergency physician with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He said, \"Physical and verbal attacks on emergency department staff can lead to long-term psychological effects, including anxiety as well as PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder]. Not only is patient care disrupted, but time devoted to critical emergencies is diverted to address these incidents.\" </p><p>Assaults on emergency physicians most often involved hitting or slapping (44 percent), spitting on them (30 percent), punching them (28 percent), kicking them (27 percent) or scratching them (17 percent), the findings showed.</p><p>Part of the problem is that people who carry out an assault in an emergency department rarely face consequences, Friedman said.</p><p>The poll found that nearly seven in 10 doctors said their hospital reported the incident to police. But hospital security only pressed charges in 3 percent of those cases, and hospital administrations advised doctors to press charges in only 6 percent of cases.</p><p>\"I've been assaulted a number of times in the emergency department and every time it's happened the hospital asked me to not press charges,\" Friedman said. \"If we don't press charges, we're telling our caregivers in the emergency department that it's OK for people to assault you, and it's not.\"</p><p>Hospitals also need to step up security measures, including more security guards and even metal detectors for some emergency departments, Friedman said.</p><p>\"Hospitals need to understand that the emergency department is a place that's open to the world,\" he added.</p><p>Friedman also would like to see tougher penalties for those who attack emergency department staff.</p><p>\"If a caregiver is assaulted, the penalties for that should be the same as if you're assaulting a police officer or firefighter,\" Friedman said.</p><p>More than 3,500 emergency physicians across the nation were surveyed for the poll. The results were scheduled for  presentation Tuesday at the ACEP's annual meeting in San Diego.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Emergency Nurses Association has more about <a href=\"https://www.ena.org/practice-resources/workplace-violence\" target=\"_new\"> violence in the emergency department</a>.</p>",

He is a doctoral student at Northwestern University, in Evanston, Ill.</p><p>The questionnaires assessed each person on five well-established personality traits: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness.</p><p>Gerlach and his team fed these into the computer to see if people would tend to cluster around similar levels of shared personality traits.</p><p>The investigators found at least four clusters, which they compared to \"lumps in the batter,\" Gerlach said.</p><p>The first is the \"Average\" personality type, which is characterized by average scores in all traits, the researchers said.</p><p>The other three clusters are roughly organized along the traits of neuroticism (level of emotional stability) and extraversion (the quality of being outgoing):</p><ul><li>\"Reserved\" personalities are emotionally stable but not particularly extraverted. They also are somewhat agreeable and conscientious.</li><li>\"Self-Centered\" personalities score high in extraversion and below average in openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness. \"It's not very nice to interact with these kinds of people,\" Gerlach said.</li><li>\"Role Models\" are low in neuroticism and high in all the other traits. They are agreeable, thoughtful and well-organized.</li></ul><p>These clusters were found thanks to four large data sets comprising more than a million people, obtained from different studies performed around the world, Gerlach noted.</p><p>\"It was previously unthinkable to obtain this amount of data,\" Gerlach said.</p><p>Not everyone will fall into one of these personality types, he added, and some people may even fall somewhere in the middle between two of them.</p><p>Your specific personality type is not set in stone, either, he explained.</p><p>For example, researchers speculate that the younger you are, the more likely you will be to fall within the Self-Centered category, particularly if you're a teenage boy, Gerlach said.</p><p>But with age and seasoning, a good number of these people could evolve into Role Models.</p><p>\"We would expect people to move from one personality type to another personality type,\" Gerlach said. \"The chances are that older people are more likely to be close to the Role Model personality type. You could describe these people as 'nice' people.\"</p><p>The discovery of these clusters runs counter to much of current psychological theory, which has concluded that personality categories don't exist, the study authors said.</p><p> Senior researcher Luis Nunes Amaral is a professor of chemical and biological engineering at Northwestern Engineering. \"Personality types only existed in self-help literature, and did not have a place in scientific journals. Now, we think this will change because of this study,\" he said in a university news release.</p><p>These clusters could help people predict how well you'll succeed in a given job, or your vulnerability to certain mental or emotional disorders, Gerlach said.</p><p>Psychologists have greeted that notion -- and these new findings -- with some skepticism, however.</p><p> James Maddux, a professor emeritus of psychology with George Mason University, said, \"I have no qualms about the methodology and statistics, but I have serious doubts about the clinical utility of yet another instrument that categorizes people into types.\" Maddux was not involved with the study.</p><p>\"For 40 years or more, clinical psychology has been moving away from using the assessment of personality traits and types to inform treatment and increasingly toward using assessments of people's problematic thoughts, feelings and behaviors as they occur in specific problematic situations, which is the essence of cognitive-behavioral therapy,\" Maddux said.</p><p>\"I doubt that many clinical psychology doctoral programs in the U.S. or Canada would add this instrument to their course or courses on psychological assessment,\" he added.</p><p>But New York City psychiatrist Dr. Timothy Sullivan said, \"Given the numbers of subjects they assessed, it suggests we need take this seriously. There is something meaningful here.\"</p><p>However, it's not clear how useful these categories will be in dealing with people's mental health issues, said Sullivan, chair of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Staten Island University Hospital.</p><p>\"I think the question for us in psychiatry is, is it meaningful to us clinically?\" Sullivan said. \"Does it help us to think about how we might help people who have problems coping in life? In that regard, we would need to play around with these categories and see whether or not they represent something meaningful in a clinical setting.\"</p><p>The study was published Sept. 17 in the journal <i>Nature Human Behavior</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Psychological Association has more about <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/topics/personality/\" target=\"_new\">personality</a>.</p>",

But the drug -- which had sales of more than $12 billion in 2017 -- also comes with a warning for a higher risk of cancer and severe, potentially lethal infections.</p><p>According to the lawsuit, AbbVie footed the bill for physicians' meals, drinks and travel, all in an effort to induce them to write more Humira prescriptions.</p><p>Nurses were also involved in the scheme, the lawsuit alleges. According to Jones' agency, AbbVie would send nurses to the homes of patients already taking Humira. Once there, the nurses would present themselves as an extension of the prescribing doctor's office, but in reality they were planted in patients' homes to dissuade or block concerns or complaints regarding Humira.</p><p>Doctors benefited from the \"free\"nurses, as well, Jones said, noting that the nurses often took care of cumbersome paperwork for physicians.</p><p>\"If given the choice between two medications, one which comes with free nurses and administrative staff and another that requires the provider to pay professional salaries, the provider cannot but help factor the substantial nursing kickback into their prescribing calculus,\" the lawsuit said.  The state's lawsuit is based on testimony provided by an AbbVie nurse, the <i>AP</i> noted.</p><p>In the meantime, insurance companies in California shelled out more than $1.2 billion for Humira for thousands of patients in the state between 2013 and mid-2018.</p><p>But AbbVie called the charges \"without merit.\"</p><p>\"AbbVie operates in compliance with the many state and federal laws that govern interactions with health care providers and patients,\" the company's statement said.</p><p>As for the nursing care it provides, AbbVie said that this is given to help educate patients and help with therapy and \"in no way replace or interfere with interactions between patients and their health care providers.\"</p>",

The goal was to gain fresh insight into vaping, which has been the most popular means for smoking among American youth since 2014.</p><p>One of every 11 students overall said he or she had ever used marijuana in an e-cigarette.</p><p>\"That equates to more than 2 million youth who have ever used cannabis in an e-cigarette,\" noted lead investigator Katrina Trivers. She is a lead epidemiologist in the office on smoking and health with the U.S. National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Among those who said they have ever used an e-cigarette at all, 1 in 3 high schoolers and 1 in 4 middle schoolers said they had used pot by vaping it.</p><p>Trivers said the findings point to seemingly dramatic shifts underway in how and what teens smoke.</p><p>\"Although we've seen considerable declines in the use of regular cigarettes among U.S. youth over the past several decades, the tobacco product landscape is evolving, and the use of other tobacco products has become increasingly popular,\" she said.</p><p>For example, Trivers noted that e-cigarette use shot up by 900 percent between 2011 and 2015 among American high schoolers, before declining somewhat in 2016 and holding steady in 2017.</p><p>\"This high rate of cannabis use in e-cigarettes is a public health concern, because any form of tobacco product use is unsafe among youth, irrespective of whether it's smoked, smokeless or electronic,\" she stressed.</p><p>On that front, Trivers pointed out that National Academies of Science has stated that pot use among youth \"can adversely affect learning and memory, and may impair later academic achievement and education.\"</p><p>More broadly, she noted that the U.S. Surgeon General \"has concluded that the aerosol emitted from e-cigarettes is not harmless,\" based on its nicotine and chemical compound content.</p><p>Trivers explained that e-cigarettes heat liquid compounds to create a vapor that contains nicotine, flavorings and other additives, which users inhale.</p><p>By simply adding hash oils, waxes and other liquids that contain pot's active ingredient directly into the e-liquid section, teens can turn an e-cig into a pot-delivery device.</p><p>Trivers noted that the survey found that pot vaping was \"significantly higher\" among boys. It was also more common among high schoolers.</p><p>\"Use was also higher among those who had used e-cigarettes more recently and more frequently,\" she added, as well as among students who said they use other tobacco products and/or live with someone who uses tobacco products.</p><p>Regardless, the researchers concluded that the survey showed pot use in e-cigs is as popular -- or perhaps more popular -- than believed.</p> <p>The findings were published online Sept. 17 as a letter to the editor in the journal <i>JAMA Pediatrics</i>.</p><p>Going forward, Trivers said the focus should be on \"ensuring that youth are aware of the risks of using all forms of tobacco products, including e-cigarettes,\" and on regulating e-cigarettes in the same manner as other tobacco products.</p><p>But Richard Miech, principal investigator of the \"Monitoring the Future\" project for the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research, believes that e-cig use among adolescents will continue to rise in the coming year.</p><p>Still, on a positive note, he pointed to the warning issued last week by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that threatened to take vaping devices off the market if manufacturers don't find ways to stem adolescent use.</p><p>\"This is a forceful step that will hopefully reduce adolescents' access to these devices,\" Miech said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more information on electronic cigarettes at the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/Labeling/ProductsIngredientsComponents/ucm456610.htm\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Sept. 17, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- As deadly fentanyl is increasingly mixed into heroin and other street drugs, some drug abusers are getting smart, a new study finds.</p><p>Fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, has triggered a sharp increase in overdose deaths over the past few years. The drug is to blame for 44 percent of overdose deaths in New York City alone, according to New York University researchers.</p> <p>Now, at least some drug users in the city are adjusting their behavior to avoid overdosing, according to interviews with addicts.</p><p>\"Nearly all study participants were knowledgeable about minimizing their risk for overdose and many reported using methods to reduce their risk,\" said study lead author Courtney McKnight, a clinical assistant professor at NYU College of Global Public Health. </p><p>Still, most users \"were not consistent in applying these methods\" each time they got high, McKnight said.</p><p>In the survey, 55 drug users were interviewed at three needle exchange programs in New York City. Many voiced apprehension about using drugs that could contain fentanyl.</p><p>Some said they had begun using \"test shots\" -- initially injecting a small amount of a drug to assess its strength. Some said they use test shots every time they inject drugs. Others do so only when they suspect the drug was cut with fentanyl, the researchers explained.</p><p>A few programs distribute fentanyl test strips to avoid life-threatening overdoses, and users said they were trying them, too.</p><p>More than two-thirds of the drug users carried naloxone, a medication used to reverse opioid overdoses, at least half of the time.</p><p>Several participants said they had either used naloxone to revive someone else or had the drug administered to them.  </p><p>A few said they turned to drugs less often since the surge in fentanyl-fueled overdoses.</p><p>\"Using methods to reduce the risk of overdose was often complicated by structural factors such as stigma, poverty and homelessness, which were further complicated by dependence and the increased prevalence of fentanyl,\" McKnight said in an NYU news release.</p><p>There is not one approach that will prevent overdose deaths among hundreds of thousands of drug users. But the researchers stressed all strategies should be used to help save lives.</p><p>Supervised injection sites, like those New York City plans to open, are another method that can prevent overdose deaths, said study co-author Don Des Jarlais, a professor of epidemiology. \"These sites provide a medically supervised space with readily available naloxone, sterile injecting equipment, and safe disposal of used syringes,\" he said.</p><p>The study was published recently in the <i>International Journal of Drug Policy</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse provides more facts about <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates\" target=\"_new\">overdose death rates</a>.</p>",

Just choose whole fruit rather than juice to get all its nutrition, including fiber.</p><p>Beans and other legumes -- such as chickpeas, black-eyed peas and red lentils -- are versatile carb powerhouses with a punch of protein, too.</p><p>Healthy whole grains also deserve a place in your diet. Whole wheat breads and pastas, rolled oats, rye, barley and quinoa have the nutrients that refined white flour products are missing. Ditto on replacing white rice with more wholesome brown rice varieties.</p><p>Beware of other starches, primarily white potatoes. They don't even count as a vegetable on Harvard University's Healthy Eating Plate because they're high in the type of carb that the body digests quickly, resulting in a blood sugar and insulin surge, then dip -- just like soda and candy. People also typically eat them in a fat-filled form, such as chips or fries, or mashed with tons of butter.</p><p>Replace them with sweet potatoes, but go easy on portion size and don't load them with added sugar and fat. Even better, try roasting hard winter squashes, delicious on their own or with just a hint of cinnamon.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For links to everything you need to know about <a href=\"https://www.nutrition.gov/subject/whats-in-food/carbohydrates-proteins-fats-fiber/carbohydrates\" target=\"_new\">carbohydrates</a>, visit Nutrition.gov.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 1, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Price Woodward was the picture of health at age 52. He lived an active lifestyle and ran marathons. He was definitely not the type of person you'd expect to have a stroke. </p><p>But one night, his wife, Tammy, heard a strange noise coming from the other side of the bed. She turned on the light and Price started talking to her, but she couldn't understand what he was saying. </p><p>Tammy could tell something wasn't right, so she called 911. But because Price had the stroke in his sleep and his wife had no way of knowing exactly when the stroke began, he wasn't eligible for clot-busting medication that can sometimes stop a stroke before much damage is done. </p><p>\"His stroke was really bad. It affected the left side of his body, and he couldn't even sit up. If I hadn't been home, I think he would've died. It's been a long road to recovery,\" Tammy said. </p><p>But Price, who lives in Greensboro, Ga., had a lot of motivation to go through stroke rehabilitation to get better. His middle daughter got engaged after he'd had the stroke, and he was determined to be there for her wedding day. </p><p>\"I told my therapist I was going to walk her down the aisle,\" he said.</p><p>Stroke therapy is very specific, tailored rehab. Tammy explained that even though Price started rehabilitation in a wheelchair, his therapist helped him achieve the goal of walking. She calculated how many steps it would be, how his gait might affect his balance, and even considered how the train of the dress would play into his walking down the aisle. </p><p>Lots of hard work paid off. Not only did Price escort his middle daughter down the aisle, he was also able to attend his youngest daughter's graduation and welcome his oldest daughter's first child. </p><p>But as far as he's come in recovery, Price knows that if he could have gotten help faster, things might have been very different. </p><p>A friend of his also had a stroke, but it happened in front of the friend's family. His friend was able to get to the hospital right away and received the clot-buster drug called TPA. His friend was essentially back to normal in four months, Price said. </p><p>In comparison, Price is still recovering from his stroke four years later. </p><p>\"If you see someone having a stroke, make a note of what time it is,\" he advised, because doctors will want to know what time the symptoms began. </p><p>Dr. Olajide Williams, director of acute stroke services at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, agreed that acting quickly can save lives. An easy way to remember what to look out for is the acronym FAST: </p><ul><li><b>F</b> is for face. If one half of the face droops when you ask someone to smile or show their teeth, that person may be having a stroke.</li><li><b>A</b> is for arm. Ask the person to raise both arms. If someone is having a stroke, one arm won't go up at all or may not go up as much and then goes down quickly. </li><li><b>S</b> is for speech. Talking gibberish or slurring words might be a sign of a stroke. </li><li><b>T</b> is for time to call 911. \"Time is brain. Every minute that a stroke is allowed to continue, you lose 2 million brain cells. The more brain cells that die, the less the chance is for reversing the stroke with treatment,\" Williams said. </li></ul><p>There's usually a three-hour window from the time stroke symptoms begin until you can receive treatment with TPA, or in certain cases, 4.5 hours. With endovascular (blood vessel) treatments, you have six hours from the first symptoms, Williams said. </p> <p>Don't try to drive yourself to the hospital, he said. \"The call to 911 is critical. It bypasses any waiting. The ambulance notifies the hospital and that activates the hospital system and stroke team,\" he added. </p><p>Williams also cautioned not to think you're immune from stroke if you're younger. He said strokes are occurring in younger people, especially in communities with more obesity and diabetes. </p><p>Like Price, Williams wants people to know there is life after stroke. \"Even if an individual doesn't receive acute treatment, rehabilitation can improve function and accelerate recovery,\" Williams said. </p><p>More than 7 million Americans aged 20 and older have had a stroke, according to the American Stroke Association. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about FAST and spotting a stroke from the <a href=\"https://www.strokeassociation.org/STROKEORG/WarningSigns/Stroke-Warning-Signs-and-Symptoms_UCM_308528_SubHomePage.jsp\" target=\"_new\">American Stroke Association</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Sept. 17, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- True to its storm-of-the-century hype, Hurricane Florence pounded the Carolinas with historic rainfall and catastrophic flooding -- and continuing danger looms in its wake.</p><p>Infection and injury are the big threats as cleanup begins, and experts say it's important to be smart as you tackle the dirty work.</p><p>\"The 'it's-not-going-to-happen-to-me' attitude is what gets people killed and injured,\" said Dr. Ryan Stanton, a critical care specialist and spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians. \"The assumption everybody has to make is that everything is sharp and everything is contaminated.\"</p><p>Be aware of the potential risks, wear protective gear and ask for help if you need it, health experts advise. </p><p>In particular, you should leave the work to others if your immune system is compromised, either by underlying disease or because you are taking immunosuppressants. And know your limits: If you've never used power tools such as a chain saw, get help from someone who knows what they're doing. </p><p> Dr. Luis Ostrosky is a professor at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth in Houston and a fellow of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. He said that \"it's important to clean up as soon as possible, but also to be as safe as possible.\" </p><p>Stanton and Ostrosky offer these tips for a safe storm recovery: </p><ul><li><b>Beware hidden dangers in the water:</b> Floodwater is full of nasty stuff -- from untreated sewage and livestock waste to venomous bugs and snakes. The longer water sits, the more germ-laden it gets. Avoid contact with it and wash up thoroughly with soap and water after you work. If you accidentally ingest contaminated water, your risk of infection is high. See a doctor if you develop any symptoms, especially a high fever and jaundice, signs of a potentially deadly disease called leptospirosis, Ostrosky said.</li><li><b>Watch out for electrical hazards:</b> Standing water can be electrically charged if live wires are beneath it. Never enter floodwaters or a dwelling that is flooded without knowing for certain that the power has been shut off either at the house or at the neighborhood level. Call an electrician if you aren't sure.</li><li><b>Take steps to avoid insect bites:</b> Remove standing water to eliminate breeding grounds for mosquitoes, which spread serious illnesses like West Nile virus and encephalitis. Be aware that ant colonies may be present in floodwater. Their bites can cause a life-threatening allergic reaction. </li><li><b>Gear up:</b> Wear heavy gloves, closed-toe (preferably steel-toe) shoes, long sleeves and pants, as well as eye protection. If fecal contamination is likely, wear rubber boots and rubber gloves. If you're working around mold, you'll need an N-95 mask or heavy-duty respirator. </li><li><b>Tool safety is key:</b> After storms, emergency rooms see a lot of injuries caused by power tools -- especially chain saws. \"If you don't have a lot of experience with power tools, you have to be extra careful,\" Stanton said. Make sure your chain saw is the right size for the job, follow directions for its use and beware of kickback. That's an uncontrolled reaction caused when the blade hits metal or wood that can cause serious injury. </li><li><b>Keep hydrated:</b> As you work, drink plenty of water, take frequent breaks and avoid working in the heat of the day. </li><li><b>Have a buddy:</b> If you are going to do significant repair work or have medical problems, make sure someone knows where you are and what you're doing so help can be summoned if needed.</li><li><b>Debris can be dangerous:</b> Watch your step around broken glass and wood, rusty nails and fallen or weakened branches. Remember that trees uproot easily in saturated ground. When cutting trees or branches that are bent or caught on something else, avoid contact with power lines and take extra care. </li><li><b>Wound care is urgent:</b> Falls from ladders and rooftops often happen during cleanup, but cuts and scrapes are the most common post-storm injuries. Tend to them quickly, washing and disinfecting wounds. If signs of infection such as redness or pus develop, seek medical attention, Ostrosky said. If you get injured and haven't had a tetanus shot in more than five years, the doctor will likely recommend one.</li><li><b>Prevent mold:</b> Record rainfall means mold. \"If not properly treated afterwards, you have potentially years of long-term exposure to mold,\" Stanton said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends removing saturated drywall and insulation as soon as possible to reduce the health risk. Open doors and windows and use fans to circulate air. Toss anything you can't clean or dry quickly, and clean wet surfaces, using a mixture of 1 cup household bleach to 1 gallon water. </li></ul><p>\"Understand that there are going to be risks and dangers,\" Stanton said, \"and that these are going to evolve over time. Just be safe.\"</p><p> Ostrosky added, \"You will get through this.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more disaster cleanup tips, visit the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/cleanup/facts.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

It's easier to stick to a schedule when you ink it in your calendar. Even if you can get there only two or three times a week, make the commitment -- being consistent is the only way to get results.</p><p>Another mistake is not adjusting exercise equipment to your size and your abilities. That means small but important changes like moving the seat and back positions on weight machines for the best positioning. That's just as necessary as moving the pin on the weight stack. If not, you're likely to use bad form, and that can lead to injuries.</p><p>Speaking of form, take advantage of the availability of gym staff to make sure you're using correct form, whether in a yoga class or strength training. A trainer's objective eye can help you move through your full range of motion.</p><p>Resist getting into a competition with other gym members, even if it's only in your head. Embrace the spirit of camaraderie so that you can motivate each other.</p><p>Avoid settling into a predictable pattern. One advantage of a gym is the variety it offers, from equipment to classes. So don't get locked into a \"forever\" routine. That can erode your motivation and lead to fitness plateaus and even an overuse injury.</p><p>Finally, don't forget good gym manners. Leave your phone in your locker, but remember a towel so you can wipe off any sweat as you finish working on each piece of equipment.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Council on Exercise has an infographic on <a href=\"https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/professional/expert-articles/6424/top-10-mistakes-people-make-in-the-gym?pageID=523\" target=\"_new\">mistakes</a> to avoid in the gym.</p>",

Because they don't give off radiation and can be given easily in a medical office, they're a popular imaging choice to diagnose heart disease. But, Dr. Rahul Deo, the study's senior author, said they're not done enough because the process of assessing results is long and taxing.</p>    <p>\"It can be tedious to collect everything and interpret all that information. You need specialists on both ends, both to acquire the data and to interpret it, so it often becomes a tool that's used when there are already symptoms or when (heart) disease has sort of already progressed,\" said Deo, chief data scientist at One Brave Idea, an organization centered on finding new ways to fight heart disease. It is partially funded by the American Heart Association. </p>    <p>Conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure, risk factors for cardiovascular disease, often change the structure and function of the heart muscle years before the onset of any symptoms, he said. \"We wanted to figure out how to get studies done at an earlier level &#8230; picking up severe cases earlier on, even when people don't have any symptoms.\" </p>    <p>Looking at 14,035 echocardiograms, collected over 10 years from a University of California San Francisco database, researchers fed 23 views of each heart chamber from every test into a computer algorithm. They also provided labels for every specific, identifiable image captured.</p>    <p>The result was a set of programs that, ultimately, independently identified images, provided measurements and spotted potential problems. Deo said automating echocardiogram interpretation could help \"democratize\" the tests, allowing them to be conducted in more settings, such as primary care offices or rural areas that lack cardiologists and other medical specialists.</p>    <p>An estimated 7.7 million echocardiograms were performed in U.S. hospitals from 2001 to 2011, a period that saw the use of the tests grow at an average annual rate of 3.41 percent, according to one study.</p>    <p>The process of assessing echocardiograms is still a long way off before there's no longer a need for human expertise, said Dr. Mario Garcia, chief of cardiology at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. </p>    <p>\"To arrive at a diagnosis and decide upon a treatment, you need not only the interpretation of the images, but you need to know the patient's symptoms and incorporate that with other medical information that's available -- like what's the patient's blood pressure, and what have other tests that have been conducted show?\" said Garcia, who was not part of the study. </p>    <p>Garcia, who estimates his hospital conducts anywhere between 25,000 to 30,000 echocardiograms a year, said the accuracy of the automated measurements in the study demonstrate \"a real advancement\" in technology, but disease detection isn't foolproof.</p>    <p>\"You may have the diagnosis being made correctly 85 percent of the time, but what do you do in the other 15 percent if you are wrong?\" he said. \"A 15 percent error in medicine is not an acceptable rate.\"</p>    <p>Garcia compared it to the automation of the stock market over the past several decades. </p>    <p>\"The development of computers was important for getting data in the stock market,\" he said, \"but deciding whether to use that data to actually make an investment still requires a human being.\"</p>",

He is chief medical officer for the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center insurance services division.</p><p>The presence of competition tends to hold down price increases that occur during a shortage, the researchers also found.</p><p>Drugs made by three or fewer manufacturers can be expected to increase about 13 percent in price during a shortage, compared with just 8 percent price hikes during shortages affecting medicines supplied by more than three manufacturers, the study found.</p><p>\"This effect was stronger in drugs that were supplied by three or less manufacturers,\" said lead researcher Inmaculada Hernandez, an assistant professor of pharmacy and therapeutics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy.</p><p>For their study, the researchers drew data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's database on drug shortages.</p><p>The investigators identified 90 drugs that underwent an active shortage in 2016, and tracked pricing data for 11 months prior to and following each shortage, to see how prices were affected.</p><p>Prices of drugs increased by about 7 percent in the 11 months prior to a shortage, but about 16 percent in the 11 months after a shortage began, the findings showed.</p><p>Prices of drugs supplied by three or fewer manufacturers increased by 12 percent before and 27 percent following a shortage. For drugs supplied by more than three manufacturers, prices increased by 2.5 percent and 4.8 percent in the 11 months before and after the shortage began, respectively.</p><p>The findings were published online Sept. 17 in the <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p>Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) referred requests for comment to the Association for Accessible Medicines (AAM), a trade group for generic drug manufacturers.</p><p>The AAM said more recent events have overtaken this study, rendering its conclusions outdated.</p><p> \"For the past two years since this study's short and dated snapshot in time, the generic industry has averaged 7 percent deflation of its prices,\" said Allen Goldberg, the AAM's vice president of communications. \"We are working with government and industry to address the low reimbursement for generic drugs, which is the root cause of many shortages.\"</p><p>But the findings were \"not surprising\" to Claire McAndrew, director of campaigns and partnerships for Families USA, a health care consumer advocacy group.</p><p>\"The results of this study are quantifying drug company behaviors we have witnessed during public health crises and drug shortages before,\" McAndrew said. \"I think it's quite common that we see drug companies leveraging public health crises or drug shortages for huge profits.\"</p><p>As an example, McAndrew pointed to skyrocketing prices during the opioid epidemic for naloxone (Narcan), the lifesaving medicine that can reverse an opioid overdose.</p><p>\"The entire drug pricing system right now is set up to allow profiting off of health crises, but there are steps policymakers can take related to the pricing system and the patent system to improve the way the system works for health care consumers,\" McAndrew explained.</p><p>Lawmakers could make it easier for generic versions of drugs to hit the market, improving price competition, McAndrew said. They also could craft other policies that discourage price gouging during shortages.</p><p> Shrank suggested that one tactic might be to cap the amount of price increase that can occur in the setting of a shortage.</p><p>\"We could easily make an exception if there was some extenuating circumstance like a natural disaster,\" Shrank said. \"In the absence of that, it seems reasonable to create a cap on drug prices during a shortage.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Hospital Association has more about <a href=\"https://www.aha.org/2017-12-11-high-rising-drug-prices-myth-vs-fact\" target=\"_new\">rising drug prices</a>.</p>",

The disease claims nearly 450,000 lives around the world each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p><p> People diagnosed with the disease can be treated with drugs that destroy the replicating form of the parasite, but dormant sexual forms may remain, the researchers explained.</p><p>These dormant parasites can be transmitted to mosquitoes that bite infected people. Once transferred, these dormant parasites mature, multiply and gather in the mosquito's salivary glands where they are ready to infect others who are bitten by the insect.</p><p>But the researchers identified compounds that could stop the spread of malaria by making malaria parasites incapable of infecting mosquitoes.  After screening more than 70,000 compounds, the team pinpointed six with the potential to become malaria-blocking drugs.</p><p>Once in mosquitoes, sexual malaria parasites are very active, which makes them ideal drug targets. To identify compounds that could interfere with these sexual parasites, the researchers tricked the parasites into replicating. </p><p>\"Overall, we screened around 70,000 molecules and found only a handful of potent compounds that are both active and safe to use with human cells,\" Baum said. \"It was like finding needles in a haystack.\"</p><p>The scientists are researching all the compounds to determine exactly how they work and how they could be developed into drugs that are stable enough to be given to person and survive being ultimately transferred to mosquitoes.</p><p>The findings were published Sept. 18 in the journal <i>Nature Communications</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/malaria/index.html\" target=\"_new\"> malaria</a>.</p>",

They could last a day, a weekend or even longer.</p><p>Not sure where to start your search? You might give your local hospital or health system a call to see whether they're sponsoring any health events. Another option is to simply google the words \"fitness expo near me,\" and then research the organizing group to be sure the speakers and instructors have excellent fitness credentials.</p>",

None smoked and all had uncomplicated pregnancies, which resulted in a healthy baby. After their babies were born, the researchers examined the placenta.</p><p>The team looked for specific immune cells called placental macrophages, which swallow up harmful particles like bacteria and pollution particles.</p><p> Overall, the researchers analyzed 3,500 macrophage cells under a high-powered microscope. They found 60 cells that contained a combined total of 72 small black areas, which were thought to be carbon particles. On average, each placenta contained about five square micrometers of this substance.</p><p>Using an electron microscope, the investigators examined the macrophages from two of the placentas in more detail. They found the same suspected carbon particles from the air.</p><p>\"We were not sure if we were going to find any particles and if we did find them, we were only expecting to find a small number of placental macrophages that contain these sooty particles,\" Liu said. \"This is because most of them should be engulfed by macrophages within the airways.\"</p><p>These findings underscore previous studies, which have linked air pollution to premature birth, low birth weight, infant death and lung issues among children.</p><p>According to Mina Gaga, president of the European Respiratory Society, \"Previous research shows that pregnant women living in polluted cities are more prone to pregnancy issues such as restricted fetal growth, premature birth and low birth weight babies.\"  Gaga was not involved in the new study. </p><p>\"This new research suggests a possible mechanism of how babies are affected by pollution while being theoretically protected in the womb,\" she added. \"We need stricter policies for cleaner air to reduce the impact of pollution on health worldwide.\"</p><p>The study findings were presented Sunday at the European Respiratory Society International Congress, in Paris.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences has more on <a href=\"https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/air-pollution/index.cfm\" target=\"_new\"> air pollution</a>.</p>",

Vaccine maker Merck has a stockpile of 300,000 doses, and preparing them takes months, the <i>AP</i> reported.</p><p>\"We are extremely concerned about the size of the vaccine stockpile,\" Dr. Peter Salama, emergencies director, World Health Organization, said in an interview with the STAT media outlet this week.</p><p>He said 300,000 doses is not sufficient as Ebola outbreaks in cities become more common, the <i>AP</i> reported.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Whole Grain-Rules for School Lunches Rolled Back by Trump Administration</b></span></p><p>Foods made mostly of refined grains and low-fat chocolate milk will once again be allowed in the U.S. school lunch program, as the Trump administration changes standards introduced under the Obama administration.</p><p>Under the previous rules, only whole grains could be served and only fat-free milk could be flavored, the <i>Associated Press</i> reported.</p><p>The Trump administration is also scrapping a final target for limiting sodium, but schools will still have to meet reduced sodium standards.</p><p>Only half the grains served will have to be whole grains, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Thursday. Products affected include noodles, tortillas, biscuits and grits, the <i>AP</i> reported.</p><p>The whole grain-only rule was too difficult for some districts to meet, according to the School Nutrition Association, which represents local cafeteria operators and food companies.</p><p>But the American Heart Association urged schools to \"stay the course\" and meet the stricter standards that started taking effect in 2012, and the Center for Science in the Public Interest said reversing the whole-grain requirement makes no sense because most schools were already in compliance, the <i>AP</i> reported.</p><p>The school lunch program, which provides low-cost or free lunches, served about 30 million children last year.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Study That Targeted \"Joy of Cooking\" Retracted by Journal</b></span></p><p>A study that targeted the \"Joy of Cooking\" has been retracted because of problems with the data, the journal <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i> says.</p><p>The 2009 study claimed that recipes in updated editions of the cookbook were changed to have more calories and larger portions, the <i>Associated Press</i> reported.</p><p>The study analyzed the cookbook's recipes as part of an investigation into whether home cooking might be a factor in rising obesity rates.</p><p>The study co-author was Brian Wansink, who recently resigned from Cornell University after school officials said he engaged in academic misconduct, including misreporting of data, the <i>AP</i> reported.</p><p>Wansink's work has been widely cited and he has influenced U.S. dietary guidelines.</p><p>Several of Wansink's studies have been retracted since a blog post he wrote in 2016 led to questions about the validity of his work.

High meat consumption has negative consequences for people's health and the environment, according to scientists at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.</p><p>For the study, the research team surveyed 1,112 U.S. adults to investigate consumers' views on meat consumption and their eating habits over the past three years.</p><p>The investigators found that 66 percent of those polled were eating less of at least one type of meat.</p><p>\"Many Americans continue to have strong preferences for meat, but this survey adds to a growing body of evidence that a significant portion of the population may be purposefully reducing their meat consumption without becoming vegetarian or vegan,\" said study leader Roni Neff. She is an assistant professor in the Bloomberg School's department of environmental health and engineering.</p><p>\"We hope our findings will be useful for the development of awareness campaigns and other interventions geared towards helping consumers reduce their meat consumption in a way that is good for their health, their grocery budgets, and the environment,\" Neff added in a university news release.</p><p>Of those surveyed, 55 percent said they were reducing their consumption of processed meat and 41 percent were cutting back on red meat. Thirty-seven percent said they had increased the amount of poultry and seafood in their diet.</p> <p>Sixty-four percent said they curbed their meat intake by buying less meat, 56 percent by reducing portion sizes, 42 percent by having meatless meals, 32 percent by choosing to have meatless days and 9 percent by avoiding meat entirely. Most of those eating more meatless meals reported opting for vegetables instead. Other meat alternatives included cheese and additional dairy products and eggs. </p><p>Survey respondents aged 45 to 59 were twice as likely to cut their  intake of one or more types of meat as younger adults aged 18 to 29. And women were more likely to eat less meat than men, the findings showed. </p><p>In most cases, the respondents said they cut back on meat to save money or protect their health. Those with annual household annual incomes of less than $25,000 were more likely to cut back on meat, poultry or fish than those with incomes exceeding $75,000. The researchers noted that parents with children were less likely than adults without kids to eat less meat.</p><p>Fewer people made the decision to reduce meat at mealtime out of concern for the welfare of animals or the environment. Those who chose not to curb their intake felt that meat was essential for a healthy diet.</p><p>The survey findings could serve as the basis for new campaigns to raise awareness about nutrition, plant-based meals and the environmental effects of meat production, the researchers suggested.</p><p>The report was published recently in the journal <i>Public American Nutrition</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. National Institutes of Health has more about eating <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-red-meat\" target=\"_new\">red meat</a>.</p>",

But if the group doesn't practice giving, you probably won't either, researchers say. </p><p>This finding is based on a six-year study of the Hadza hunter-gatherer people in Tanzania. Their lives have remained mostly unchanged for hundreds of years. </p><p>\"The Hadza are one of the last populations left on the planet who live a similar lifestyle to how our ancestors lived for millions of years,\" said study author Ibrahim Mabulla, of the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. \"They offer insight into how cooperation evolved.\"</p><p>If the researchers' conclusions are right, it might explain why modern humans cooperate with others, including strangers -- giving blood, for example, or tipping, despite getting nothing in return. </p><p>According to the report, the Hadza are usually willing to share, but not always. They change communal groups every couple of months, and fellow campmates strongly influence their tendency to share.</p> <p>\"We found individual willingness to share changed from year to year to match their current campmates and found no evidence that people preferred living with more cooperative people,\" said the study's first author, Kristopher Smith, of the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Sharing, the researchers concluded, is driven by local group norms and behavior, not individual altruism.</p><p>For the study, the researchers visited 56 Hadza camps over six years. They asked nearly 400 adults to play a game. In the game, people were given four honey straws, which they could either share with the group or not. If they shared, the total contribution to the group was tripled.</p><p>In some camps, everyone shared, and in some camps people shared very little. The researchers had expected all the camps would contribute similar amounts, but people acted differently over time, changing their behavior to match the norms of their current neighbors.</p><p>The report was published Sept. 20 in the journal <i>Current Biology</i>. </p><p>\"We were surprised to find that people do not have a stable tendency to cooperate and are instead influenced by those around them,\" lead author Coren Apicella, of the University of Pennsylvania, said in a journal news release. \"Our results show that there is no such thing as good guys and bad guys.\"</p><p>The moral may well be that your behavior can affect the behavior of those around you -- if you're generous yourself, you can get others to be generous, too.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>For more on human origins, visit the <a href=\"http://humanorigins.si.edu/human-characteristics\" target=\"_new\"> Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History</a>.</p>",

The best thing you can do is donate blood year around,\" said first study author Dr. M. James Lozada. He's  an assistant professor of anesthesiology at  Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Tennessee.</p><p>Lozada, who started the study while at Northwestern's School of Medicine in Chicago, explained that a typical blood donation takes two days to process, but most blood transfusions for shooting victims occur within the first 24 hours of the tragedy.</p><p>The study examined the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, which occurred in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, 2017. There were 58 deaths, 869 wounded people, and 220 hospital admissions, including at least 68 critical care admissions.</p><p>A public call for blood donations was announced during a news conference and widely reported by the media. In the three days after the shooting, the American Red Cross saw a 53 percent spike in blood donations nationwide.</p><p>The Las Vegas blood bank, United Blood Services, reported 791 blood donations immediately after the mass shooting. Of those donations, 137 (17 percent) went unused and were later discarded, compared to an average of 26 wasted donations per month at the blood bank.</p><p>The findings, which were published online Oct. 29 in <i>The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery</i>, showed that a call for immediate blood donation was unnecessary in Las Vegas and probably in other mass shootings, the authors said.</p><p>\"From our data, it is likely that the total one-day blood component transfusions needed in Las Vegas were more than in any mass shooting on record,\" Lozada said in a Northwestern news release.</p><p>\"One of the things that we propose in the paper is for cities to develop some protocols for these scenarios, where instead of issuing a blanket call for blood donation you would do it in a systematic way. As one suggestion, you might do it by ZIP code,\" he said.</p><p>\"Our findings are important to help us prepare for the next mass shooting in the United States. It shows us the amount of blood components we likely will need. It will also help first responders adequately prepare to save lives,\" Lozada added.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Red Cross explains how <a href=\"https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/how-to-donate/how-blood-donations-help.html\" target=\"_new\">blood donations help</a>.</p>",

Feinsilver's advice is to try to sleep a regular seven to eight hours -- and \"stick to a constant wake time.\"</p><p>Triggers such as light, food and exercise are the cues that tell your body what time it is.</p><p>\"Getting exposed to light early in the day wakes us up,\" Feinsilver said. \"This is harder in the winter when there is less and later light, but the autumn time shift helps a bit.\"</p><p>Dr. Daniel Barone is a neurologist and sleep medicine expert at the Center for Sleep Medicine at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City. He said that people shouldn't expect that the extra hour of sleep they'll get on Sunday will erase any accumulated \"sleep debt.\"</p><p>\"We as a society sleep one hour less than we did 100 years ago, so we are still 'behind the clock' so to speak when it comes to being sleep-deprived,\" Barone said.</p><p>He said the body's sleep clock can be directly affected as autumn days grow shorter and people spend more time indoors. The body manufactures vitamin D via sunlight's action on the skin, and too little vitamin D can affect sleep and emotions.</p><p>\"When you're not getting as much sunlight, it has an effect on your mood,\" Barone said. For some people, this can even mean the onset of a kind of depression known as seasonal affective disorder (SAD).</p><p>Barone offered these tips for better sleep:</p><ul><li>Switch to LED lightbulbs. They're made to simulate sunlight and can help you maintain a healthy circadian rhythm as seasons change.</li><li>Cut out the evening nap. Dozing off after dinner sends confusing signals to your brain that can make bedtime later more challenging.</li><li>Try mindful meditation. It can cut stress and encourage healthy sleep.</li><li>Ban TVs, smartphones and laptops from the bedroom. The backlight display can disrupt sleep if used before lights-out.</li><li>Keep bedrooms dark. Light creeping in can send a wake-up signal to the brain.</li></ul><p>If you're still having trouble sleeping, consult a sleep specialist for testing, Barone said.</p><p>\"If you're continually waking up in the night or you're constantly waking up tired, a sleep test is definitely warranted,\" he said.</p><p>\"We should view sleep as something that's sacred,\" Barone said. \"Our bodies are designed to get seven to nine hours. In this 24-hour society, a lot of times the amount of sleep we get suffers. We should focus on getting good-quality sleep and dealing with any problems that exist.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on getting good sleep at the <a href=\"https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-tools-tips/healthy-sleep-tips\" target=\"_new\">National Sleep Foundation</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Sept. 18, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- A new approach to preventing gout attacks looks promising for people not already helped by existing treatments.</p><p>Researchers are looking at an anti-inflammatory drug called canakinumab (Ilaris) to treat this painful form of arthritis. </p><p>Instead of targeting excessively high uric acid levels as existing gout drugs do, the new strategy aims to reduce overall inflammation. The drug goes after a specific inflammatory molecule called interleukin-1.</p><p>The result was a 50 percent drop in gout attack risk, the researchers found.</p><p>\"This was a very large effect,\" said study lead author Dr. Daniel Solomon, a rheumatologist with Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. </p><p>He acknowledged it was \"very surprising\" that the drug packed an equally protective punch whether patients had normal uric acid levels or very high levels.</p><p>But Ilaris is unlikely to be the preventive drug of choice any time soon, said Solomon.</p><p>For one, it has not yet received approval for gout treatment in the United States. And most patients already achieve risk reduction with standard uric acid-lowering treatments, such as allopurinol (brand names Zyloprim,  Aloprim).</p><p>What's more, decades-old allopurinol  is a cheap daily pill.</p><p>\"Canakinumab is very expensive,\" said Solomon. Its main role to date is as a last-ditch treatment for rare, so-called \"orphan\" diseases. At its current price, he said, \"it is not a viable option for most patients with gout.\"</p><p>Also, it must be injected every three months by a caregiver.</p><p>Still, Solomon said Ilaris may have a clinical role for patients who don't respond to or tolerate standard medications. </p><p>Prior research had shown that interleukin-1B inhibitors can shorten gout attacks, but it wasn't known if they could prevent them, the study authors said.</p>  <p>The new research was funded by Novartis, the maker of Ilaris. The results were published online Sept. 17 in <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p>Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. When a chemical called uric acid builds up in the body, it triggers the formation of tiny jagged crystals that cause severe joint paint, most often in the foot, particularly the big toe. Gout's prevalence has increased considerably in recent decades.</p><p>Heart disease and gout often overlap, the researchers noted. To explore whether Ilaris has potential as a preventive measure, investigators conducted a secondary analysis of the so-called Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study (CANTOS). This enlisted more than 10,000 heart attack patients to see if Ilaris might help reduce future cardiovascular complications among high-risk individuals.</p><p>The researchers found that patients treated with four injections of Ilaris a year faced half the risk for a gout attack, compared with those given a dummy (placebo) treatment, regardless of uric acid levels.</p><p>\"We have no strong reason to believe that [Ilaris] would be less effective in patients without known heart disease,\" said Solomon.</p><p>Howard Feinberg, a professor of rheumatology at Touro University in Vallejo, Calif., agreed. </p><p>Based on the current and prior research, \"we can assume that this drug will work for most patients,\" including those without a history of heart disease, he said.</p><p> Feinberg said he \"would not recommend its use for someone who did well on older medications\" because of its high cost and the need to give it as in injection. </p><p>\"The type of patient who would benefit the most is someone who was allergic or could not take standard therapy,\" Feinberg said, mentioning patients with kidney disease. \"This treatment is also ideal for someone whose gout could not be controlled on allopurinol or other older therapies.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about gout treatment at the <a href=\"https://www.arthritis.org/about-arthritis/types/gout/treatments/types.php/\" target=\"_new\">Arthritis Foundation</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, March 28, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Blood vessels created in the lab can successfully turn into \"living tissue\" in patients on dialysis for advanced kidney disease, a new study suggests.</p><p>The results come from just 13 patients in an early-phase trial. But researchers said they are a sign that the engineered tissue might eventually offer new treatment options for patients with damaged blood vessels -- due to conditions ranging from heart disease to traumatic injuries.</p><p>The study, published March 27 in <i>Science Translational Medicine</i>, involved kidney disease patients who were implanted with the lab-created blood vessels so they could receive dialysis.</p><p>Right now, the \"gold standard\" way to give patients dialysis is by creating a fistula, a kind of surgically-made passage, said Heather Prichard, senior researcher on the study.</p><p>To do that, a surgeon joins a vein and artery in the patient's arm or leg, which allows blood to travel through tubes into the dialysis machine, where toxins are removed.</p><p>But, Prichard said, some patients' veins are not strong enough.</p><p>In those cases, a synthetic implant may be used to join a vein and artery. But the implants can't mimic real vessels, and they carry a greater risk of blood clots and infections.</p><p>So Prichard and her colleagues at Humacyte, Inc. -- a Durham, N.C.-based biotech company -- took a different approach. They created blood vessels in the lab.</p><p>The researchers started with biodegradable, tube-like scaffolds, which they seeded with smooth muscle cells from deceased human donors. The scaffolds were then housed in a bioreactor system to develop for eight weeks. After that, researchers removed all cells from each structure, leaving behind a matrix that essentially provided the outer shell of a blood vessel.</p><p>The idea, Prichard explained, is that once the vessel is implanted, the patient's own cells will gradually populate it, making it similar to the body's native blood vessels.</p><p>Based on the new findings, the concept may work.</p><p>Researchers have been able to analyze tissue from the 13 patients who took part in the early study of the implants. They found that the patients' own cells and tiny blood vessels had migrated to the engineered vessels.</p><p>\"The patient's cells can repopulate it and make it living tissue,\" Prichard said.</p><p>Because the vessels do not contain foreign cells, she said, a patient's immune system shouldn't reject them. There were no signs of an immune response in the tissue from the 13 patients.</p><p>But much more research remains: The company is now running two later-stage trials, comparing the engineered vessels with standard approaches in kidney dialysis patients.</p><p>As it stands, there is no evidence the vessels work any better than the \"well-established materials in clinical use,\" said Dr. Frank LoGerfo, a professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School in Boston. He was not involved in the study.</p><p>It's also unclear whether the structures can form an \"endothelialized\" lining that helps them fully function like blood vessels, LoGerfo said. Nor is it clear how durable they will be under \"full arterial pressure\" from blood flow, he added.</p><p>The ultimate hope, according to Prichard, is to be able to create large numbers of engineered blood vessels that doctors can essentially obtain \"off-the-shelf\" for use in patients with various vascular illnesses, including heart disease.</p><p>That's different from the labor-intensive process of custom-engineering a blood vessel from a patient's own stem cells.</p><p>Another vascular surgeon who was not involved in the study called the progress being made toward bioengineered vessels \"exciting.\"</p><p>\"Having a vessel that handles and acts like real tissue is the 'holy grail,'\" said Dr. Stephen Hohmann, of Baylor Scott &amp; White Heart and Vascular Hospital in Dallas.</p><p>\"If you could have a tube, of any size, that acts like a blood vessel -- and have it available off-the-shelf -- that would open up a whole world,\" Hohmann said.</p><p>He stressed, though, that \"there is still a way to go before that happens.\"</p><p>The more immediate question, Hohmann said, is whether these engineered vessels can perform any better than existing approaches for dialysis patients.</p><p>In addition to the dialysis trials, Prichard said her company has begun two other studies.</p><p> One is focusing on patients with peripheral artery disease, a condition in which narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to the limbs. The other is on patients with traumatic blood vessel injuries that require surgery.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering has more on <a href=\"https://www.nibib.nih.gov/science-education/science-topics/tissue-engineering-and-regenerative-medicine\" target=\"_new\">bioengineered tissue</a>.</p>",

But they said the findings support the notion that the method of feeding matters, too.</p><p>Many women, particularly in the United States, have to pump breast milk when they return to work, noted lead researcher Meghan Azad, an assistant professor of pediatrics and child health at the University of Manitoba in Canada.</p><p>\"The message here is not that pumping is 'bad' or 'wrong,' \" she said. \"It's better than formula-feeding.\"</p><p>However, Azad explained, there are reasons why feeding at the breast might promote the healthiest rate of weight gain.</p><p>For one, she said, breast milk contains a range of \"interesting enzymes and hormones.\" And it's possible that their activity is depleted when pumped milk is refrigerated.</p><p>In addition, Azad said, it's thought that babies learn to \"self-regulate\" food intake when they nurse at mom's breast. In contrast, when parents bottle-feed, they often take charge -- encouraging their baby to finish the bottle.</p><p>Dr. Joan Meek is chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics section on breastfeeding. She said the AAP recommends exclusive breastfeeding for about six months. Once the baby starts on solid foods, Meek said, breastfeeding can continue \"for as long mother and child desire.\"</p><p>She agreed that there are reasons direct breastfeeding is ideal -- and the new findings support that. But practically speaking, Meek added, many women have to pump.</p><p>\"The lack of paid maternity leave policies in the U.S. can be a barrier for mothers who work outside the home,\" Meek said. \"Certainly for those mothers, their [pumped] breast milk is still the next best thing to direct breastfeeding.\"</p> <p>The findings, published online Sept. 24 in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i>, are based on more than 2,500 mother-infant pairs.</p><p>On average, the study found, babies who were still exclusively breastfed at 6 months had the healthiest weight by the age of 12 months. By comparison, babies who were no longer exclusively breastfed at 6 months had a threefold greater risk of being overweight by their first birthday.</p><p>However, when the researchers looked at moms' feeding methods, they found that babies given pumped breast milk tended to weigh a little more than those who fed from the breast.</p><p>It all suggests that direct breastfeeding is better for a \"healthy weight trajectory,\" said Dr. Alison Holmes, a pediatrician at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Hanover, N.H.</p><p>Like Meek, Holmes acknowledged the practical barriers. So she recommended that any time working moms are with their baby, they opt for the direct route rather than the bottle.</p><p>Holmes also pointed to a side benefit: \"There's less time spent washing dishes.\"</p><p>The study also looked at the effects of solid food introduction on babies' weight. In general, it found, when babies started on solids before the age of 5 months, their weight gain was on the rapid side.</p><p>But there was no sign that introducing solids at 5 months, rather than 6 months, spurred especially quick weight gain.</p><p>\"So introducing solids at that age may be OK, if that's what your baby wants,\" Azad said.</p><p>When it comes to starting solids, Holmes said, there seems to be a window that's best for babies' overall health.</p><p>\"Introducing solid foods sometime after the 5-month mark, but before the 7-month mark is healthiest in terms of balancing the benefits of healthy weight gain, allergy prevention and infectious disease prevention,\" she said.</p><p>To Azad, the findings have implications not just for parents, but for policies on paid maternity leave.</p><p>\"This is saying, you can't just give moms a breast pump and think you've solved the problem,\" Azad said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The AAP has more on <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/Breastfeeding/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_new\">breastfeeding</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY,  Sept. 20, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Puppies can be cute and cuddly, but they also carry germs that might make you very sick, a new government report warns. </p><p>An outbreak of antibiotic-resistant <i>Campylobacter</i> infections in 2017 and 2018 that sickened 118 people in 18 states was traced to pet store puppies, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>\"This is most likely the tip of the iceberg,\" said researcher Dr. Mark Laughlin, a CDC veterinarian science officer.</p><p>Among those sickened by the bacteria, 26 were hospitalized. Of those who became ill, 29 were pet store employees. It's likely that many others got sick, but not sick enough to go to the doctor, or doctors didn't report cases, Laughlin added.</p><p><i>Campylobacter</i> is not a rare bacteria. In fact, according to the CDC, it causes 1.3 million diarrheal illnesses in the United States each year. </p><p>\"People most often get <i>Campylobacter</i> after they consume undercooked chicken,\" Laughlin said. They can also get it from contaminated water and raw milk. </p><p>But it's rare that an outbreak of <i>Campylobacter</i> occurs,  \"and it's rare that it's associated with contact with pets,\" Laughlin said. </p><p>This outbreak was also unique because the bacteria was resistant to the antibiotics usually used to treat it, he explained.</p><p>According to Dr. Marc Siegel,  a professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, most people who are sickened with <i>Campylobacter</i> aren't treated with antibiotics.</p><p> The reason antibiotics aren't usually used is because they kill the bacteria but release the toxins the bacteria carries, and it's the toxins that cause most of the symptoms, Siegel said.</p><p>Usually, people get better without treatment, he noted.  \"One of the most common symptoms is bloody diarrhea,\" Siegel said.  Other symptoms include headache, muscle ache and fever. The illness usually lasts about a week and then goes away. </p><p> <i>Campylobacter</i>  is usually spread from feces, he said. It's common among chickens because of the way they're raised -- all crammed together. </p><p>It's possible that the same thing happens among puppies from puppy mills and pet stores, where the animals are in close contact with each other, Siegel suggested.</p><p>According to Laughlin, the outbreak was limited to dogs from pet stores. \"These dogs are raised in close quarters with lots of opportunity for them to mix and co-mingle,  so there's lots of opportunity for germs to spread among these dogs,\" he added.</p><p> Siegel said that because people get it from coming into contact with feces, or other places where the bacteria live, and then touching their mouth, transmitting the infection from one person to another does not usually occur. </p><p>He explained that  your dog can be infected with <i>Campylobacter</i> and not be sick, but it may still carry the germ. </p><p>Laughlin suggested that the best way to prevent getting sick after petting or playing with a dog is to wash your hands with soap and water. That's especially important after picking up dog poop, he added.</p><p>Because young children, older adults and people with weak immune systems can become seriously ill from <i>Campylobacter</i>, hand washing is particularly important, Laughlin stressed.</p><p>Siegel said that not every dog carries <i>Campylobacter</i>. \"But this is a reminder to people that your pet can have a bacteria that can get you sick,\" he added.</p> <p>The report was published Sept. 21 in the CDC's <i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on <i>Campylobacter</i>, visit the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/index.html\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

Because many smaller studies had not produced much evidence of any benefit in adding fish oil supplements to statin use, the hopes of heart experts were not high.</p><p>But the new trial, to be presented in November at the American Heart Association's annual meeting,  showed that these patients saw a 25 percent drop in their relative risk of heart attacks, strokes and other cardiac events compared to a control group of patients who received a placebo.</p><p>\"I'm very surprised by the magnitude of the results, which quite frankly are large. My expectations were very low. A lot of people are legitimately surprised by this,\" Dr. Michael Blaha, director of clinical research at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins Medical School, told the <i>Times</i>.</p><p>\"Fish oil has long been a popular supplement to protect against heart disease. It contains high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, primarily EPA and DHA, which reduce inflammation and lower triglyceride levels,\" explained Blaha, who was not involved in the trial. \"Omega-3 fatty acids also have blood-thinning effects similar to those of aspirin.\"</p><p>The new trial differed from previous studies in two aspects, the newspaper reported. First, it focused on a specific group of high-risk patients: People with a history of heart disease, diabetes or heart risk factors. In addition, all of the patients were on statins, which lower cholesterol.</p><p>Secondly, Vascepa was not the typical fish oil supplement that can be bought in any drugstore or supermarket. Manufactured by Amarin, Vascepa is a prescription drug that contains highly purified EPA, according to the <i>Times</i>.</p><p>Fish oil supplements often contain a mixture of both EPA and DHA and, in some cases, other oils. Both EPA and DHA can lower triglycerides, but DHA also tends to raise \"bad\"  LDL cholesterol, the newspaper said.</p><p>In the trial, more than 8,000 patients were followed for about five years, during which the drug was well tolerated and safe, the researchers noted.</p> <p>Dr. Ethan Weiss, a cardiologist and associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco, told the <i>Times</i> that the findings carried a few caveats. All of the data remains to be seen, and the group of patients most likely to see a benefit is very specific, added Weiss, who was not involved in the study.</p><p>Vascepa is now only approved for certain patients who have very high triglyceride levels, the newspaper said.</p><p>\"The worried well shouldn't run out and take fish oil,\" said Dr. Michael Shapiro, a site investigator for the trial and director of Oregon Health and Science University's Atherosclerosis Imaging Program.</p><p>But, \"the amount of people around the world who have atherosclerotic disease or diabetes who take a statin and still have elevated triglycerides is enormous,\" he said. \"This has huge implications.\"</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Critics Demand Stop to 'Guinea Pig' Sepsis Clinical Trial </b></span></p><p>A major nonprofit advocacy group is asking that a large government trial into the common and dangerous blood infection sepsis be shut down.</p><p>The trial, called Clovers, \"places seriously ill patients at risk without the possibility of gaining information that can provide benefits either to the subjects or to future patients,\" according to an analysis of the trial by investigators at the U.S. National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Md.</p><p>And in a letter sent to the federal Office for Human Research Protection, advocacy group Public Citizen compared the study to \"an experiment that would be conducted on laboratory animals,\" <i>The New York Times</i> reported.</p><p>\"The human subjects of the Clovers trial, as designed and currently conducted, are unwitting guinea pigs in a physiology experiment,\" Public Citizens' Dr. Michael Carome and Dr. Sidney Wolfe wrote in their letter.</p><p>The Clovers trial began in March and is funded by the NIH. It is moving forward and hopes to enroll 2,320 patients from 44 hospitals nationwide.</p><p>The scientists behind the study say it seeks to ascertain the best approach to treating sepsis, a major killer. According to the <i>Times</i>, at least 1 million Americans contract the condition annually, and 30 percent of them will die.</p><p>Sepsis occurs when the body's immune system mounts a massive attack against an infection, triggering inflammation throughout the body. Sepsis is typically first treated with antibiotics, but the condition can progress and cause lethal blood clots or organ failure.</p><p>The Clovers trial seeks to determine which one of two therapeutic options -- limiting fluids and using drugs that narrow blood vessels, or adding IV fluids and holding off on drug therapy  -- works best to curb sepsis. </p><p>But critics claim participants enrolled in Clovers could end up being given substandard care, endangering their lives.</p><p>For example, patients might see delays in the time it takes to receive fluids, and since sepsis progresses rapidly (often within 24 hours), such delays could prove fatal, Public Citizen says.</p><p>But the scientists behind Clover say those fears are unfounded, and that because sepsis care varies widely, in essence every Clover participant will still receive \"usual care.\"</p><p>Individual participants will also be allowed to deviate from study protocols if deemed necessary to preserve their health, added Dr. Nathan Shapiro, a professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School and co-chairman of the protocol committee for the study.</p><p>\"If the physician at the bedside thinks the patient needs a specific treatment, they will get it,\" Shapiro told the <i>Times</i>.</p><p>One expert not connected to the study believes more insight into proper sepsis care is needed.</p><p>\"There is not a lot of data about how much fluid to give, how much is enough, how much is too much, how much is too little,\" said Dr. Tiffany Osborn, an emergency physician and critical care specialist who spoke to the <i>Times</i>  on behalf of the College of Emergency Medical Physicians. \"That information is hard to get a handle on.\"</p><p>But Public Citizen's Carome believes that Clovers' methodology is simply too dangerous for participants.  Speaking to the <i>Times</i>, he said, \"We think Clovers can't be fixed.\"</p>",

We have H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A strains, and two influenza B strains have been detected.\"</p><p>Flu seasons aren't predictable, which is why you shouldn't skip your annual flu shot, added another infectious-disease expert, Dr. Lisa Maragakis. </p><p>The mild flu season in the Southern Hemisphere, which is just winding down, provides clues to what this year's flu season might look like, explained Maragakis, senior director of infection prevention at Johns Hopkins Health System in Baltimore. </p><p>\"It's cautiously good news that it might be a milder season than we saw last year -- so fingers crossed,\" said Maragakis. </p><p>Still, even when activity overall is low, people still get influenza, Brammer said. \"And influenza can have really tragic consequences. Even people that are healthy and young can get influenza and it can, in rare cases, lead to death,\" she added.</p><p>Last year, 80,000 people in the United States died from flu -- a record high, Brammer said. The deaths included 183 children, most of whom were unvaccinated.</p><p>Because last year's vaccine wasn't a good match to the predominant H3N2 virus, the vaccine has been tweaked, Brammer said. </p><p>This year's four-strain vaccine includes H1N1 and H3N2 plus the two influenza B strains. The three-strain vaccine has just one B strain, Brammer said. </p><b>Who is most at risk?</b><p>It's critical that mothers of children under 6 months get vaccinated, because their babies can't, Brammer said. </p><p>Others at highest risk for flu complications, particularly pneumonia, are young children, older people and those with chronic medical conditions, she said.</p><p>Getting vaccinated protects others. It's the best way to safeguard yourself, your loved ones and coworkers, Brammer said.</p><p>But myths still persist.</p><p>A recent survey by Orlando Health Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Florida found that a third of parents with children under 18 think the shot won't work. And more than half believe you can get the flu from the vaccine.</p><p>Both beliefs are wrong, Brammer said. Vaccination is the best protection regardless of age.</p><p>You can't get the flu from a flu shot because the viruses in the vaccine are dead, she said. They trigger your immune system to make antibodies against the flu, but can't give you influenza. </p><p>Although the nasal spray vaccine uses a live virus, it has been altered so you can't get flu from it, Brammer said. However, this vaccine is not for everyone, and you should check with your doctor first.</p><p>October is the best time to get vaccinated, because it takes 10 days to two weeks for the vaccine to become fully effective. You'll be protected by the time flu season is in full swing, Maragakis said.</p><p>What else can you do to boost protection?</p><p>Wash your hands often, cover your coughs and sneezes, and avoid getting close to someone who is ill, Maragakis said. </p><p>If the flu does strike, your doctor can prescribe antiviral drugs that will shorten the time you're sick, she said. These medicines work best if taken when symptoms start. </p><p>In addition, stay out of work, so you don't infect others, Brammer said. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on flu, visit the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/index.html\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Sept. 18, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Levels of anxiety and depression seen in people who have a common heart rhythm disorder called atrial fibrillation may be affected by how the heart condition is treated, a new study suggests.</p> <p>Past studies have shown that anxiety, distress and depression are common among people with AFib. The new Australian study, published Tuesday in the <i>Journal of the American Heart Association</i>, looked at personality traits and levels of anxiety and depression in 78 patients who had sought treatment for the disorder. Twenty chose to have an ablation, a procedure that destroys the heart tissue causing the abnormal heartbeat; the other 58 were on medications to control their heart rate and prevent blood clots.</p> <p>When the study began, 35 percent of the participants reported experiencing severe anxiety and distress and 20 percent reported having had suicidal thoughts. One year later, the researchers found that the patients who had an ablation were less likely to report feelings of anxiety and depression than the patients taking medications. In addition, the number of patients in the ablation group with suicidal thoughts dropped from six to one.</p> <p>The study's senior author, Jonathan Kalman, an electrophysiologist at the Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia, said the study \"demonstrates that effective treatment of atrial fibrillation markedly reduces psychological distress.\"</p>    <p>In addition, Kalman said the findings \"implicate atrial fibrillation as the cause\" of the anxiety and depression. \"This psychological impact is not well appreciated by many heart specialists and is important to take into consideration when considering\" how patients are treated, he added.</p> <p>The study also found higher levels of anxiety and distress among patients found to have a Type D personality, which is characterized by anger and pessimism. Previous studies have linked this personality type to poor health outcomes and lower quality of life in patients treated for AFib.</p> <p>Of the 78 patients in the study, 35 were identified as having this type of personality on the distressed personality scale. The researchers suggest that identifying patients with this personality type could help health care providers focus attention on those most at risk for experiencing anxiety, distress or suicidal thoughts.</p> <p>At least 2.7 million Americans are living with AFib, an abnormal heartbeat that affects blood flow and can lead to stroke, heart failure and other heart complications.</p> <p>Dr. Dimpi Patel is an internist and researcher at Wilmington Health at New Hanover Regional Medical Center in North Carolina who studies the mind-heart link. \"Patients need to be aware that physical ailments can and do have psychological manifestations, and both must be acknowledged and managed to ensure a good quality of life and perhaps even prevent worse outcomes,\" she said.</p> <p>Patel, who was not involved in the study, said the study's small size limited what could be construed from the findings. She said that she would like to see studies that look at the impact of different types of psychological therapies on patients with AFib as well as studies that focus on how women with the condition are affected by psychological distress.</p> <p>Many physical health problems can affect someone's mental health. \"It is important to note that psychological distress, depression, anxiety and, at times, suicidal ideation are not exclusive to atrial fibrillation, but to many chronic diseases such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure,\" Patel said.</p> <p>\"Physicians have an obligation to broaden their approach in managing any chronic illness to include emphasis on the psychological well-being of their patient,\" she added. \"To me, it is simply practicing good and compassionate medicine.\"</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Sept. 18, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The very air you breathe may make you vulnerable to developing dementia, a new study suggests.</p><p>British researchers found that people exposed to higher levels of air pollution had 40 percent higher odds of developing dementia.</p><p>\"We found that older patients across greater London who were living in areas with higher air pollution were more likely to be diagnosed with dementia in subsequent years,\" said study author Iain Carey. He's a senior lecturer in epidemiology at the University of London.</p><p>Carey said the increased risk persisted even after his team accounted for other factors that might increase dementia, such as smoking and diabetes. </p><p>However, the researchers aren't suggesting that people need to abandon cities. </p><p>\"Since this is an observational study, any findings need to be treated with caution. It only tells us there may be a possible link between air pollution and dementia, and more research is needed to confirm and understand this,\" Carey said. </p><p>Dementia is a catch-all term for a number of brain disorders that cause trouble with memory and thinking. The most common form of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, according to the U.S.-based Alzheimer's Association.</p><p>The second most common form of dementia is called vascular dementia. This occurs when the brain is deprived of blood flow and oxygen due to other conditions, such as a stroke or a number of small strokes, the Alzheimer's Association explained.</p><p>The study focused on people who were eventually diagnosed with these two forms of dementia. </p><p>The researchers began by reviewing the records of nearly 131,000 adults registered with 75 general physician practices in the London area. Carey said all of the locations were in urban areas. </p><p>At the start of the study, all of the participants were between the ages of 50 and 79. None had been diagnosed with dementia.</p><p>The researchers then estimated each person's annual exposure to air pollution, such as nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter and ozone. They also estimated the participants' proximity to heavy traffic.</p><p>After an average follow-up of seven years, almost 2,200 people -- or nearly 2 percent of the total group -- had been diagnosed with dementia. </p><p>Those living in the areas with the highest levels of nitrogen dioxide compared to those living with the lowest exposure had a 40 percent increased risk of developing dementia, the study found. The odds of an Alzheimer's disease diagnosis was 50 percent higher for people living with the highest exposure to nitrogen dioxide. </p><p>Similar increases in risk were also seen for high levels of particulate matter. For other measures, such as ozone and distance to heavy traffic, the researchers said there was less evidence of any links.</p><p>Carey said it's not clear why air pollution appears to be linked to dementia. He noted that other research has suggested that children's brain development may be affected by pollution.</p><p>Heather Snyder, senior director of medical and scientific operations for the Alzheimer's Association, said this study \"raises a lot of interesting questions.\" But she also said it's too soon to speculate how pollution might play a role in dementia.</p><p>\"Dementia is complex and there are lots of things that may contribute to dementia risk. I don't think you can draw any conclusions from this study,\" Snyder said.</p><p>Dr. Bruce Silverman, a neurologist at Ascension Providence Hospital in Southfield, Mich., also thought it was too early to make any recommendations based on this study. He also noted that dementia occurs in people living all over -- in urban, suburban and rural areas. </p><p>But he said if you start looking at factors that might cause premature death of nerve cells in the brain, \"living in an environment that is toxic to those cells from pollution is probably not healthy.\" </p><p>Both Snyder and Silverman recommended that if people are concerned about dementia, there are steps they can take to help prevent the disorder, or to potentially help slow the progress of dementia if you already have it. </p><p>Steps that both experts recommended included getting regular exercise, eating a healthy diet low in saturated fat with plenty of vegetables and fruits, getting adequate sleep, and keeping your brain engaged with things like puzzles, new learning and social activities. </p><p>The study was published Sept. 18 in the <i>BMJ</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about keeping your brain healthy from the <a href=\"https://www.alz.org/help-support/brain_health/10_ways_to_love_your_brain\" target=\"_new\">Alzheimer's Association</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Sept. 25, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- More people are stepping in to help give CPR when someone's heart stops, and first responders are intervening at higher levels -- but survival rates are higher for men who have cardiac arrests than for women, a recent study suggests.</p> <p>Based on data for 8,100 people in 16 North Carolina counties from 2010 to 2014, researchers measured the impact of a state initiative to improve care for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients. The Duke University-led study was inspired by the Institute of Medicine's 2015 call for action for better care of patients whose hearts stop outside of a hospital.</p> <p>Despite \"tremendous improvement\" in CPR and first responder defibrillation, \"we did not see improvement in survival for women, which is disappointing,\" said Dr. Carolina Malta Hansen, a researcher at Duke Clinical Research Institute.</p> <p>\"This improvement only seems to be substantial for a small group of patients -- usually younger and male patients -- who have a cardiac arrest in a public place,\" said Hansen, who led the study, published in the <i>Journal of the American Heart Association</i>.</p> <p>Different than a heart attack, cardiac arrest is an often-fatal event caused by the sudden loss of heart function in someone who may or may not be diagnosed with heart disease. More than 350,000 cardiac arrests happen outside of U.S. hospitals each year, with about 90 percent of those people dying.</p> <p>CPR -- or cardiopulmonary resuscitation -- can double or triple a person's chance of survival. In 2014, about 45 percent of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims survived when bystander CPR was given.</p> <p>But only about 46 percent of those who suffered cardiac arrests outside of a hospital in 2017 received bystander CPR.</p> <p>Hansen said a number of factors might explain why women had worse outcomes. Compared to male victims of cardiac arrests, women are more likely to have cardiomyopathy, or disease of the heart muscle, and non-shockable rhythms that can't be treated with defibrillation. Women who suffer cardiac arrests also tend to be older than men and live at home alone, with less chance of CPR being performed.</p> <p>\"Those are all characteristics that we know are associated with poorer survival,\" she said.</p> <p>\"This study has complex findings that, in many ways, raises more questions than it answers,\" said Dr. Benjamin Abella, director of the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Resuscitation Science and a professor of emergency medicine. \"But the most important message is that CPR works: The more people who deliver CPR, the more survivors you have who can leave the hospital and return to their families. That's the good news.\"</p> <p>Abella, who was not involved in the study, said the results underscore the need for more research on ways to improve bystander CPR and increase the use of automated external defibrillators in public places. He said some bystanders might be hindered by the idea of removing clothing or touching the breasts of a woman to perform CPR or use an automated external defibrillator (AED).</p> <p>\"We need to have a better understanding of people's psychology when they're faced with emergency situations, so we can address it through education or training,\" he said. \"We need to go deeper and understand the barriers: Is it fear of being sued? Is there some other emotional barrier?\"</p> <p>Training might be improved by using female manikins with breasts, or by using virtual reality simulations, Abella said. \"The advantage of virtual reality is you can make it very lifelike and get a truer sense of somebody's response.\"</p> <p>Hansen said there's still a great need to strengthen \"all the links in the chain of survival,\" including training 911 dispatchers, emergency workers, the public and hospital staff.</p> <p>\"But the most important thing for the general public to know is that bystander intervention is paramount,\" she said. \"You shouldn't be afraid of doing something wrong, because anything is better than nothing: Stepping in and starting CPR and applying an AED before EMS arrives is the foundation for survival.\"</p>",

Inflammation can lead to fluid buildup behind the eardrum. The eustachian tubes, which connect the middle ear to the back of the nose and throat, could become swollen.</p><p>Babies and children are more prone to these problems than adults because their still-developing immune systems have a harder time fighting off infections. And the size and position of ear passages make it easier for germs to reach the middle ear and for fluid to get trapped.</p><p>According to a 2016 study in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i>, breastfeeding and decreasing exposure to smoking help reduce ear infections. Also, try to protect baby from getting frequent colds -- 46 percent of infants had the common cold before their ear infection diagnosis.</p><p>Middle ear infections are the leading cause of doctor visits and prescriptions for antibiotics. But more doctors are now taking a wait-and-see approach for 2 to 3 days unless it's severe or baby is still an infant.</p><p>Many infections clear up on their own without antibiotics.

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Sept. 27, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Having a limb amputated can be traumatic, yet experts say not enough is being done to prevent a common disease that can lead to limb loss.</p> <p>Critical limb ischemia, or CLI, is a severe form of peripheral artery disease, a narrowing of the arteries of the extremities that typically affects the legs. At least 6.8 million Americans ages 40 and older have peripheral artery disease. Among them, more than 1 percent develop critical limb ischemia.</p> <p>Critical limb ischemia is caused by the same artery-clogging plaque that causes heart attacks and strokes, said Dr. Mark Creager, director of the Heart and Vascular Center at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire.</p> <p>\"CLI occurs when the blockages are so severe that the blood supply to the leg -- and particularly to the foot -- is inadequate to maintain its normal nutritional needs. A patient's skin might break down and progress to ulcers and gangrene, and they may end up losing their leg,\" said Creager, a professor of medicine at Dartmouth.</p> <p>Estimates vary on how many people with CLI go on to have amputations, with one study reporting that without treatment, up to 40 percent of patients have an amputation within one year. Symptoms of CLI include leg and foot pain, infections, and cracks and sores that don't heal.</p> <p>\"Look at your feet. The presence of painful fissures, particularly between the toes, nonhealing ulcers, and blackened toes could each be an indication of CLI,\" Creager said.</p> <p>\"Another sign of CLI is persistent pain in the feet, oftentimes when the patient is lying in bed, which may improve with standing. We have more blood supply to the foot when we're standing because of the effects of gravity. If you have more pain in your feet when you put your legs up, that's a worrisome symptom,\" he said.</p> <p>Spotting symptoms early and getting to the doctor quickly is essential, said Dr. Marie Gerhard-Herman, a physician and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.</p> <p>\"Early recognition is huge, because if you can increase blood flow to their foot or leg before the muscle starts dying, then you can actually bring the foot or the leg back to life,\" said Gerhard-Herman, who chaired the group that wrote the 2016 peripheral artery disease guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology.</p> <p>Patients with peripheral artery disease should be treated with cholesterol-lowering statins and blood-thinning medications to reduce the risk of heart attack and prevent CLI, Creager said. Once CLI occurs, patients should be considered for a revascularization procedure that restores blood flow and may involve stents or bypass surgery, he said.</p> <p>Two main risk factors for critical limb ischemia are smoking and diabetes, said Gerhard-Herman.</p> <p>\"We know that people who stop smoking have less peripheral artery disease, which means less CLI,\" she said. And because people with diabetes are more prone to infections, \"if they don't have enough blood delivered to the limb, they cannot fight the infection, and they lose the limb,\" she added, making better diabetes control extremely important.</p> <p>Other lifestyle factors that can help control peripheral artery disease and possibly prevent critical limb ischemia include eating a healthy diet, maintaining normal blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and getting regular exercise.</p> <p>But experts say there are still a lot of unanswered questions about how to best prevent and control critical limb ischemia.</p> <p>\"There's a terrific need for research to develop additional therapies for CLI &hellip; there's a long way to go,\" Creager said. \"We also have to enlighten the public about CLI so patients can take steps to get PAD identified earlier, get the appropriate treatment, and prevent the risk of progression of CLI and loss of limb.\"</p> <p>Eileen Bogosian can vouch for how traumatic the loss of a limb can be. A retired X-ray technician, singer and teacher, Bogosian, 84, developed peripheral artery disease and then critical limb ischemia after she was first diagnosed with a benign bone tumor and bone fractures on her right femur.</p> <p>After going through a series of stent surgeries, Bogosian had her right leg amputated above the knee in June.</p> <p>She said getting early treatment allowed her to keep her leg for several years longer than she otherwise would have, and she urged people to seek medical attention quickly, and reject any advice from friends who say otherwise.</p> <p>\"If you are suddenly noticing any questionable symptoms, don't wait. Waiting is going to possibly add damage to what you already have,\" said Bogosian of Seekonk, Massachusetts. \"I tell people -- especially elderly people -- to be your own advocate and get to a doctor. You need to catch it early and nip it in the bud so you can keep living a happy, healthy life.\"</p>",

U.S. Senators John McCain and Ted Kennedy both succumbed to this cancer.</p><p>In the new therapy, an international group of researchers used a harmless form of the Zika virus to target and destroy glioblastoma cells in mouse brains, while leaving healthy brain cells untouched.</p><p>The mosquito-borne Zika virus made headlines over the past few years because of its connection to severe brain defects in babies born to women infected in pregnancy.</p><p>But the virus might offer a new avenue for brain cancer care, according to a team led by Pei-Yong Shi, a virologist at University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, and virologist Cheng-Feng Qin of the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing.</p><p>They explained that Zika's ability to infect brain cells -- and cause devastating brain changes in the fetus -- could be used to target glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) in the brain as well. These stem cells are thought to be the source of tumor recurrence.</p><p>\"If we could find a way to specifically target those GSCs that are the source of recurrence, then that might provide an option to prevent recurrence or even a cure,\" Qin said in a news release from the American Society of Microbiology (ASM).</p><p>In their research, the team members first confirmed that Zika could attack glioblastoma stem cells, both in lab culture and in a mouse model. In fact, the virus was much more \"efficient\" at targeting the tumor cells compared to healthy brain neurons, they said.</p><p>Shi and Qin's group has already developed a candidate Zika virus vaccine, made from an inactivated, harmless form of the virus. This tweaked virus has a deletion from its genetic blueprint that makes it incapable of efficiently replicating, the researchers explained.</p><p>The scientists first confirmed that the vaccine was safe in mice. Next, they mixed the vaccine with a sample of glioblastoma stem cells, and injected that combo in the brains of mice. Other mice received an injection of the stem cells alone, without the tweaked Zika virus.</p><p>The result: While glioblastomas arose quickly in the brains of mice that didn't receive the vaccine, they developed much more slowly for mice that got the Zika vaccine as well.</p><p>And while the average survival time for mice without the vaccine was an average of 30 days, survival for those that had gotten the Zika vaccine was extended to 50 days.</p><p>Of course, this research is in an extremely early stage. But the hope is that glioblastoma patients might one day be given the Zika vaccine simultaneously with their surgery to \"let the viruses hunt down the GSCs and eliminate them,\" Qin said.</p><p>Brain cancer specialists cautioned that the research is promising but preliminary.</p><p>\"Many new therapies for glioblastoma have looked promising 'in vivo' [that is, in animal studies], only to fail later on,\" said Dr. Michael Schulder, who helps direct neurosurgery at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y.</p> <p>Still, he thinks the approach is \"ingenious.\"</p><p>\"The authors of this study cleverly used the very aspect of the Zika virus that has made it worrisome as a public health threat -- the tendency of the virus to replicate and damage brain cells, specifically the cells that are involved in brain development -- as a way to attack glioblastoma,\" Schulder said.</p><p>Dr. John Boockvar, vice chair of neurosurgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, agreed.</p><p>\"Like the authors in this study, we are looking for ways to trigger a strong immune response in patients with glioblastoma, which induces inflammation and eventually glioblastoma cell death,\" he said. \"Using a harmless form of the Zika virus to preferentially infect glioblastoma cells in order to illicit an immune response is a smart strategy to fight this devastating disease.\"</p><p>According to Shi, the next step is to collaborate with doctors to develop trials evaluating the approaches' safety in patients.</p><p>The study authors also hope to genetically tweak the Zika virus even more to make it a more effective killer of glioblastoma cells.</p><p>\"As a virologist, I see that we should take advantage of the 'bad' side of viruses,\" Shi said in the release. \"They should have a role to play in cancer treatment.\"</p><p>The findings were published Sept. 18 in the ASM journal <i>mBIO</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on glioblastomas, visit the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/brain-spinal-cord-tumors-adults/about/types-of-brain-tumors.html\" target=\"_new\"> American Cancer Society</a>.</p>",

The bottom line: The traditional beats the digital.</p><p>\"This report is addressing the substantial change there's been in toys over the past couple of decades -- and the substantial change in parents' perception of toys,\" said Dr. Alan Mendelsohn, one of the report authors.</p><p>That is, traditional playthings like dolls, cars, blocks and crayons have given way to the virtual -- from games played on mobile devices to talking animals that read stories out loud.</p><p>Often, digital-based toys are marketed as \"educational,\" and many parents view them that way, said Mendelsohn, an associate professor of pediatrics and population health at NYU Langone Health, in New York City.</p><p>However, he said, while a digital toy might help kids learn a \"limited\" skill, it's really unconditional playtime that children need.</p><p>\"Toys are simply props that can be used to help parents and children spend quality time together,\" Mendelsohn said. It's that human interaction, he stressed, that matters.</p><p>Simpler toys can give children more freedom to use their imagination and creativity, practice problem-solving, and learn how to interact with others -- by having to negotiate game \"rules,\" for example, according to the AAP.</p><p>Story time is also a big part of that, Mendelsohn noted. \"Young children learn the most through interaction with their caregivers, and that includes reading out loud together,\" he said.</p><p>In other words, don't let an electronic bear take over the storytelling duties.</p><p>\"This is not to say that screen time, in moderation, is harmful,\" Mendelsohn said. \"But those toys should not replace interactions with your children.\"</p><p>He noted that for babies, there's no need for screen time, with the exception of video \"chats\" with family. The AAP advises against any screen media for children younger than 18 months, and suggests only very limited use between 18 and 24 months -- always with a caregiver playing along.</p><p>For children aged 2 to 5, the AAP recommends that parents limit all screen time -- including TV, computers and mobile devices -- to no more than one hour per day.</p><p>At this point, the iPad has only been around for about a decade, noted Dr. Dimitri Christakis, director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children's Research Institute.</p><p>That means it's not yet clear what kinds of effects -- good and bad -- electronic devices and apps might have on young kids' development, he said.</p><p>But, Christakis said, researchers do know plenty about the importance of human interaction in young children's play.</p><p>\"The problem with these devices,\" he said, \"is that they're designed to command the user's attention. They're hard to share.\"</p><p>And it's not just \"screens\" that can be problematic, Christakis added,  but also any \"electronic gizmo, with lots of bells and whistles.\"</p><p>When it comes to fueling kids' imaginations and helping them build an array of essential skills, \"simple is best,\" he said.</p><p>Christakis pointed to a study he conducted among lower-income families with toddlers. Some of the families were randomly assigned to receive toy building blocks, along with suggestions on activities parents and kids could do with the blocks. The other families did not receive the blocks until after the study was over.</p><p>In the end, toddlers given the toy blocks at the outset showed greater gains in their language skills.</p><p>Why would building blocks affect language development? \"It wasn't the blocks,\" Christakis said. \"It was the interaction between parents and children.\"</p><p>So, the AAP suggests, when you head out holiday shopping, think traditional: books; art supplies; dolls and stuffed animals; old-fashioned card games, board games and puzzles; toy cars, planes and trains; balls and tricycles.</p><p>When children use toy characters and objects to pretend-play, Mendelsohn said, they learn how to socialize, regulate emotions and build other skills they need in real life.</p><p>He and Christakis made another point: Parents need to put down their own devices, too.</p><p>If your baby sees that phone constantly in your hand, Christakis said, she'll eventually want it.</p> <p>Plus, Mendelsohn noted, whatever time you spend mesmerized by your device is time you're not spending with your children.</p><p>The report was published online Dec. 3 in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For tips on children's playtime, visit <a href=\"https://www.zerotothree.org/early-learning/play\" target=\"_new\">ZeroToThree.org</a>.</p>",

This provides us with many new insights into how our bodies regulate blood pressure, and has revealed several new opportunities for future drug development,\" he said.</p><p>\"With this information, we could calculate a person's genetic risk score for high blood pressure in later life,\" Caulfield explained in a Queen Mary University news release. He is a professor and researcher at the university. </p><p>Doctors could then suggest lifestyle interventions, including weight loss, lower alcohol consumption and exercise, for those at genetic risk for high blood pressure, he added.</p><p>High blood pressure, which is a risk factor for stroke and heart disease, claimed almost 8 million lives around the world in 2015 alone, the researchers noted.</p><p>For the study, they examined the DNA of more than 1 million people and cross-referenced their genetic information with their blood pressure. </p><p>After comparing the people at highest risk for high blood pressure with those at lowest risk, the team calculated that all the genetic variants linked with the condition were associated with blood pressure that's roughly 13 mm Hg higher.</p><p>Among the newly identified blood pressure genes were variants already tied to other conditions, including the APOE gene linked to heart disease and Alzheimer's disease. The researchers noted some genes also played a role within the adrenal glands, and in body fat.</p><p>Study co-leader Paul Elliott, from Imperial College London, said, \"Identifying these kinds of genetic signals will increasingly help us to split patients into groups based on their risk of disease.\"</p><p>The findings also pointed to some possible new treatment approaches for high blood pressure. One of the newly found gene regions linked to high blood pressure is already targeted by the type 2 diabetes drug canagliflozin (Invokana, Sulisent).

Only when the appendix looks like it may burst immediately is an operation necessary. And the difference is easily seen on a CT scan, said lead researcher Dr. Paulina Salminen, a surgeon at Turku University Hospital.</p><p>\"There are no severe complications associated with the antibiotic therapy, so it's a safe option,\" she said.</p><p>About 20 to 30 percent of patients with appendicitis have a perforated appendix that needs to be removed, but 70 to 80 percent of patients may only need antibiotics, Salminen added.</p><p>A perforation is a small tear in the appendix, which lets its contents leak out into the stomach. This can cause a potentially fatal blood infection.</p><p>In a trial that compared 273 patients who had an appendectomy with 257 treated with antibiotics, researchers found that about 60 percent of those treated with antibiotics didn't need to have their appendix removed in the five years after treatment.</p><p>In all, 100 of 257 patients treated with antibiotics had to have an appendectomy over the five years of the study, including 15 patients operated on during the initial hospitalization, the researchers found.</p><p>The report was published Sept. 25 in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>. </p><p>One U.S. expert brought up the pros and cons of antibiotics instead of surgery. </p><p>\"I think the big issue is this -- can physicians and patients accept the fact that there could be close to a 40 percent chance of recurrence in five years?\" said Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>This might not be acceptable for many people, he said.</p><p>\"It's a question of how risk-averse you truly want to be, given that once your appendix is removed with uncomplicated appendicitis, your risk of complications is quite minimal,\" Glatter said.</p><p>Patients need to understand that while antibiotics may effectively treat acute appendicitis 60 to 70 percent of the time, the treatment may also fail and require an operation, he said.</p><p>Although the antibiotics-only approach has been gaining increased attention and popularity, it requires further study in specific subgroups of patients who may be at higher risk, including patients with appendicolith, in which the appendix is obstructed with calcified deposits. These patients were excluded from this latest study, Glatter noted.</p><p>In addition, the study only looked at open appendectomy, not the less invasive laparoscopic appendectomy. The laparoscopic approach is associated with a shorter hospital stay and a lower risk of complications than open surgery, Glatter explained.</p><p>Antibiotic therapy required three days of intravenous antibiotics given in the hospital, plus seven days of oral antibiotics. The hospital stay after laparoscopic surgery was only one day, he noted.</p><p>\"The decision to initiate antibiotics-only as opposed to pursuing an operative approach to treating acute appendicitis should incorporate shared decision-making between physicians, patients and their families,\" Glatter said.</p><p>In fact, a recent survey from the University of North Dakota School of Medicine found that even though appendicitis often resolves with the use of antibiotics, the overwhelming majority of Americans would choose surgery instead. Only about 1 in every 10 adults said they'd use antibiotics to ease an inflamed appendix, according to survey results. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/appendicitis\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</a> for more on appendicitis.</p>",

It's the date that mandatory nutrition and calorie information took effect for most chain restaurants, enabling consumers to compare menu items before ordering and, hopefully, make smarter choices.</p><p>Some cities across the country had already required restaurants to post calorie counts so that diners know how many they're actually eating. But it turns out that many people ignore this valuable information.</p><p>One study done at fast food restaurants in New York found no change in the average number of calories people ordered in the six years following the start of menu labeling there. And the number of diners aware of the high calorie count of most fast foods actually dropped from 51 to 37 percent over the same period. Surprisingly, the researchers also found few differences between the number of calories in meals eaten at restaurants where labeling was mandatory and at other food establishments where it was not.</p><p>On the other hand, a separate study done in Phoenix found that even though the number of people who use labeling information was small -- just 16 percent -- it did result in their making choices that saved them nearly 150 calories.</p><p>Why should <i>you</i> pay attention to this information? About one-third of adult Americans are obese, a number that's expected to rise to 42 percent by 2030. So, many of us need to eat fewer calories. We also need to eat less saturated fat, a primary source of calories (think: cheesy dishes).</p><p>On a more positive note, some restaurant chains that made the decision to voluntarily label foods early on also lowered the calorie count on many offerings by nearly 140. So, labeling may be a catalyst for restaurants to offer low-calorie choices in addition to their regular selections, making it easier for you to eat healthful meals.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Find out more about nutrition labeling in restaurants at the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm515020.htm\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> website.</p>",

He is clinical chair of medicine at the University of Aberdeen School of Medicine in Scotland.</p><p>Although the Mediterranean diet is considered healthy, this study could not prove that the diet itself caused stroke risk to drop. </p><p>In addition, why men's risk for stroke isn't also lowered isn't yet clear, Myint said.</p><p>But, \"it is widely acknowledged that men and women are very different with regard to normal physiology,\" he added.</p><p>Women have unique stroke risk factors that include using oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy. And during pregnancy, having preeclampsia and gestational diabetes are considered risk factors for stroke, Myint pointed out.</p><p>\"It may be that certain components in the Mediterranean diet may influence risk of stroke in women more than in men,\" he said.</p><p>For the study, the investigators collected data on more than 23,000 men and women, aged 40 to 77, who took part in a large cancer study. The participants were followed for 17 years.</p><p> The researchers found that, overall, those who followed a Mediterranean diet cut their risk for stroke 17 percent. When looking at men and women separately, however, women saw a reduction in risk of 22 percent, while men saw a 6 percent drop in risk. The risk reduction among men, however, might be so small that it is a \"chance\" finding, the scientists added. </p><p>Moreover, among those with a high risk for stroke, the risk was lowered 13 percent for those who followed a Mediterranean diet, the findings showed. This association, however, was mainly due to a 20 percent reduction in risk among women, the researchers found.</p><p>The findings were published online Sept. 20 in the journal <i>Stroke</i>.</p><p>According to Samantha Heller, a senior clinical nutritionist at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, \"The Mediterranean eating style, which has great variations among several different cultures, is characterized by foods high in anti-inflammatory compounds, including fiber, vitamins, minerals and healthy plant compounds.\" </p><p>Previous research has suggested that the Mediterranean diet reduces the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, obesity and declines in thinking skills, she said.</p><p>Foods such as olive oil, zucchini, lemons, hummus, tabouleh, pasta, eggplant, lentils, tomatoes, artichokes, salads and spices are staples in many parts of the Mediterranean, Heller explained.</p><p>\"In contrast, the typical Western diet is high in foods that increase inflammation, such as burgers, hot dogs, steak, butter, sodium, sugary beverages, fried foods, fast and junk foods, all of which have been associated with increased risks of chronic diseases,\" she said.</p><p>Heller suggests skipping the ham and cheese on white bread with mayo for lunch, and instead trying hummus on whole wheat pita with cucumbers and tomatoes. For dinner, try going meatless a few nights a week with a pasta primavera, roasted vegetables, Greek salad, quinoa and lentil-stuffed lettuce wraps, she added.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart  Association  has more about the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/mediterranean-diet\" target=\"_new\"> Mediterranean diet</a>.</p>",

This fact should give people who have guns second thoughts about how guns are stored and if they should keep firearms at all, she added.</p><p>To find out how people think about gun deaths, Morgan and her colleagues used data from the 2015 National Firearms Survey of nearly 4,000 U.S. adults who were asked to rank causes of violent death over the past year. The researchers compared those responses with official state death counts.</p><p>The investigators found that although suicide was more common than homicide in all the states, most people thought the opposite.</p><p>\"The inconsistency between the true causes and what the public perceives to be frequent causes of death indicates a gap in knowledge, and a place where additional education can be helpful,\" Morgan said in a university news release. </p><p>When people think murder is the top risk, they might buy a gun to protect themselves. Without understanding the high risk of suicide, they might not store it safely, the researchers added.</p><p>The real nature of the risk of gun deaths needs to be promoted by the media and the entertainment industry, Morgan said.</p><p>\"By having mass media and other communication mechanisms enable further discussions of suicide, we, as a society, can have a more informed conversation about suicide prevention,\" she explained.</p><p>The study authors want to learn more about how people form their opinions on gun violence so they can find ways to change these perceptions.</p><p>\"We know that this is a mixture of mass and individual communication, but what really leads people to draw the conclusions that they do?

That risk starts to drop off by the time people reach young adulthood and middle age. But when people reach their 70s, their risk goes up again, with 1 in every 10 seniors affected.</p> <p>\"Eczema -- also known as atopic dermatitis -- is an itchy inflammatory skin disease,\" explained study author Dr. Katrina Abuabara, an assistant professor in the department of dermatology at the University of California, San Francisco.</p><p>\"Because eczema often develops early in life and waxes and wanes over time, most research has focused on children,\" Abuabara said.</p><p>\"Ours is the first large study to examine rates of active physician-diagnosed disease across the entire life span,\" she said. \"Similar to other reports, we found declining rates of active disease across childhood. We were surprised, however, to find steady rates of active disease throughout adulthood and increasing rates in older age.\"</p><p>To explore how eczema risk plays out over one's lifetime, Abuabara and the research team analyzed statistics regarding eczema cases on British residents between 1994 and 2013.</p><p>In all, the data concerned more than 8.6 million patients, ranging from infancy up to age 99.</p><p>Ultimately, the team found that individuals appear to face a 1 in 10 chance for developing eczema at some point in their lives.</p><p>But risk did vary across age groups. In fact, Abuabara noted, the risk follows a \"U\" shape: \"It is highest in childhood, dips among young adults, and rises in mid-to-late adulthood,\" she said.</p><p>Specifically, the researchers found that a near 20 percent risk among very young children starts to decline steadily during the preteen years, ultimately hitting a low of about 5 percent by the time people reach age  20.</p><p>Thereafter risk hovers steadily at that level, only to start a slow ascent again when individuals hit their late 50s.</p><p>The findings were published in the Dec. 3 issue of the <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p>As for treatment, Abuabara said the gold standard involves moisturizers, topical corticosteroids, phototherapy and immunotherapy drugs, as needed.</p><p>She also noted that \"the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved two new medications for eczema in 2016 and 2017, and more than a dozen additional agents are under development and clinical testing, offering hope for more personalized and targeted treatments.\"</p><p>Dr. Robert Kirsner, chairman of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine's department of dermatology and cutaneous surgery, characterized current treatment options as \"limited.\" He was not involved with the study.</p><p>\"Cost is an issue, and potential side effects of oral medications may also be an issue,\" Kirsner said. And only one injectable drug has been approved by the FDA, so insurance companies do not always agree to pay for medications, he said.</p><p>However, he noted that \"new medications are being developed, which will likely add tools to help alleviate patient suffering.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the study \"confirms other recent data suggesting that common eczema persists into adulthood,\" Kirsner said.</p><p>\"The fact that eczema is less common in young adults and middle-aged [people] suggests that either childhood eczema wanes over time and recurs, or that it wanes and new cases develop in late adulthood,\" he said.</p><p>Regardless, Kirsner noted that \"for a long time it was the thought that the majority of childhood cases of eczema resolve, but this is clearly not the case.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S.-based nonprofit National Eczema Association has more on  <a href=\"https://nationaleczema.org/eczema\" target=\"_new\">eczema</a>.</p>",

Now, South Korean research supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen treatments to restore hearing in these patients.</p><p>A review of the collected evidence suggests that -- added to standard drug therapy -- hyperbaric oxygen treatment \"is the most beneficial treatment option\" for what doctors call \"sudden sensorineural hearing loss,\" according to a team led by Dr. Tae-Min Rhee. He's a specialist in hyperbaric medicine at the National Maritime Medical Center in Seoul.</p><p>One expert in the United States explained that this type of sudden hearing loss is rare but very troubling to patients.</p><p>\"Sensorineural hearing loss occurs in about 1 out of 10,000 people,\" said Dr. Darius Kohan, and is thought to be triggered by a viral infection or circulatory problems within the ear. Kohan directs otology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>He said that 1 in every 3 people will get their hearing back without any treatment. For the other two-thirds of patients, drugs -- most often steroids -- are used, as well as hyperbaric oxygen.</p><p>In this treatment, patients are placed in a device that boosts oxygen levels in the inner ear.</p> <p>But just how well does the therapy work? To find out, Rhee's group looked at data from 19 studies that compared outcomes for people with sensorineural hearing loss. Patients either received drug therapy alone or drug therapy plus hyperbaric oxygen. A total of more than 2,400 patients, averaging 45 years of age, were included.</p>  <p>The team found that people who got the combo therapy were 61 percent more likely to achieve complete hearing recovery compared to people who only got medicines. The average amount of hearing recovery was also higher, overall, for people who got both therapies rather than drugs alone.</p><p>Also, hyperbaric oxygen appeared most helpful for those patients who had experienced the most profound hearing loss.</p><p>Therefore, adding hyperbaric oxygen therapy to steroids or other drug treatment seems to be a \"reasonable option\" for people with this form of sudden hearing loss, Rhee's team said.</p><p>Kohan did have a few caveats, however. First, he said the analysis couldn't control for certain variables -- the dosage and timing of drug treatment, for example, or the presence (or not) of vertigo or tinnitus (ringing in the ears), which often accompanies sudden hearing loss.</p><p>He believes that \"far more studies, with much more stringent criteria and controlled variables are required to make more definitive conclusions.\"</p><p>Finally, there's the cost of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The study found that benefits usually appeared after at least 20 hours of therapy, and Kohan noted that hyperbaric oxygen typically costs $300 per hour in the United States.</p><p>The findings were published Sept. 27 in <i>JAMA Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders has more about <a href=\"https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/sudden-deafness\" target=\"_new\">sudden hearing loss</a>.</p>",

He's a doctoral student at Griffith University in South East Queensland.</p><p>\"Our research found that girls generally exhibit better reading and writing ability than boys as early as the fourth grade,\" he added.</p><p>For the study, the researchers examined a nationally representative sample of standardized test scores compiled over 27 years. The 3.4 million U.S. students tested included fourth, eighth and 12th graders.</p><p>The tests showed that by the fourth grade, girls scored much higher than boys in reading and writing. This disparity increased over the next eight years. By 12th grade, however, the gender gap in writing was more significant than it was for reading.</p><p>\"It appears that the gender gap for writing tasks has been greatly underestimated, and that despite our best efforts with changes in teaching methods does not appear to be reducing over time,\" Reilly said in a news release from the American Psychological Association.</p><p>Statistically, boys are at higher risk for learning disabilities than girls. In addition, boys may be less likely than girls to prioritize reading because of peer pressure to obey \"masculine norms,\" the study authors suggested.</p><p>Behavioral problems may also play a role. The researchers said there are gender differences in issues such as  physical aggression, defiance and attention disorders. Such conditions have been linked with reading and writing problems. \"These can be disruptive in the classroom, but might also point to a neurological contribution,\" Reilly said. </p><p>The researchers added that previous studies have also shown that girls use both hemispheres of the brain while reading and writing. Boys, on the other hand, are more likely to rely on only one side of their brain.</p><p>\"Bilateral language function presumably affords some benefits, which could explain the female advantage observed on such tasks,\" Reilly said.</p><p>The authors caution that reading and writing are the foundation for academic success later on. \"While we've concentrated on basic literacy, the demands on students for writing grow stronger as they progress through education. In particular, it's crucial for high school and college entry,\" Reilly said. \"Each year, more women than men apply for college entry, and more women than men complete their college degrees. It has a cascading effect on students, either up or down.\"</p><p>However, the study isn't  endorsing single-sex education, he said. \"Rather, it suggests that we need to better tailor our education to meet the needs of boys and really encourage in them early a love not just of reading but also writing,\" Reilly said.</p><p>The study was published Sept. 20 in <i>American Psychologist</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics has more about <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/school/Pages/Help-Your-Child-Enjoy-Reading-Aloud-Tips-for-Parents.aspx\" target=\"_new\"> encouraging kids to read</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 20, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Not all the toys in Santa's sack are safe to play with. Among this year's most dangerous playthings are data-collecting dolls and fidget spinners full of lead, a new report says.</p><p>\"We should be able to trust that the toys we buy are safe. However, until that's the case, toy buyers need to watch out for common hazards when shopping for children's presents,\" said Dev Gowda, of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) Education Fund. </p><p>\"No child should ever be injured, get sick, or die from playing with a dangerous toy,\" Gowda said in a news release from the group.</p><p>The organization's annual \"Trouble in Toyland\" report highlights a number of dangers, including data-collecting toys that may violate children's privacy. </p><p>One example is a doll called My Friend Cayla that was found for sale at Walmart and Kohl's.</p><p>The doll has been banned in Germany for privacy violations. It is also the subject of a complaint by several consumer groups to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission because it may violate the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.</p><p>In July, the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a warning to consumers to \"consider cybersecurity prior to introducing smart, interactive, internet-connected toys into their homes,\" according to the \"Trouble in Toyland\" report.</p><p>Two fidget spinners sold at Target and distributed by Bulls i Toy, L.L.C., were found to have dangerously high levels of lead. The Wild Premium Spinner Brass had 33,000 parts per million of lead, which is more than 300 times the legal limit for lead in children' s products. The Fidget Wild Premium Spinner Metal had 1,300 ppm of lead.</p><p>Target has said it will remove the fidget spinners from store shelves.</p><p>\"Even small amounts of lead in toys can be ingested when transferred from fingers to mouth or from fingers to food,\" said Dr. Helen Binns, a lead expert and professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.</p><p>\"Lead harms the developing brain and is easily ingested through normal hand-to-mouth behaviors. Beware of these two fidget spinners, as they have dangerous amounts of lead,\" Binns said.</p><p>Despite a ban on small parts in toys for children under age 3, the report highlighted several toys that contain small parts, but have no warning label. These included a peg game, golf, and football travel games sold at Dollar Tree.</p><p>Balloons can get stuck in children's throats. They cause more choking deaths among children than any other toy or children's product.</p><p>The researchers found five balloon sets on store shelves that were either marketed to children under 8 or have misleading warning labels that make it appear they are safe for children between ages 3 and 8. They were at Dollar Tree (H2O Blasters - Water Balloons and Disney Princess Punch Ball Balloons); Party City (Mega Value Pack 12 Water Bomb Packs and Mega Value Pack 14 Latex Punch Balloons); and Dollar City Plus (Party Balloons - 10).</p><p>Numerous hoverboards continue to be recalled by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) for faulty battery packs.</p><p>Many hoverboards have been taken off store shelves over the past year, but they still pose a threat to children. Earlier this year, two young girls and a firefighter died in a house fire believed to be caused by a hoverboard that was charging and overheated. Last month, another house fire was attributed to a hoverboard.</p><p>\"Our leaders and consumer watchdogs need to do more to protect our youngest consumers from the hazards of unsafe toys,\" Gowda said.</p><p>If you're a parent or guardian, some steps you can take to protect children from unsafe toys include subscribing to email recall updates from the CPSC and other U.S. government safety agencies. You can also use the toy safety tips on U.S. PIRG Education Fund's website, and report unsafe toys or toy-related injuries to the CPSC.</p><p>You should regularly check that toys for older children are not left within reach of younger children who still put things in their mouths. Also, eliminate small magnet hazards from your home.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has more on <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/safety-education/safety-guides/toys\" target=\"_new\">toy safety</a>.</p>",

But exercise is an essential part of an overall treatment plan to ease RA symptoms and improve mobility. Aim for a weekly routine that includes stretching, cardio and strength training.</p><p>Stretching boosts flexibility and range of motion. First, warm muscles with 5 minutes of light movement, then do a series of stretches to target all muscle groups. Always hold each stretch for 20 seconds. Yoga and tai chi are specific activities that increase flexibility and may even help ease the emotional stress of RA. To learn the basics, take a class or work one-on-one with an instructor, at least at first.</p><p>You can get the benefits of cardio with low-impact exercises, which are easier on your joints than a pounding activity like running. Walking is great, but swimming and water workouts put even less stress on joints because of the buoyancy of the water.</p><p>Support your joints by strengthening the muscles around them with resistance exercises. You can use stretchy resistance bands if weights are too hard to manage. Pay special attention to the muscles surrounding the joints most affected by rheumatoid arthritis, but don't neglect other muscle groups.</p><p>Work with your rheumatologist or a physical therapist familiar with RA to develop an individualized plan and ask how you should tailor your activities when a flare strikes.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Arthritis Foundation has more tips to help you find <a href=\"http://www.arthritis.org/about-arthritis/types/rheumatoid-arthritis/articles/best-exercises-for-ra.php\" target=\"_new\">the best exercises</a> when you have RA.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Oct. 2, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Only a small percentage of Americans have had their DNA analyzed -- but many are tempted to try it, according to new research. </p><p>For the study, University of Michigan researchers surveyed nearly 1,000 adults aged 50 to 64. While curious about their ancestry or health risks, the majority said they fear they'll worry excessively if they learn they have genetic links to progressive diseases like macular degeneration, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.</p><p>\"Compared to previous findings in the general adult population, this age group appears to be a little more lukewarm about their views of the benefits versus the risks of genetic testing overall,\" Scott Roberts, a professor at the U-M School of Public Health, said in a university news release. </p><p>Overall, 14 percent of those polled had undergone either a direct-to-consumer genetic test or a test ordered by a doctor. Broken down further, more than one in 10 had ordered a genetic test themselves. One in 20 had taken a doctor-ordered DNA test, the findings showed. </p><p>The University of Michigan's National Poll on Healthy Aging also found that more than half of those polled were interested in DNA testing to help guide their medical care, shed light on their risk for disease and learn about their ancestry.</p><p>And 70 percent said they might want to learn their risk for Alzheimer's disease. On the positive side, genetics testing might help people decide if they should take steps to protect their health by enrolling in clinical drug trials for Alzheimer's, the researchers said.</p><p>Alison Bryant is senior vice president of research for AARP. \"We're living in an era when advances like DNA testing are providing an amazing amount of useful health information,\" she said.</p><p>\"As genetic testing becomes even more sophisticated and common among older adults, the challenge will be to ensure that people understand the benefits and limitations of these tests,\" Bryant said.</p><p>Around nine in 10 adults believe genetic testing can shed light on their own health risks, and those of their children and grandchildren, the poll found. But roughly 40 percent feel a genetic test is unnecessary if a family's medical history and risk factors are already known.</p><p>And two-thirds thought genetic testing would cause excessive worry about their long-term health. The researchers added that people who simply want to learn where they come from could be unexpectedly alarmed about their genetic risk for a debilitating disease. </p><p>It's important to remember that genetic test results are not 100 percent accurate, the researchers cautioned. Also, if you take a doctor-ordered DNA test, you can meet with a genetic counselor to help interpret the results. But if you buy a genetic test directly, you won't have access to these services.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. National Library of Medicine has information on different types of <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/testing/uses\" target=\"_new\"> genetic tests</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Oct. 29, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Parents of teens can add \"sextortion\" to the list of things to worry about, because a new study shows that 5 percent of teenagers are targets of this cybercrime.</p><p>Another 3 percent of teens have likely done it to others, the study authors added.</p><p>Sextortion is threatening to share sexually explicit photos without consent if a person doesn't agree to certain demands, such as sexual favors or money. </p><p>Probably the most well-known case of sextortion was Canadian teenager Amanda Todd. She was only 12 years old when someone she met online talked her into lifting up her shirt in front of a web cam.</p><p>It turned out that that person wasn't another teen. He was a grown man, and he threatened to share the images of her breasts at her school if she didn't put on another sexual show for him. She refused and he followed through on his threat.</p><p>In fact, he followed her online and shared the images again when she changed schools. He tortured her so relentlessly, and recruited others to do so as well, that she ended up taking her own life just before her 16th birthday.</p><p>\"Some kids make mistakes, and today the consequences can be pretty major and can follow them and affect them deeply psychologically and socially,\" said study author Sameer Hinduja.</p><p>\"Teens in first love believe they'll be together forever, and don't want to do anything to ruin the relationship,\" he explained.</p><p>Hinduja is a professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University in Jupiter.</p><p>Hinduja said he hasn't seen a specific sextortion law, but that charges for these behaviors can be filed under existing laws, such as laws on blackmail and extortion.</p><p>Dr. Richard Catanzaro, chairman of psychiatry at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y.,  said, \"Sextortion is just the latest form of online predation. All predators work by preying on people who feel isolated and, because they think there is no recourse, are forced to submit.\"</p><p>The study included a nationally representative sample of more than 5,500 middle and high school students aged 12 to 17. </p><p>Males were much more likely to have participated in sextortion than females -- either as a victim or the perpetrator.</p><p>Teens who identified as non-heterosexual were more than twice as likely to be the victim of sextortion. This finding is similar to other research that shows gay and transgender children are more likely to be involved in online abuse.</p><p>Fifteen appears to be the most common age to be involved in sextortion, the new study found.</p><p>One finding parents may find particularly alarming is that teens being victimized by sextortion attempts usually know the person trying to take advantage of them. They may have been a romantic partner or a friend. It's  unusual for someone to be targeted by a stranger, the researchers said.</p><p>Hinduja advises teens to \"be more vigilant with your relationships. You don't need to be obsessed with keeping a relationship at all costs.\" </p><p>Psychologist Judy Malinowski, from Ascension Health in Novi, Mich., pointed out that the \"human brain isn't fully matured until the mid- to late-20s.\" She explained that activities such as sex and aggression actually give kids a chemical surge in the brain (similar to one that people using drugs or gambling feel) that makes them feel good. </p><p>\"The power of that feeling is overriding common sense. They're getting such an emotional surge that whatever conscious thought they might have about what could happen is being shut off,\" Malinowski said.</p><p>Both Malinowski and Catanzaro said that if a teen is being victimized, he or she needs to talk to a parent or other trusted adult.</p><p> \"Find someone you can trust. Reach out to that one person -- coach, counselor, aunt, teacher, whoever -- and tell them this is happening and you don't know what to do about it,\" Malinowski said.</p><p>Catanzaro added, \"Find one rational adult in which to confide and get support from peers by speaking to friends. And, when something like this happens, think about the worst-case scenario. All people have a way of catastrophizing. If you think of the worst possible outcome, you will probably realize it's not as bad as more sexual exploitation.\" </p><p>The findings were published online recently in the journal <i>Sexual Abuse</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics has advice on talking to your kids about <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/news-features-and-safety-tips/Pages/Talking-to-Kids-and-Teens-About-Social-Media-and-Sexting.aspx\" target=\"_new\">sexting</a>.</p>",

Recently, at least 11 children at a New Jersey rehab facility died of adenovirus-related illness, <i>CBS News</i> reported.</p><p>The University of Maryland student who died was identified as Olivia Paregol, who was in her first semester of college. The university's health center said it learned of her illness on Nov. 1.</p><p>In a letter, the university said that \"the testing of one specimen sent to the CDC revealed Adenovirus 7, a strain that may cause more severe illness,\" <i>CBS News</i> reported.</p><p>The letter said departments campus-wide began increased cleaning of surfaces early in November in response to the situation, and warned students to be vigilant, particularly those with asthma, diabetes and those who have illnesses or take medications that weaken the immune system.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Cigarette Boxes to Carry 'Corrective Statements' Outlining Health Risks</b></span></p><p>Federal court-ordered \"corrective statements\" that outline the health dangers of smoking will soon appear on cigarette boxes sold in the United States.</p><p>In 2006, federal Judge Gladys Kessler ordered tobacco companies to issue \"corrective statements\" on their packaging, on company websites, and in print and television ads. The order was the result of a 1999 lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice against the tobacco industry.</p><p>As part of that court order, tobacco companies last year launched and paid for \"corrective statement\" ads on television and in newspapers. The requirement for statements on cigarette boxes takes effect Wednesday, <i>CNN</i> reported.</p><p>The statements explain that smoking is highly addictive, that it's difficult to quit, that nicotine changes the brain, and that all cigarettes can cause cancer, lung disease and heart attacks, and other health problems.</p><p>\"We are at a point where 480,000 people a year die from tobacco use,\" Mary Rouvelas, senior counsel for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, told <i>CNN</i>.</p><p>The network was one of the groups involved in the lawsuit against the tobacco industry.</p><p>\"We want to make sure that the public knows about the harms of smoking.

Unhealthy exposure to these bioaerosols is very possible after a flood from a hurricane and especially during cleanup efforts 24 to 48 hours after the storm,\" she said in a university news release.</p> <p>Exposure to mold primarily affects the lungs and the skin, Schenck said. How you react to mold depends on the severity of your exposure. Some people may be more susceptible to mold-related illnesses than others, including children and those with a weakened immune system, asthma or another chronic illness.</p><p>Warning signs of mold-related health issues include:</p><ul><li>Nasal congestion and sneezing. </li><li>Hoarse voice and throat irritation.</li><li>Cough, wheezing, shortness of breath or chest tightness.</li><li>Flareup of asthma symptoms.</li><li>Respiratory symptoms. </li><li>Extreme tiredness.</li></ul><p>These symptoms may not develop right away, Schenck noted. She advised doctors to be extra vigilant about educating their patients about mold risk following a storm or natural disaster.</p><p>During a post-storm cleanup, the UConn experts advised the following:</p><ul><li>Assume any areas exposed to water or flooding for more than 24 hours have mold  even if it's not apparent. </li><li>While cleaning mold, use an \"N95\" respirator that has bands to hold the mask close to the face. Dust and surgical masks will not protect against mold and mold spores. People at high risk for mold-related illnesses should not attempt to personally clean up following a flood. If water damage covers more than 100-square-feet, seek professional help with the cleanup. </li><li>Wear protective clothing. Cover the skin on the arms, hands, legs and feet while cleaning mold. Use long rubber gloves that extend to the middle of the forearm. </li><li>Wear unvented goggles during mold cleanup to protect the eyes. </li><li>Clean hard surfaces with soapy water.  Avoid using bleach or other \"fungicides\" unless there is contamination from other flooded materials such as sewage. These harsh chemicals aren't more effective than soapy water and could cause or worsen lung irritation. </li>    <li>Don't attempt to clean soft materials and porous surfaces like fabrics and wall board.  Throw away these items. </li></ul> <p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency offers more on <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/natural-disasters/hurricanes#recover\" target=\"_new\"> hurricane safety and preparedness</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 10, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- With sales of electronic cigarettes skyrocketing, Americans remain divided on whether the devices are a boon or a threat to public health.</p><p>That's the main finding of a new <i>HealthDay/Harris Poll</i> that surveyed over 2,000 adults on their e-cigarette views.</p><p>Vaping has long been promoted as a way to help smokers kick the habit -- offering them a route to get nicotine without the carcinogens in tobacco smoke.</p><p>But e-cigarettes aren't harmless, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health authorities. There's particular concern about young people vaping -- in part, because nicotine can harm brain development, which continues until about age 25.</p><p>In the poll, most adults did have misgivings about e-cigarettes: 85 percent said they were worried that the long-term health effects of the devices are unknown; and 83 percent were at least \"somewhat\" concerned about teenagers using e-cigarettes.</p><p>In fact, 43 percent of adults felt that e-cigarettes are actually more dangerous than traditional cigarettes.</p><p>On the flip side, about as many people (41 percent) viewed e-cigarettes as \"healthier\" than traditional cigarettes. And 42 percent rated them as an \"excellent way\" to quit.</p><p>It all adds up to differing views, and possibly confusion, about e-cigarettes and their health effects.</p><p>There are, in fact, many unknowns.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, at this time we have no scientific evidence on the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes, especially given the unknown effects of the aerosols and flavorings in e-cigarette liquids,\" said Dr. Thanh-Huyen Vu, a research assistant professor at Northwestern University in Chicago.</p><p>However, researchers know plenty about nicotine.</p><p>The drug \"is well known to be addictive and toxic, and to have adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and on health in general,\" Vu said.</p><p>And that's enough to raise concerns about teenagers' e-cigarette use,  she added.</p><p>In addition, Vu said, studies have found that teenagers and young adults who use e-cigarettes are more likely than non-users to take up smoking.</p><p>And what about adults who use e-cigarettes in place of traditional ones?</p><p>The devices do allow people to avoid the chemicals they would inhale from burning tobacco, Vu noted.</p><p>\"It's been speculated that using them may be associated with better health outcomes, compared to traditional cigarette smoking,\" she said.</p><p>But again, Vu pointed out, there's the nicotine and its own health effects.</p><p>E-cigarettes come in different forms, with some emulating traditional cigarettes or pipes. One highly popular brand, called Juul, is shaped like a USB flash drive, and reportedly accounts for one-third of e-cigarette sales in the United States.</p><p>Last week, the CDC reported that Juul sales shot up 641 percent between 2016 and 2017. Researchers called the trend worrying because the devices have a particularly high nicotine content and are popular with young people.</p><p>\"No teenager should be vaping,\" said Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association -- referring to a common term for e-cigarette use.</p><p>However, Conley disputed the notion that e-cigarettes are driving kids to smoke. As researchers from the University of Buffalo recently argued, teen smoking has continued to decline at the same time e-cigarette use has risen.</p><p>Conley questioned the poll finding that 43 percent of people think e-cigarettes are more dangerous than traditional cigarettes. He said past surveys have found less fear around the devices.</p><p>But if people do think vaping is worse than smoking, Conley blamed misleading messages from certain researchers and media stories.</p><p>\"As long as vaping is helping smokers quit, it will bring public health benefits,\" he said.</p><p>Conley pointed to research evidence of that: Last year, a study at Georgetown University estimated that up to 6.6 million smokers would live \"substantially longer\" if they replaced their traditional cigarettes with e-cigarettes.</p><p>And a 2016 report from the Royal College of Physicians concluded that e-cigarettes -- when used by smokers aiming to quit -- are \"likely\" to benefit public health.</p><p>Still, Vu said that based on studies so far, it's unclear how effective the devices really are in helping smokers ultimately quit. \"E-cigarette use is still new, so it will take time to prove,\" she added.</p><p>This HealthDay/Harris Poll was conducted online within the United States between Sept. 25-27 2018, among 2,008 U.S. adults (aged 18 and over). This online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore no estimate of theoretical sampling error can be calculated.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The CDC has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">electronic cigarettes</a>.</p>",

Unhealthy exposure to these bioaerosols is very possible after a flood from a hurricane and especially during cleanup efforts 24 to 48 hours after the storm,\" she said in a university news release.</p> <p>Exposure to mold primarily affects the lungs and the skin, Schenck said. How you react to mold depends on the severity of your exposure. Some people may be more susceptible to mold-related illnesses than others, including children and those with a weakened immune system, asthma or another chronic illness.</p><p>Warning signs of mold-related health issues include:</p><ul><li>Nasal congestion and sneezing. </li><li>Hoarse voice and throat irritation.</li><li>Cough, wheezing, shortness of breath or chest tightness.</li><li>Flare-up of asthma symptoms.</li><li>Respiratory symptoms. </li><li>Extreme tiredness.</li></ul><p>These symptoms may not develop right away, Schenck noted. She advised doctors to be extra vigilant about educating their patients about mold risk following a storm or natural disaster.</p><p>During a post-storm cleanup, the UConn experts advised the following:</p><ul><li>Assume any areas exposed to water or flooding for more than 24 hours have mold -- even if it's not apparent. </li><li>While cleaning mold, use an \"N95\" respirator that has bands to hold the mask close to the face. Dust and surgical masks will not protect against mold and mold spores. People at high risk for mold-related illnesses should not attempt to personally clean up following a flood. If water damage covers more than 100-square-feet, seek professional help with the cleanup. </li><li>Wear protective clothing. Cover the skin on the arms, hands, legs and feet while cleaning mold. Use long rubber gloves that extend to the middle of the forearm. </li><li>Wear unvented goggles during mold cleanup to protect the eyes. </li><li>Clean hard surfaces with soapy water.  Avoid using bleach or other \"fungicides\" unless there is contamination from other flooded materials, such as sewage. These harsh chemicals aren't more effective than soapy water and could cause or worsen lung irritation. </li>    <li>Don't attempt to clean soft materials and porous surfaces like fabrics and wall board.  Throw away these items. </li></ul> <p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency offers more on <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/natural-disasters/hurricanes#recover\" target=\"_new\"> hurricane safety and preparedness</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Sept. 19, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- If a pregnant woman eats a lot of high-gluten foods, the odds that her child will have type 1 diabetes rise significantly, new research suggests.</p><p>In the study, pregnant women who had the highest consumption of gluten had double the risk of having a child with type 1 diabetes compared to those who ate the least gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye and barley. </p><p>However, the study authors noted that it's too soon to recommend that pregnant women change their diets based on the results of this one study.</p><p>\"The study brings new ideas to how type 1 diabetes develops. We did not know that the pregnancy period is important for the development of the disease [or] that the development of the disease is starting that early in life,\" said study co-author Dr. Knud Josefsen.</p><p> \"And it also holds the potential to reduce the frequency of the disease by simply changing the diet during pregnancy,\" added Josefsen, a senior researcher at the Bartholin Institute in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p><p>However, \"the study is observational and the link that we describe is an association,\" and not a cause-and-effect relationship, Josefsen said. The research also needs to be repeated in other populations. </p><p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that causes the body's immune system to mistakenly attack the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, according to JDRF (formerly Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation). Insulin is a hormone that helps usher the sugar from foods into the body's cells to be used as fuel. </p><p>The attack on the immune system cells leaves someone with type 1 diabetes with little to no insulin. Without insulin injections -- via multiple shots a day or an insulin pump -- someone with type 1 diabetes doesn't have enough insulin to survive. </p><p>Gluten is found in many foods -- including bread, pasta, cereal, crackers and cookies -- according to the Celiac Disease Foundation. Gluten triggers the immune system disorder called celiac disease that causes damage to the small intestine when gluten is consumed.</p><p>There's already a known link between celiac disease and type 1 diabetes -- approximately 10 percent of people with type 1 diabetes also have celiac disease, Josefsen said.</p><p>The latest study included data from almost 64,000 pregnant women enrolled from 1996 through 2002. Nearly 250 of these women's children developed type 1 diabetes. </p><p>The women answered questions about the foods they ate when they were 25 weeks' pregnant. </p><p>The average gluten intake was 13 grams per day. The range was less than 7 grams per day to more than 20 grams per day. Josefsen said a slice of bread has about 3 grams of gluten. A large serving of pasta -- about two-thirds of a cup -- has 5 to 10 grams of gluten, he said.</p><p>The researchers found that a child's risk of type 1 diabetes increased proportionally with every 10 grams of the mother's daily gluten intake. </p><p>Josefsen said there are some theories as to how gluten might contribute to the rise of type 1 diabetes. One is that gluten may cause inflammation and an immune response. </p><p>Maija Miettinen, co-author of an editorial that accompanied the study, said most of the theories as to how these two conditions might be related come from animal models. Like Josefsen, she said more research is needed.</p><p>\"This is the first study to suggest an association between high gluten intake during pregnancy and the risk of type 1 diabetes in the offspring. Therefore, it is too early to change dietary recommendations concerning gluten intake,\" she said. Miettinen is a researcher with the National Institute for Health and Welfare in Helsinki, Finland.</p><p>Miettinen also pointed out that women who have high-gluten diets in pregnancy may also continue to serve their children high-gluten fare. \"We do not know whether the possible risk associated with high gluten intake comes through prenatal exposure, childhood diet or both,\" she said. </p><p>The study was published online Sept. 19 in the <i>BMJ</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p> Harvard T.H.

He is director of spinal deformity surgery at the Spine Hospital at New York-Presbyterian in New York City.</p><p>For more complicated spinal problems such as scoliosis, stenosis, fractures or injuries, medical intervention is usually necessary, Lenke said. </p><p>\"But each person with or without spinal problems can benefit from adopting healthier lifestyle habits to keep your spine as strong as possible,\" he said.</p><p>Lenke offered this advice: </p><ul><li>Maintain a healthy weight, don't smoke, do stretching and strengthening exercises that increase back and abdomen flexibility, and get regular cardiovascular exercise. If your job involves a lot of sitting, get up and walk around every 15 to 30 minutes.</li><li>Maintain good posture even while sitting. Don't slouch or hold your head too far forward. Be sure your feet are supported, hips are level with or slightly above the knees and your spine is slightly reclined. There should be a small arch in the lower back.</li><li>When sitting at a computer, your shoulders should be relaxed and away from the ears. Your elbows should be at the sides, bent to about 90 degrees, and your wrists should be neutral -- not bent up, down or away from each other. Your head should face ahead without being too far forward.</li><li>When using a mobile device for non-voice activities, hold it up instead of bending your neck to look down. At just 45 degrees, the work your neck muscles are doing is equal to lifting a 50-pound bag of potatoes.</li><li>When lifting, make sure objects are properly balanced and packed correctly so weight won't shift. Keep the weight close to your body. And take your time. Bend at the hips and knees and use your legs to lift.

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Sept. 20, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Life expectancy in the United States has declined for two years in a row, fueled by increasing death rates from opioid drug overdoses, suicides and chronic liver disease, a new government report shows.</p><p>\"It's really the first time we've seen this multi-year drop\" in decades, said Renee Gindi, chief of the Analytic Studies Branch of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), part of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She's one of the lead coordinators for the report.</p><p>Babies now can expect to live 78.6 years on average, based on 2016 data that's the most recent, according to NCHS researchers.</p><p>That's down from 78.7 years in 2015 and 78.9 years in 2014.</p><p>\"We've been talking about the fact that our children will live less long than we will, and that's clearly coming to pass,\" said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.</p><p>Worse, it looks like the trend will continue for at least another year, said Benjamin, who wasn't involved with the research.</p><p>Preliminary CDC data released in May showed continuing increases in the leading causes of death in 2017, he noted.</p><p>\"I always tell people one year is interesting, two years is more interesting, and three years is a trend,\" Benjamin said.</p><p>Final longevity numbers for 2014 through 2016 were published Sept. 20 in <i>Health, United States, 2017</i>, an annual report produced by the NCHS.</p><p>Life expectancy at birth decreased by 0.2 years between 2014 and 2015, which was the first drop seen since 1993. It then decreased another 0.1 years between 2015 and 2016.</p><p>The opioid epidemic likely plays a large role in the continuing decline, the researchers said.</p><p>The age-adjusted death rate for drug overdose in the United States increased 72 percent between 2006 and 2016, and now stands at 19.8 deaths per 100,000 people.</p><p>There's also been a startling increase in the suicide rate. Between 2006 and 2016, the age-adjusted suicide death rate increased 23 percent, from 11 to 13.5 deaths per 100,000 people.</p><p>Suicides have been increasing in particular among military veterans and children, Benjamin said.</p><p>\"We don't understand all of the root causes of that, but we certainly are in a much more stressful society,\" Benjamin said. \"We have a huge population of people coming back from military service and [they] aren't necessarily getting the services they need to deal with mental health issues and traumatic brain injury.\"</p><p>Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis also appears to be driving the decline in life expectancy.</p><p>Death rates for chronic liver disease increased by an average 7.9 percent per year between 2006 and 2016 among men aged 25 to 34, the report found. Among women in the same age group, this increase averaged 11.4 percent per year.</p><p>This could have been caused by a number of factors, including alcohol use or hepatitis infection, Gindi said.</p><p>The report also noted increases in the rates of death caused by Alzheimer's disease and septicemia, or blood poisoning.</p><p>For decades, life expectancy increased based on public health measures people now take for granted, Gindi said -- modern sewers, clean water, vaccines.</p><p>More recently, a focus on caring for chronic diseases kept life expectancy growing.</p><p>\"When we acknowledged that chronic diseases played a larger role, we were able to start preventing and diagnosing and treating these in ways we hadn't been able to before, particularly heart disease and cancer,\" Gindi said.</p><p>But gains in life expectancy due to advances against heart disease and cancer have been flattening, Benjamin said, while these other causes of death have been increasing.</p><p>\"People were predicting this would be because of the obesity epidemic,\" Benjamin said of the downward trend in life expectancy. \"Not to say that doesn't play a role, but suicides and drug overdoses have eclipsed that in many ways and it's really a driving factor.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/life-expectancy.htm\" target=\"_new\">life expectancy</a> in the United States.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Oct 2, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Want to get consumers hungry for a chocolate-covered ant or crunchy cricket snack?</p><p>New research suggests that if you're marketing protein-rich insects as edibles, emphasizing flavor and luxury is key.</p><p>So finds an advertising experiment that aimed to get 180 Germans to embrace entomophagy, a verbal mouthful that basically means \"eating insects.\"</p><p>Aware of the hard sell at hand, lead investigator Sebastian Berger highlighted several  reasons -- none having to do with taste -- to seriously consider an insect-based cuisine.</p><p>\"They are rich in protein, environmentally friendly and a healthy option compared to traditional meats,\" Berger noted. And with 25 percent of all man-made greenhouse gas emissions tracing back to food production, he said insect harvesting produces just a \"fraction\" of the greenhouse gases emitted in producing meat products.</p><p>Berger is an associate professor in the department of organization and human resource management at the University of Bern in Switzerland.</p><p>In the end, however \"delicious\" trumped \"healthy\" in gaining new fans of mealworms and crickets, Berger said.</p><p>\"The majority of humans eat insects, or come from a culture in which insect-eating is normal,\" he observed. But Berger acknowledged that in the Western world, the practice is \"predominantly associated with the emotion [of] disgust.\"</p><p>Given that, \"it is to be expected that utilitarian [nutrition] ads don't work well in the case of eating insects.\"</p><p>In the study, volunteers were described as \"well-educated\" and ranged in age from 18 to 72.</p><p>In a lab setting, all were told the study concerned \"new products,\" rather than insect food. After completing a food questionnaire, all reviewed an information sheet containing one of two ad options for a start-up insect food company. The first promoted insects as \"exquisite\" or good for the body or environment. The second ad promoted insect food as \"delicious,\" \"exotic\" or \"trendy.\"</p><p>The participants were then asked if they would try a mealworm chocolate truffle recipe.</p><p>After critiquing a food presentation, those who chose to eat the truffle indicated what they thought of it.</p><p>About 76 percent of those who saw an ad that emphasized the pleasure, tastiness, quality or luxury of eating an insect decided to try the truffle. That compared with just 61 percent of those shown an ad promoting nutritional and environmental benefits; 57 percent of those shown a nutrition-focused ad; and 66 percent presented with an environmental benefits ad.</p><p>Similarly, those who saw so-called pleasure-based ads were more inclined to actually like the mealworm truffle than those who saw ads focused on health and/or the environment.</p><p>The findings were published in the September issue of the journal <i>Frontiers in Nutrition</i>.</p><p>The notion that \"people eat for taste first\" makes sense to Connie Diekman, director of university nutrition at Washington University in St. Louis.</p><p>\"I've seen this as a registered dietitian,\" she said. \"If a food doesn't taste good, no matter how healthful or how environmentally friendly, people will not eat the food.\"</p><p>And insects would definitely not be an exception to that rule, suggested Diekman, who is also the former president of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.</p><p>\"If the taste is enjoyable, people might overcome the perception issue, but -- as with so many novel foods -- introduction would need to be gradual, [and] very much focused on taste and usage tips.\"</p><p>But dietitian Lona Sandon was not having it, pouring cold water on the notion of a plate of steaming hot grasshoppers.</p><p>\"The U.S. population in general is not ready for eating insects, myself included,\" said Sandon, program director of the department of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. </p><p>\"Until it becomes a cultural and socially acceptable food source, companies trying to sell insect flour or other insect-based foods will be facing a huge culture barrier to overcome in the U.S. market,\" she said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has more information on <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/edible-insects/en\" target=\"_new\">insects as food</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 3, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- If you think your nightly glass of vino is doing good things for your health, think again. </p><p>A new study suggests that folks who like to tip back a drink or two every day are more likely to die prematurely.</p><p>\"At any given age, if you drink daily -- even just one or two drinks -- you have a 20 percent increased risk of death compared to someone who drinks the same amount two to three times a week,\" said study author Dr. Sarah Hartz. She's an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.</p><p>\"We should no longer say that it's healthy to drink. It's a vice that's not great for us,\" she added. </p><p>Hartz noted that how significant a 20 percent increased risk of death is depends on your age. She explained that since very few people die in their 20s, a 20 percent increased risk of premature death is less significant at that age than it would be for someone in their 70s. </p><p>Although the study did find an association, it did not prove that light drinking caused early death risk to rise.</p> <p>But how might alcohol boost that risk? </p><p>Hartz said most of the increased risk of early death comes from an increased risk of cancer. She said that people often underestimate how much drinking can increase the risk of some cancers, such as breast cancer.  And drinking more than four times a week can also increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.</p><p>But what of all the studies that have suggested a health benefit from moderate drinking? </p><p>Hartz said that there have been several studies this year that have concluded that drinking generally isn't good for health. And the populations in these studies and the latest one are larger than in previous ones. More importantly, she noted, the newer studies have been able to parse out the lowest levels of drinking. </p><p>\"We have access to data we haven't had access to before,\" Hartz explained. </p><p>The study included information from more than 400,000 people. More than 340,000 (aged 18 to 85) had participated in a national health survey. Another group of nearly 94,000 were between the ages of 40 and 60 and had been treated as outpatients at Veterans Health Administration clinics. </p><p>\"The lowest risk group was people who drank one or two drinks just two to three times weekly,\" she said.</p><p>Still, not everyone is convinced that this study is the last word on alcohol and health. </p><p>According to Dr. Guy Mintz, director of cardiovascular health and lipidology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., \"The jury is still out with regard to frequency and quantity of alcohol use.\" </p><p>Mintz said, \"This is an interesting study. One to two drinks four days a week seemed to protect against cardiovascular disease, but drinking every day eliminated those benefits.\" </p><p>He pointed out that \"one of the study's conclusions was that, as medicine becomes more personalized, some patients with a history of cardiovascular disease may benefit from drinking two or three days a week, but those with a higher risk of cancer may not benefit.\" </p><p> Mintz tells his patients to drink anything but beer because it has a lot of calories and salt, and can contribute to obesity and high triglycerides (an unhealthy type of blood fat).  \"I would stress alcohol consumption in moderation, both in frequency and quantity,\" he said. </p><p>The study was published online Oct. 3 in the journal <i>Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about alcohol and its effects on the body from the <a href=\"https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/alcohols-effects-body\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Sept. 20, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Sleep apnea is a known risk factor for stroke, and new research suggests that curbing the condition might also aid the recovery of people who've suffered a stroke or mini-stroke.</p><p>Patients in the study typically used the  CPAP mask -- \"continuous positive airway pressure\" -- to ease their nighttime breathing difficulties.</p><p>The investigators found that, among stroke patients, \"treatment of sleep apnea with CPAP therapy provides significant benefits, even greater than the benefits of tPA, the FDA-approved drug treatment for stroke,\" said study lead researcher Dr. Dawn Bravata.</p><p>\"That's a substantial clinical effect,\" she said. \"The added good news for stroke patients is that CPAP has been used as a sleep apnea therapy for many years, and it has an excellent safety record.\"  Bravata is a research scientist with the Regenstrief Institute and Roudebush VA Medical Center in Indianapolis.</p><p>According to the researchers, sleep apnea is common among people who've had a stroke or mini-stroke, but few are currently diagnosed and treated for the condition. It's estimated that two out of three stroke patients are thought to have the condition, which causes irregular breathing during sleep. Sleep apnea can lead to low oxygen levels, high blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat.</p><p>In the new study, Bravata's group tracked outcomes for 252 people who had experienced a stroke or mini-stroke (known as a transient ischemic attack, or TIA) for up to one year. Patients were treated at one of five different hospitals in two states.</p><p>The patients were randomly divided into three groups: a control group who received standard care without sleep apnea treatment; standard care plus CPAP therapy; or enhanced care with CPAP therapy.  Patients who used CPAP did so for an average of 50 percent of nights.</p><p>The researchers reported that 59 percent of patients who received CPAP therapy showed marked improvement in their recovery, in terms of improvements in neurological symptoms. This compared with 38 percent of those who didn't get CPAP.</p><p>Timing of therapy may be key, as well, the study authors said.</p><p>\"Preliminary data suggests the sooner you treat sleep apnea in stroke patients with CPAP, the more potent the effect of that treatment,\" Bravata said in a Regenstrief news release.</p><p>\"Usually, diagnosing sleep apnea is an outpatient service. But we need to make sleep testing acutely available to stroke and TIA patients in the hospital as part of their work-up,\" she said, \"just as we do brain imaging, lab testing and cardiac monitoring as part of the initial stroke/TIA evaluation.\"</p><p>Two experts in stroke care believe the approach has real merit.</p><p>\"This study is very interesting --  it shows that a simple intervention, treating obstructive sleep apnea, can improve outcomes in stroke patients,\" said Dr. Andrew Rogrove. He is director of stroke services at Northwell Health's Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y.</p>  <p> Rogrove said it would be even more interesting to assess recovery rates when CPAP was used more frequently than the 50 percent of nights observed in this study.</p><p>Dr. Salman Azhar directs stroke care at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He noted that several studies have shown sleep apnea to be a factor in poor stroke recovery.</p><p>Testing for sleep apnea shouldn't add much to the burden of care for stroke survivors, Azhar added.</p><p> \"With the current ease of doing home sleep studies, the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea has become much simpler and should be considered in all stroke patients with positive screening questionnaire results,\" he said.</p><p>The findings were published earlier this month in the <i>Journal of the American Heart Association</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has more about  <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/sleep-apnea\" target=\"_new\"> sleep apnea</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 10, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- It's been 70 years since a small, middle-class community 23 miles west of Boston became the linchpin in helping to solve the mysteries of heart disease.</p> <p>Smoking. Cholesterol. Blood pressure. Obesity. It's common knowledge today that these all can lead to heart trouble. But in the 1940s, with one in two deaths caused by cardiovascular disease and even after President Franklin Roosevelt died from the effects of heart failure and a massive stroke, the information would have been considered revolutionary.</p> <p>The world has changed by leaps and bounds since Oct. 11, 1948, when, prompted by legislation signed after the president's death, researchers examined the first community volunteer for the Framingham Heart Study. The volunteer was one of 5,209 mostly white women and men who participated in physicals, lab samples and questionnaires, and who agreed to return every two years. About two-thirds of adults in the town took part.</p> <p>Since then, the FHS, now a joint project of Boston University and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, has taken in three generations of ever more diverse, and unpaid, participants. The study launched offshoots in 1994 and 2003 to include more races and ethnicities. That's 15,447 people of varying ages and backgrounds who are part of the science looking into the human genome, the brain and countless other high-tech side trips into the human body and the roots of disease.</p> <p>\"Every part of the body that can be measured, imaged or assessed, we've done so over the last 70 years,\" said Dr. Vasan S. Ramachandran, principal investigator and director of the study for Boston University. \"It's a remarkable human experiment. It's with humility I say that. It's unbelievable, and to be part of it is a gift, a privilege and an honor.\"</p> <p>Today, about one in three deaths in the United States are attributed to cardiovascular disease, about 2,300 people each day. And about 92.1 million adults are living with some sort of heart disease or after-effects of stroke. </p> <p>Framingham popularized the idea of cardiovascular risk factors, the conditions or behaviors that increase the chances of having a heart attack or stroke. FHS researchers published work homing in on those factors, such as high blood pressure, physical inactivity and excess weight. The study refined the idea of \"good\" and \"bad\" cholesterol. And as early as 1960, it pinned smoking as one of the culprits for heart disease.</p> <p>But the work continues to branch out from the heart to the brain, and even to the molecular level, adapting to the demands of science, said Ramachandran, who was hired as a Framingham researcher fresh out of cardiology training 25 years ago. \"When science has made something possible, we are there to leverage it in the study.\"</p> <p>Dr. Daniel Levy also was a young cardiology resident when he first visited Framingham to work on a research project. They hired him, and he said he felt like \"a kid in a candy store\" with all the work being done at the time in the 1980s on cardiovascular disease prevention. And now, as FHS director for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, he still sounds that way.</p> <p>\"When I started here 34 years ago, I couldn't have imagined I'd be doing some of the things I'm doing now,\" he said. \"We've gone beyond the heart to far-reaching programs in stroke and Alzheimer's to epigenetics, how environment changes how our genes work, to the next generation of risk factors and to understand the molecular basis of disease.\"</p> <p>As of August, FHS data has spawned 3,698 published studies in medical, peer-reviewed journals. The study has huge repositories of data, from cell lines and gene sequences to scanned images of the heart, brain, bone and liver. Researchers have conducted whole genome sequencing on about 4,000 people. Its brain research program already has received 230 brains from participants who have died, with 572 more participants signed up to donate theirs.</p> <p>Judie Saltonstall is one of them. She's a second-generation participant who moved to Arizona 29 years ago and still faithfully logs on to her computer every three months to answer questionnaires and memory quizzes. The 75-year-old is part of a contingent of FHS participants living all over the country who travel back to Framingham whenever needed for exams and tests. She reels off a list: retina photographs, bone density tests, and MRIs of the brain, heart and abdomen.</p> <p>\"It's kind of exciting to do,\" said Saltonstall, a mother of four and a former teacher. \"It's important for me personally, but also for them to know what's going on with me and to learn from that, whatever good it does.\" </p> <p>It's something John Stefanini, who still lives in Framingham, understands. He and his four older brothers all are part of the FHS. It's a source of pride, even if he sometimes gets puzzled reactions.</p> <p>\"The reaction sometimes is almost disbelief that you would allow someone to poke and prod and test you in such an invasive and transparent way,\" said the 54-year-old lawyer and former state representative. \"Why would you do that? You lose a day's work, or you have to sleep with wires attached to you for a few days, or you have to collect bodily fluids. But you do it with great pride because you are contributing to the health of the world. That's something we take very seriously.\" </p>",

The new report finds that white Americans will continue to comprise the majority of Alzheimer's cases, simply due to their sheer numbers. But minorities will be hit especially hard.</p><p>Among people 65 and older, blacks currently have the highest prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia at 13.8 percent, the CDC said. That's followed by Hispanics (12.2 percent), and whites (10.3 percent).</p><p>By 2060, the CDC researchers estimated that 3.2 million Hispanics and 2.2 million black Americans will be afflicted with Alzheimer's or a related dementia.</p>  <p>One reason for the increase in U.S. Alzheimer's cases could be inroads made against other diseases of aging. As people are able to live longer with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or diabetes, their odds for developing a dementia in old age rises, the CDC explained.</p><p>All of this means more Americans will also become caregivers for loved ones with dementia.

The team looked for trends in sexual activity, use of birth control and exposure to sexual violence.</p><p>Their findings revealed a dramatic drop in the number of sexually active teens.</p><p>The study showed that 40 percent of U.S. high school students reported that they ever had sex in 2017.

The proportion of students who identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual who faced this sexual violence was also nearly three times as high as heterosexual teens.</p><p>\"Consent is a critical component of sex education, not only to prevent sexual violence, but to promote healthy communication and development of fulfilling relationships,\" said Jesseca Boyer, a Guttmacher policy expert. \"All young people need and have the right to information, education, skills and services to support their sexual and reproductive health and well-being.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics provides more on <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/adolescent-sexual-health/Pages/Reproductive-Health.aspx\" target=\"_new\"> adolescent sexual health</a>.</p>",

And that could be a first step toward understanding the ways in which various environmental exposures affect human health, Glatt suggested.</p><p>\"That's what we believe,\" agreed senior researcher Michael Snyder, chair of genetics at Stanford University School of Medicine, in California.</p><p>\"Health is totally dependent on genes and environment,\" Snyder said. But it's clear that genes explain only a portion of a person's vulnerability to various diseases, he added.</p><p>There is still a huge amount to be learned about the effects of environmental exposures, Snyder said.</p><p>As an initial step, his team gathered detailed information from 14 people who wore matchbook-sized monitors on their arms for anywhere from a week to a month. Snyder, himself, wore the device for two years.</p><p>The devices contained filters that captured particulate matter from the surrounding air. Those samples were brought back to the lab for genetic analyses and chemical \"profiling.\"</p><p>In general, Snyder's team found, people's exposomes were diverse in the types of micro-organisms and chemicals they contained -- although the chemical DEET, an insect repellent, was ubiquitous.</p><p>\"It was everywhere, which kind of surprised me,\" Snyder said.</p><p>Otherwise, the makeup of the exposome seemed to depend on factors like weather, travel, pets and household chemicals, for instance.</p><p>Snyder said his own home exposures turned out to be \"very fungal, rather than bacterial.\"</p><p>He connects that to the use of \"green\" paint in his house. The paint lacks a substance called pyridine, which seems to keep fungus levels down. Snyder also discovered he was exposed to eucalyptus in the early spring -- which, he said, offers some clues to the culprit behind his seasonal allergies.</p><p>Several known carcinogens turned up in most of the chemical samples, according to the researchers. However, they only know the chemicals were present -- and not the amount of exposure.</p><p>If the idea of carrying around a cloud of bacteria, fungi and chemicals makes you cringe, Glatt made this point: Many of those exposures would be harmless or even beneficial.</p><p>It's known, for instance, that while some bacteria make people sick, many are \"good\" and necessary for human health.</p><p>Snyder agreed. For the most part, no one knows yet which components of the exposome are \"good\" and which are not, he said. And that may vary from one person to another, he added.</p><p>Complicating matters, a person's exposome is not static. It is \"dynamic,\" Snyder said, and constantly shifting over a lifetime.</p><p>That will make it challenging to study the ways in which the exposome affects human health, Snyder said. \"But I also think it can be done,\" he added.</p><p>He said his team plans to study larger groups of people in more-diverse environments. They also want to simplify the technology used in the study so that one day, people might be able to use the devices themselves, to track their own exposures.</p><p>The findings were published online Sept. 20 in <i>Cell.</i></p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/exposome/default.html\" target=\"_new\">human exposome</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Sept. 21, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The nightly dinner battles many parents have with picky toddlers can be exhausting. Now, research suggests that either pressuring or rewarding kids to eat healthier may backfire.</p><p>\"These practices can reinforce fussy eating, increase preferences for unhealthy foods, and lead to excessive weight gain,\" study author Holly Harris, from the Centre for Children's Health Research at Queensland University of Technology in Australia, said in a statement.</p><p>One U.S. pediatrician agreed.</p><p>\"Parents who address picky eating either with coercion or bribes may be setting the child up for problems down the road,\" said Dr. Michael Grosso. He's chair of pediatrics at Northwell Health Huntington Hospital in New York.</p><p>In the study, the Australian scientists followed more than 200 mothers and fathers. Their kids were between the ages of 2 and 5, and the families came from a poor area of Queensland.</p><p>Parents answered questions about themselves, their children, their children's eating habits, how they responded to their child's eating patterns, and whether or not they were worried about how their child ate.</p><p>Mothers and fathers seemed to agree on whether or not a child was a fussy eater. But mothers worried more about their child's eating behavior, and they were more distressed by crying, tantrums and gagging.</p><p>The researchers suspect the mother's extra concern may be why mothers were more likely to try to bribe or pressure a child into eating. Dads also tried to pressure their kids into eating. But the researchers said it wasn't due to concern about the child's fussy eating. Instead, the researchers believe fathers may be simply trying to shorten eating struggles.</p><p>So what can parents do to ease those mealtime showdowns?</p><p>Grosso and psychologist Judy Malinowski weighed in, and both agreed it's very important for parents to understand what's normal for their child's development.</p><p>\"Children go through numerous stages of development, and part of that involves a changing sense of taste. What they liked last week, they might not like this week, and it can be because of the texture, color or smell of a food,\" Malinowski explained. She's from Ascension Eastwood Behavioral Health in Novi, Mich.</p><p>Grosso said the biggest problem he sees with eating is that parents think children are eating too little food. But young children don't need a lot of food. </p><p>\"Most children will self-regulate their food intake appropriately,\" he said, adding that he often reassures parents by showing them their child is right where he or she should be on growth charts. </p><p>The next big issue, Grosso said, is power struggles. \"Toddlers are all about establishing their own sphere of autonomy, and of the few things toddlers can control is what they eat. If parents try to be too restrictive, kids will react,\" he said. </p><p>Both experts said the key is to offer choices. Grosso suggested only offering healthy choices, because \"given the choice between healthy and unhealthy, kids will eat candy bars before carrots.\"</p><p>He also recommended that children get age-appropriate servings of milk. \"Kids do need calcium and vitamin D, but they shouldn't get most of their calories from one source,\" Grosso said.</p><p>Malinowski advised involving kids in cooking meals when possible. She also suggested giving choices, such as, \"Do you want this food or that one?\" or \"Do you want a little or a lot?\"</p><p>Praise kids for trying new foods and for eating what was on their plate, Malinowski said. \"But don't punish or bribe for anything around food. This sets up the idea that one food is better than the other,\" she said.</p><p>And the good news is that most kids outgrow the fussy-about-food stage, or at least their pickiness tends to lessen as they get older, Grosso said. </p><p>The findings were published recently in the <i>Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Read more about helping a picky eater from the <a href=\"https://childmind.org/article/how-to-help-kids-who-are-picky-eaters/\" target=\"_new\">Child Mind Institute</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 7, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Despite years of attention to the problem, U.S. hospitals have made little headway in preventing severe cases of bedsores among older Americans, a new study shows.</p><p>Researchers found that across hospitals in three states, the rate of bedsores among Medicare patients dropped by 40 percent between 2009 and 2014.</p><p>However, the picture looked less positive after the researchers did more digging. Nearly all of the decline was in early stage bedsores -- not the deep, severe wounds that can last for years.</p><p>Plus, the researchers said, it's hard to know how much of the decrease in early stage bedsores is \"real.\" The figures come from Medicare billing data -- which may not reflect the actual incidence of bedsores among hospital patients.</p><p>\"We're hoping it's a true decrease, but we can't actually tell,\" said senior researcher Dr. Jennifer Meddings, an associate professor at the University of Michigan Medical School.</p><p>The problem is, the overall rates of bedsores in the billing records were very low -- much lower than what Meddings' team found using a different data source.</p><p>That source, based on information from patients' medical charts, suggests that billing records captured only about 1 in 20 bedsores that Medicare patients actually suffered.</p><p>Bedsores -- known medically as pressure ulcers, or pressure injuries -- are caused by staying in one position for too long. They can affect people who are bedridden, use a wheelchair, or otherwise have difficulty moving.</p><p>Early stage bedsores may appear as red patches on the skin, or a wound that looks like a cut or blister. Advanced-stage injuries are large and deep, affecting tissue under the skin.</p><p>Pressure injuries are painful and can lead to serious, life-threatening infections, explained Janet Cuddigan, vice president of the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel. The panel is a nonprofit dedicated to preventing the injuries.</p><p>When the wounds are deep, they are also slow to heal, and leave people vulnerable to developing pressure injuries again, said Cuddigan, who was not involved in the study.</p><p>She said she was not surprised by the findings, because they echo what some previous research has shown.</p><p>But this study confirms the pattern in a broader population, Cuddigan noted. \"This heightens our awareness that more needs to be done to prevent pressure injuries,\" she said.</p><p>Hospitals have been trying, Cuddigan pointed out. One way, she said, is through \"early mobilization\" of patients, even in the intensive care unit.</p><p>Other measures include regularly cleaning and moisturizing patients' skin and providing enough protein, vitamins and minerals to keep the skin healthy.</p><p>And it's not only bed surfaces that can cause pressure injuries, Cuddigan explained. Tubes and other medical equipment can be culprits.</p><p>Meddings made the same point. If a patient needs an oxygen mask, for example, it can cause a pressure ulcer on the delicate skin behind the ear.</p><p>\"So every day, we need to check behind the ear,\" Meddings said.</p><p>In some cases, prevention is particularly tough. For example, Cuddigan said, a severely ill patient might have a drop in blood pressure each time staff members try a change in position.</p><p>And moving patients is not as simple as it might sound, Meddings said. It might require a whole \"repositioning team\" if a patient is quite heavy, for instance. Plus, there's skill and knowledge involved, Meddings noted. Patients are not simply \"turned,\" but repositioned in specific ways to limit their bedsore risk.</p><p>Family members can do a lot to help, however, Meddings said.</p><p>\"Ask questions,\" she advised. \"If there's any piece of plastic attached to the patient, you can ask, 'Is that still needed?' You can say, 'When I was helping him put on his sock today, I noticed a red spot on his heel.' \"</p><p>Meddings also recommended talking not only to your family member's doctor, but to the nursing staff, too.</p><p>\"They really are considered our skin care experts,\" she said.</p><p>Cuddigan agreed that families should feel free to speak up. \"We want you to be part of the team with us,\" she said.</p><p>The findings are in the November issue of <i>Health Affairs</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Library of Medicine has more on <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/pressuresores.html\" target=\"_new\">bedsores</a>.</p>",

Within 4.5 years, about 28 percent of the patients developed dementia.</p> <p>Researchers considered several factors for the progression and found that higher pulse wave velocity, which measures the elasticity of arteries, was a likely culprit. Arteries carrying oxygenated blood from the heart into the body can become stiff and lose elasticity with age, and the issue can be exacerbated when the vessels have plaque buildup.</p> <p>\"The identification of potential preventive strategies is crucial at early stages,\" said clinical pharmacist Laure Rouch, the study's lead author and a postdoctoral fellow at Universit&eacute; Descartes in Paris. \"Identifying (mild cognitive impairment) patients at higher risk of dementia using non-invasive techniques such as pulse wave velocity is a very interesting finding and also means that arterial stiffness may be a therapeutic target to delay or prevent the onset of dementia.\"</p> <p>In addition to pulse wave velocity to measure arterial stiffness, the study also looked at the thickness of the inner layers of the carotid artery to detect the buildup of fatty plaque. None of the other variables was associated with incidence of dementia.</p> <p>Rouch said pulse wave velocity appears to be a unique vascular biomarker that identifies patients with mild cognitive impairment who are at higher risk for dementia. But she stressed that needs to be confirmed by future studies.</p> <p>Arterial stiffness could expose the brain's blood vessel system to fluctuations in pressure and flow that cause tiny injuries, according to the study. Blood vessel stiffness has been related to atherosclerosis, or fatty buildup along artery walls. It's also been linked to arteriosclerosis, the thickening of blood vessels that can restrict blood flow and lead to stroke.</p> <p>About 48 million people worldwide live with dementia, a figure predicted to nearly double every two decades until 2050.</p> <p>Most people think of dementia as one condition and vascular disease as a separate one when there's actually \"tremendous overlap and interplay\" between the two, said Dr. Karen Furie, the neurology chair at the Alpert Medical School of Brown University.</p> <p>Furie, who wasn't involved in the new study, said the research provides a robust premise and conveys a compelling message.</p> <p>\"Controlling things like blood pressure and preventing vascular disease may not only prevent stroke and heart attack, it could also help prevent dementia,\" she said. \"It's very important for people to realize that there is that relationship, and what they do to keep their heart and brain healthy  may prevent or (slow) the development of dementia.\"</p> <p>The study should remind people how important it is to lower risk factors that are controllable, such as maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly and ditching cigarettes.</p> <p>When many people think of the aftermath of a stroke, a potential consequence of untreated risk factors, \"you picture the older person who is paralyzed and not necessarily the person who can move all their limbs but has dementia,\" said Furie, who chairs the AHA's stroke council. \"But in fact, that may be one of the manifestations of this interplay between vascular disease and other forms of dementia.\"</p> <p> Furie said that while scientists don't have a way to treat neurodegenerative illnesses yet, the diseases can be slowed down by controlling risk factors. And done well enough, it could be the closest thing to a cure, she said.</p> <p>\"It's amongst the possibilities, particularly if you intervene early enough, before damage is done. You could potentially have a significant effect in modifying the disease.\"</p>",

Once the eye is infected, it causes the the cornea to become painful and inflamed due to this cyst-forming microorganism.</p><p>For one in every four of people infected, the disease results in a loss of most of their vision or blindness and they face prolonged treatment, the research team said.</p><p>While rare, outbreaks have also occurred in the United States, one ophthalmologist said.</p><p>\"There have been a few outbreaks in the U.S., most notably from improper disinfection of contact lenses,\" said Dr. Jules Winokur, who practices at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He wasn't involved in the new study.</p><p>\"In clinical practice, we see cases of acanthamoeba on a regular basis, \" he said. \"Most often, these cases present in patients wearing contact lenses who have been exposed to contaminated water, which could be from swimming pools, water parks or even showers at home.\"</p><p>\"The treatment of acanthamoeba can be prolonged and difficult,\" Winokur explained. \"Toxic medications and even corneal transplantation may be necessary treatments.\"</p><p>The British study was led by Dr. John Dart, from University College London's Institute of Ophthalmology. His team collected data on patients seen from 1985 to 2016 at Moorfields Eye Hospital.</p><p>They found an increase in cases of the disease from the eight to 10 a year seen in 2000 -2003, to 36 to 65 cases per year more recently.</p><p>Overall, 25 percent of those affected required corneal transplants to treat the disease or restore vision, the researchers said. </p><p>Dart's team also conducted a second study, this time in people who wore reusable contact lenses daily. The study compared those 63 diagnosed with  Acanthamoeba keratitis with 213 people who went to the eye hospital for any other reason.</p><p>Dart's group found that the risk of developing the disease was more than three times greater among people with poor contact lens hygiene. This means people who didn't always wash and dry their hands before handling their lenses, or those who used a now discontinued disinfectant product containing Oxipol.</p><p>In addition, people who wore their contacts in swimming pools or hot tubs were also at risk, as were those who showered or washed their face while wearing their lenses, the study found.</p><p>\"People who wear reusable contact lenses need to make sure they thoroughly wash and dry their hands before handling contact lenses, and avoid wearing them while swimming, face washing or bathing,\" Dart said.</p><p>\"Daily disposable lenses, which eliminate the need for contact lens cases or solutions, may be safer and we are currently analyzing our data to establish the risk factors for these,\" he added in a university news release.</p><p>Dart stressed that \"this infection is still quite rare, usually affecting fewer than 3 in 100,000 contact lens users per year in South East England, but it's largely preventable.\"</p><p>\"This increase in cases highlights the need for contact lens users to be aware of the risks,\" he added. </p><p>Dr. Matthew Gorski is an ophthalmologist at Northwell Health in Great Neck, N.Y. He agreed that proper contact lens hygiene could prevent most cases of Acanthamoeba.</p><p>According to Gorski, that includes:</p><ul><li>Washing your hands with soap and water before handling contacts.</li><li>Properly disinfecting, cleaning and storing your contacts, including never using tap water to clean contacts.</li><li>Removing contacts from your eyes before water exposures such as swimming, showering or bathing.</li> <li>Removing contacts immediately and seeing your eye doctor if you have any eye pain, sensitivity to light, red eye or change in vision.</li></ul><p>The study was published Sept. 21 in the <i>British Journal of Ophthalmology</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on Acanthamoeba keratitis, visit the <a href=\"https://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/eye-and-vision-problems/glossary-of-eye-and-vision-conditions/acanthamoeba\" target=\"_new\">American Optometric Association</a>.</p>",

The nonprofit urges consumers to be extra cautious before deciding to use ground beef tucked away in the freezer.</p><p>\"<i>E. coli</i> O26 is quite serious. You don't want to risk your health, or your family's,\" said James Rogers, director of food safety testing and research at Consumer Reports.</p><p>The government last week said Cargill Meat Solutions was recalling more than 132,600 pounds of ground beef produced at its Fort Morgan, Colo., plant because of possible E. coli contamination. </p><p><i>E. coli</i> bacteria can cause severe cramps, bloody diarrhea and vomiting. At least one person has died as a result of the recent outbreak and 17 more were sickened, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). Those sickened were in Florida, but the USDA advised that the recall involves meat that was shipped to other states.</p><p>Consumer Reports notes that much of the recalled meat, which had a use-by date of July 11, was sold in bulk to retailers who might have repackaged it for sale.</p><p>\"If the meat has been repackaged, the brands and codes provided on the FSIS list so far won't help consumers figure out if their purchase was part of this ground beef recall,\" Rogers said in a news release from the nonprofit group.</p><p>\"This, combined with the fact that people may take the meat out of its packaging and wrap it themselves before they freeze it, means many consumers may have no way of knowing if they purchased affected Cargill beef, or know the use-by date that was on the original package,\" he added.</p><p>The USDA posted a list of meat brands involved in the recall, including the Excel, Fire River Farms, Our Certified, and Sterling Silver labels.

Both are designed to deliver a corrective electric shock to the heart if a heartbeat rhythm goes out of whack.</p><p>While implanted defibrillators are known to save lives in the months and years following a heart attack, \"prior clinical trials have found that implantable cardioverter defibrillators did not lead to a survival benefit in the first 40 to 90 days\" right after a heart attack, said cardiologist Dr. Gregg Fonarow.</p><p>So guidelines prohibit implantation during the first 40 days after a heart attack, or during the first 90 days among patients who've had bypass surgery or stent implantation, explained Fonarow. He is director of the Ahmanson-UCLA Cardiomyopathy Center and co-director of the UCLA Preventative Cardiology Program in Los Angeles, and was not involved with the new study.</p><p>According to Fonarow, despite a lack of solid proof, many cardiologists have operated under the assumption that wearable defibrillators could pick up the lifesaving slack in those early days after a heart attack.</p><p>Why? On the one hand, cardiac arrest is a big public health concern. Cardiac arrest, which is not the same as a heart attack, is caused when the heart's electrical system malfunctions and the heart stops beating properly.  The American Heart Association estimates it affects more than 350,000 non-hospitalized Americans every year.</p><p>What's more, Fonarow stressed that the risk of cardiac arrest is \"relatively high\" in the immediate aftermath of a heart attack, particularly among those diagnosed with low \"ejection fraction\" (EF). In such patients, the heart's left ventricle pumps out a relatively low amount of blood with every heartbeat.</p><p>In the new study, all 2,300 patients had an EF of 35 percent or less within a week after being discharged from the hospital following a heart attack. (A normal EF hovers between 50 to 65 percent).</p><p>About two-thirds of the study patients were trained to use a \"LifeVest,\" a combination harness/vest that is worn underneath clothing. One-third received usual care.</p><p>On average, the vest group wore the device 14 hours a day for up to three months. However, usage steadily decreased from 18 hours a day on average to 12 hours a day, and by the study's end half the patients had stopped wearing it altogether.</p><p>Perhaps in part for that reason, the study team ultimately found no evidence that the vest helped to lower sudden cardiac death risk.</p><p>Fonarow described the study as \"well conducted,\" and suggested that it's a good example of the fact that \"many therapeutic strategies that seem plausible don't actually work out the way intended when subjected to a rigorous clinical trial.\"</p><p>Dr. Richard Page, who co-authored an editorial accompanying the study, suggested the findings are far from clear-cut.</p><p>Page noted, for example, that the study team also found that vest wearers saw their overall risk of dying from any cause drop by 35 percent.</p><p>Exactly why remains unclear. And Page acknowledged that while he \"would like to say that the device played a role, we can't, because it's not the endpoint that the study was designed to test.\"</p><p>But Page said he would still prescribe the vest \"for a patient who I feel is at high risk and is highly motivated to wear the device.\"</p><p>\"This study was a heroic effort. But there is no question that these kinds of patients are at high risk for sudden cardiac arrest and death,\" said Page. He is a clinical cardiac electrophysiologist and chair of the department of medicine at the University of Wisconsin's School of Medicine and Public Health.</p><p> \"And during this window of time after a heart attack, they are not eligible for an implantable device,\" he continued.</p><p>\"But this wearable device -- if you're actually wearing it -- likely offers a very good chance, and almost your only chance, for saving your life if you have a cardiac arrest,\" Page said.</p><p>The study was led by Dr. Jeffrey Olgin, who is chief of the division of cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco Center for the Prevention of Sudden Death.</p><p> Olgin and his colleagues published their findings in the Sept. 27 issue of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>. The research was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and LifeVest manufacturer Zoll Medical Corp.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on sudden cardiac arrest at the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cardiac-arrest\" target=\"_new\">American Heart Association</a>.</p>",

Ditto a parent seeking antibiotics for their child for chronic Lyme disease.</p><p>None of these treatments are proven to be of value, experts note.</p><p>But this new study illustrates a grave \"potential for misinformation and 'fake news' to spread,\" said Dr. Vineet Arora, a professor of medicine at the University of Chicago. </p><p>The report warns that many Americans use crowdfunding websites such as GoFundMe to perform end-runs around their doctors and insurance carriers in order to finance medical procedures that can be untested, ineffective and/or potentially dangerous.</p><p>\"It's a huge trend,\" said study lead author Dr. Ford Vox, a brain injury specialist at the Shepherd Center in Atlanta. </p><p>Vox and his colleagues reviewed medical postings from November 2015 until December 2017 on four American and Canadian crowdfunding sites: GoFundMe, YouCaring, CrowdRise and FundRazr.</p><p>They zeroed in on campaigns for five medically unsupported \"treatments\" in eight countries: homeopathy or naturopathy for cancer; hyperbaric (atmospherically pressurized) oxygen therapy for brain trauma; stem cell therapy for brain injuries; stem cell therapy for spinal cord injuries, and long-term antibiotic therapy for chronic Lyme disease.</p><p>Despite a lack of evidence supporting these therapies, researchers found that more than 1,000 campaigns raised more than $6.7 million. Ninety-eight percent of the postings appeared on GoFundMe, and the cumulative goal was to raise more than $27 million.</p><p>At the high end, nearly 500 funding pleas for homeopathic/naturopathic cancer treatments took in more than $3.4 million, the researchers found.</p><p>Nearly 200 campaigns for hyperbaric oxygen therapy raised about $785,000. Requests to fund stem cell therapy for brain and spinal cord injuries drew more than $1.8 million. And controversial long-term antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease raised about $689,000.</p><p>Those numbers, said Vox, reflect the rise of an \"explosive\" and unregulated market for accessing treatments that are neither safe nor effective. \"Ultimately, there is a lot of legal but bad medicine out there,\" he added.</p><p>Assuming the money went where it was promised to go, donors \"indirectly contributed millions of dollars to practitioners to deliver dubious, possibly unsafe care,\" Vox and his research team wrote in a letter published Oct. 23 in <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>.</p><p>Vox and others agree there are plenty of legitimate medical crowdfunding requests.</p><p>But medical crowdfunding \"erodes public trust in the medical and scientific enterprise, if it brings attention to treatments that are not supported by science,\" said Arora, who wasn't involved in the study. \"This erosion can also make it harder to advance trust when treatments are [effective].\"</p><p>Vox said crowdfunding sites \"need to recognize the potential downside and accept a certain level of responsibility.\" He suggested they work with the academic and bioethics community to determine how best to move forward.</p><p>Arora added that \"the public has a right to unbiased and accurate information about both the proven risk and benefit of medical treatments.\" Ensuring that, she said, may require new regulations. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Cancer Institute talks about <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient\" target=\"_new\">complementary cancer treatments</a>.</p>",

For this study, the researchers investigated this association among children.</p><p>The study showed the children who had rapid weight gain as infants, which is a strong risk factor for childhood obesity, had fewer groups of bacteria or less diversity in their mouth bacteria. These children also had a higher ratio of <i>Firmicutes</i> to <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, two of the most common bacteria groups of the human microbiota.</p><p>\"A healthy person usually has a lot of different bacteria within their gut microbiota,\" said the study's first author, Sarah Craig, a postdoctoral scholar in biology. </p><p>\"This high diversity helps protect against inflammation or harmful bacteria. &hellip; There's also a certain balance of these two common bacteria groups, <i>Firmicutes</i> and <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, that tends to work best under normal healthy conditions, and disruptions to that balance could lead to dysregulation in digestion,\" she said.</p><p>The study authors did not identify a link between weight gain and this reduced diversity or high <i>Firmicutes</i> to <i>Bacteroidetes</i> ratio.

On average, the kids in the study spent 3.6 hours a day engaged in screen time.</p><p>The study couldn't prove cause-and-effect, but the more individual recommendations a child met, the better their ability to think and reason. That's what the researchers found when they compared guideline adherence against performance on brain exercises (\"cognition\").</p><p>\"For every additional recommendation met, children had significantly better cognition compared to those who did not meet any of the guidelines,\" Walsh said.</p><p>Kids who met the sleep and screen time guidelines appeared to have the best intellects, followed by the kids who met just the screen time guidelines, the findings showed.</p><p>Too much screen time could be wrecking kids' ability to focus, especially if they are switching between apps on a device or between different screens at the same time, Walsh suggested.</p><p>\"One leading hypothesis is that a lot of time on screens is spent multitasking, using multiple apps or devices at once,\" Walsh said. \"This can interfere with a child's ability to focus and sustain interest on a task. It can be impairing the building blocks for good cognition.\"</p><p>Sleep also is incredibly important to brain development, since that's when the brain reorganizes itself and grows, Walsh added. Exercise has been shown to increase blood flow to the brain and oxygenation of brain tissues, and increases the connectivity of networks in the brain.</p><p>Too much screen time could lead to a \"cascade\" effect where kids don't get enough sleep and then are less active during the day.</p><p>\"You can see how this collectively would have an impact on brain health,\" Walsh said.</p><p>The findings were published online Sept. 26 in <i>The Lancet: Child &amp; Adolescent Health</i> journal.</p><p> According to Dr. Shawna Newman, an attending psychiatrist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, the study \"clearly demonstrates the specific benefit of exercise for children, in addition to that of good sleep hygiene and the limitation of screen time contributing positively to cognitive development.\" Newman was not involved with the new study.</p><p>\"The article provides an understanding of how vital exercise is to pediatric brain development, and the potentially detrimental effects of reduced sleep and increased screen time for cognition,\" Newman said.</p><p>What should parents do? Walsh advised setting firm rules regarding the use of screens, including how long children are using the screens, the kinds of apps they are using and how many screens they are using at once.</p><p>Concerned parents also should preview games or apps before letting their child play, seek out more interactive options that engage the child's mind, and use parental controls to block or filter content and limit screen time.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics has more about <a href=\" https://healthychildren.org/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Where-We-Stand-TV-Viewing-Time.aspx \" target=\"_new\">screen time and children</a>.</p>",

She's a lecturer in the University of Limerick's psychology department.</p><p>The study findings echo previous research \"showing that individuals with visible physical distinctions, which are viewed negatively by society, can experience impaired psychological and physical well-being as a result,\" O'Donnell said in a university news release. </p><p>Acne isn't only a teen problem. The skin condition affects almost 13 percent of adults aged 59 and older and more than 1 in 10 kids between ages 5 and 13, the study authors said.</p><p>For the new report, the authors surveyed almost 300 people with the blackheads and pimples that characterize acne. They found that those who perceived the most acne-related stigma had more psychological distress and physical symptoms such as trouble sleeping, headaches and digestive issues.</p><p>Women reported more severe symptoms than men. And acne severity correlated with the quality-of-life issues and mental distress, though only an association rather than a cause-and-effect link was seen.</p><p>Facebook and other social media may indirectly reinforce perceptions of acne stigma, the researchers said.</p><p>\"Like many physical attributes that are stigmatized, acne is not well represented in popular culture, advertising or social media. This can lead people with acne to feel that they are 'not normal' and therefore negatively viewed by others,\" said study co-author Jamie Davern, a Ph.D. student also at the University of Limerick. </p><p>Davern said the findings are important for health care providers and anyone who has a loved one dealing with acne.</p><p>\"The wider negative impacts some acne sufferers experience are very challenging and require sensitivity and support,\" he added.</p><p>The study was published online Sept. 28 in <i>PLOS ONE</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The American Academy of Dermatology provides more on <a href=\"https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/acne-and-rosacea/acne\" target=\"_new\">acne</a>.</p>",

While fat in general has gotten a bad rap, some types of fat -- particularly plant-based fats -- are good for you in moderation.</p><p>Good-for-you fats:</p><ul><li>Olive, flaxseed oil and other plant-based oils.</li><li>Fatty fish.</li><li>Avocados.</li><li>Walnuts, other nuts and their oils.</li><li>Sunflower seeds and other seeds.</li></ul><p>Based on their chemical composition, plant-based fats are either monounsaturated or polyunsaturated, though many have a combination. Both types have health benefits. Olive oil is the top choice among the mostly monounsaturated fats, which also include canola and peanut oils, avocados, walnuts, and many other nuts and seeds. Flaxseed in particular is exceptionally rich in ALA, or alpha-linolenic acid, one of the omega-3 fatty acids. Grind the seeds before you eat them or use flaxseed oil to get the most nutrients.</p><p>Plant foods high in polyunsaturated fats include soybean and sunflower oils, and some nuts and seeds. But one of the healthiest sources of polyunsaturated fats are fatty fish because they contain the other important omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The best fatty fish are salmon, tuna, trout, mackerel, sardines and herring.</p><p>The fats to limit are saturated fat, found mostly in animal foods such as red meat, full-fat dairy, butter and lard.</p><p>The fats to completely avoid are trans fats, which are oils that undergo a process that extends their shelf life, but makes them extremely unhealthy. Manufacturers are in the process of removing them from foods, but check labels because the deadline to fully comply with this U.S. Food and Drug Administration ruling has been extended to 2020.</p><p>Fats do help you feel more satisfied, but they're also the most calorie-dense foods, so watch quantities, even when choosing the best sources.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart Association has detailed information on <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/HealthyEating/Nutrition/FATS-The-Good-the-Bad-and-the-Ugly-Infographic_UCM_468968_SubHomePage.jsp\" target=\"_new\">good and bad fats</a>, including ones to completely avoid.</p>",

Many said they'd refused or delayed treatments, failed to pay non-medical bills, or been contacted by collection agencies.</p><p>It all amounts to a \"financial toxicity,\" experts said, that could take a toll on patients' mental and physical well-being.</p><p>The costs of cancer go well beyond paying for medical care, said lead researcher Stephanie Wheeler, an associate professor of health policy and management at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.</p><p>Patients may have to travel long distances to their cancer center, pay for lodging or arrange for child care or care for elderly parents -- to name just a few expenses.</p><p>So, having health insurance is no guaranteed protection, Wheeler said.</p><p>In fact, the study found, breast cancer patients with health insurance actually reported more distress over their financial situation, versus those who were uninsured.</p><p>It's a surprising finding, Wheeler said. But she speculated on some potential explanations: For one, women with insurance may have been taken off-guard by high out-of-pocket expenses. And some may have had to spend down assets they'd built over years -- which can be \"very distressing,\" Wheeler pointed out.</p><p>Caitlin Donovan is a spokesperson for the Patient Advocate Foundation, a nonprofit that offers financial assistance and other services to people with serious chronic diseases.</p><p>It was no surprise to her that many women in this study faced financial woes.</p><p>\"To us, there's no difference between the 'direct' and 'indirect' costs of medical care,\" Donovan said. \"We've found that one of the biggest [financial] concerns people have is transportation.\"</p><p>If you live far from your treatment center, the cost of gas alone can be daunting, Donovan noted.</p><p>And even if you live in a city and take the subway, she added, there's the time off from work -- whether it's for the patient or family member -- and possibly additional expenses like child care.</p><p>The strain of dealing with all of that can take a toll on patients, both emotionally and physically, Donovan said.</p><p>\"That's why they call it financial toxicity,\" she said. \"It affects the 'whole' person.\"</p><p>The findings are based on 1,054 U.S. women with metastatic breast cancer -- which means the disease has spread to distant sites in the body, like the bones or brain. Close to half had been living with it for one to two years, while around one-quarter were at the two- to five-year mark.</p><p>Overall, the study found, nearly 70 percent of the patients said they were worried about financial problems related to their cancer.</p><p>Many women -- 35 percent -- lacked health insurance, and nearly all of those women said they had delayed or refused a treatment. That was true for 41 percent of insured women, the findings showed.</p><p>It's not clear what type of care the women put off, or when, Wheeler noted.</p><p>\"But it's absolutely concerning,\" she said.</p><p>In addition, about three-quarters of uninsured women said they'd been contacted by a collections agency, while 40 percent had skipped paying non-medical bills.</p><p>Insured patients also reported those problems, albeit at lower rates. And when it came to the emotional strain from financial worries, they tended to be faring worse than uninsured women.</p><p>It's a striking finding, Donovan said. And she agreed that insured patients may be less prepared, mentally, for the financial toll.</p><p>\"Anecdotally,\" Donovan said, \"patients are often surprised by what their insurance plan doesn't cover.\"</p><p>The picture is not all bleak, Wheeler stressed. \"The good news,\" she said, \"is that there are financial resources -- at hospitals, in the community, and even from industry.\"</p><p>She cited the Patient Advocate Foundation as one national group. She suggested, though, that patients \"start at the place where they're receiving care.\"</p><p>Large cancer centers will generally have more financial assistance programs, Wheeler noted. But smaller hospitals usually have resources, too -- such as social workers who can help families navigate the financial side of care.</p><p>Wheeler did, however, point to a shortcoming: \"Many of the resources that exist are limited to uninsured patients. And clearly, patients with insurance need help, too.\"</p><p>Donovan agreed, and said the \"disjointed\" nature of the U.S. health care system sets up roadblocks. Many patients either have difficulty accessing the financial services that are out there -- or are not aware of them at all, she added.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Patient Advocate Foundation has a guide for women with <a href=\"https://www.patientadvocate.org/wp-content/uploads/Metastatic-Breast-Cancer-Guide.pdf\" target=\"_new\">metastatic breast cancer</a>.</p>",

This new understanding has changed our whole outlook on how to take care of patients with congenital heart disease,\" said the statement's lead author, Dr. Mary Ella Pierpont, a pediatrician and a professor of pediatric genetics and metabolism at the University of Minnesota.</p> <p>The summary covers a broad spectrum of topics and new advancements in genetic conditions, including a phenomenon called copy number variation, or CNV, when the number of copies of a particular gene varies from one person to the next. The statement also offers updated information on new molecular testing techniques and how they apply to congenital heart disease and other congenital anomalies or syndromes.</p> <p>\"If doctors know the cause of their patients' conditions, they can make a better long-term medical management plan, provide better care and the promise of a healthier life,\" Pierpont said. \"For example, certain types of congenital heart disease could be associated with rhythm disturbances, and knowing the gene abnormality can help the physician evaluate for the possibility of arrhythmia.\"</p> <p>New genetic testing techniques help pinpoint a prognosis for congenital heart disease, assess risks for the patient's children and other close relatives, and alert doctors to associated medical conditions that may need attention.</p> <p>The statement helps doctors \"think about things in the context of a family, not just the individual in front of you,\" said Dr. Carolyn Ho, medical director of the Cardiovascular Genetics Center at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School.</p> <p>Ho, who was not involved in writing the report, said \"the types of genetic anomalies that underlie congenital heart disease are incredibly diverse, and this statement does a good job of saying which types of genetic testing you can have, based on the broad range of genetic changes and how it can lead to congenital heart disease.\"</p> <p>The statement discusses new prenatal gene testing techniques that have emerged in recent years to better inform doctors and parents who may be concerned about the increased risks for women who have congenital heart disease and for their baby.</p> <p>\"The statement is not dogmatic, saying you <i>must </i>or <i>should </i>be tested -- but you do need to be educated so you can make a good decision for yourself and your family,\" said Dr. Wendy K. Chung, a statement co-author and a clinical and molecular geneticist and professor of pediatrics at Columbia University. \"The statement is saying it's important for parents to see professionals who are experienced in the prenatal setting, such as a genetic counselor and/or geneticist.\"</p> <p>Newer prenatal tests include non-invasive cell-free DNA testing, which is conducted by blood sample from the mother, and chromosomal microarray, or CMA, testing. Testing is done after an amniocentesis, a procedure which can carry a small risk of miscarriage. The statement says CMA tests are warranted, either prenatally or postnatally, for people with certain types of congenital heart disease.</p> <p>\"The cell-free DNA test can detect some things associated with congenital heart disease, but the chromosome microarray test gives you more information,\" said Chung. \"Looking forward, there are much more powerful technologies that we currently use prenatally in research studies. There's a lot coming down the pike very quickly.\"</p> <p>Pierpont agreed, but she expressed concern that key research on congenital heart defects may go unfunded, including studies on how non-cardiac diseases might be associated with congenital heart disease.</p> <p>\"Adult heart disease and cholesterol gets the bulk of the funding in heart disease, but we also need improved research for congenital heart disease,\" she said. \"This paper shows there's a lot happening. It's a very important area for future research.\"</p>",

However, makers of generics don't have to repeat the clinical trials done on the originals.</p><p>To be approved by the FDA, a generic must show \"bioequivalence\" -- there can't be a significant difference from the brand in the rate and amount of absorption of the drug when given in the same dose under similar experimental conditions.</p><p>Here are the FDA's generic drug rules:</p><ul><li>The drug must contain the same active ingredients as the brand-name drug.</li><li>The drug must be identical in strength, dosage, form and route of administration.</li><li>It must be absorbed into the bloodstream at a similar rate and over the same period of time.</li><li>It must be manufactured under the same strict standards of brand-name drugs.</li><li>The drug must meet the same requirements for identity, strength, purity and quality.</li></ul><p>Though rare, sometimes a generic fails to perform like the brand. In 2012 some patients didn't get the same results from generics of a common antidepressant and had new or worse side effects. Testing ultimately found they were not bioequivalent to the brand. Soon after, to increase safety, the FDA began a $20 million program for widespread testing of generics made here and in other countries that sell here, notably India.</p><p>In January 2016, a study on the value of generics concluded that, by and large, there are no significant differences in outcomes between generics and brands.</p><p>Some physicians simply prefer to prescribe newer medications, which can be very expensive, even when an older generic has been shown to work. That can mean more out-of-pocket costs for you. And that can be a problem because when a drug is more affordable, patients are more likely to stick to their treatment plan. So, if you're on brand-name medications and cost is an issue, talk to your doctor about alternatives.</p> <p>The FDA has also made it easier to monitor the safety of available drugs -- generic and brand -- through the MedWatch page on its website.</p> <p><b>More information</b></p><p>The FDA's consumer page will help you understand more about <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm340343.htm\" target=\"_new\">generic drugs</a>, and it includes a link to MedWatch.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Sept. 21, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Have you ever left a doctor's appointment with only a vague idea of what was said? You're not alone: A new survey finds many Americans, and their doctors, are turning to recordings for help.</p><p>Researchers found that almost 30 percent of the doctors they surveyed had ever recorded a visit for a patient's use. And about 19 percent of U.S. adults said they'd done so themselves -- usually after asking the doctor's permission.</p><p>Since smartphones are ubiquitous, it's easier than ever to make such recordings, said study author Paul Barr, an assistant professor at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice.</p><p>But it hasn't been clear how often patients are doing it -- or whether many doctors are OK with it, said Barr.</p><p>Based on his team's findings, most patients and doctors are at least interested in the idea.</p><p>\"Clinicians are open to doing this,\" Barr said. \"I hope this helps raise awareness that this is an option for patients, if they're interested.\"</p><p>Research shows that people forget up to 80 percent of the information they hear during an average medical visit. But, Barr said, research also shows that recordings can help make up for fuzzy memories.</p><p>Dr. Colleen Silva specializes in treating breast cancer at the University of Texas Medical Branch, in Galveston. For nearly a decade, the center has offered cancer patients recorders to tape their visits if they wish.</p><p>A cancer diagnosis itself can be devastating, Silva pointed out. On top of that, patients may need to digest an avalanche of information on their treatment options.</p><p>\"They can be so overwhelmed, they just shut down,\" Silva said. That's where recorded visits can make a big difference.</p><p>\"Anecdotally, I can tell you that patients really appreciate having these. I've had many who say this helps them recall information,\" Silva said.</p><p>Plus, she added, patients can share the recordings with family members who weren't able to accompany them to the appointment.</p><p>Barr agreed that the ability to share information with family can be one of the big advantages of recording doctor visits.</p><p>The findings, published recently in the <i>Journal of Medical Internet Research</i>, are based on two surveys: One focused on 456 U.S. doctors in various specialties; the other included a nationally representative sample of 524 adults.</p><p>Just over 28 percent of doctors said they'd ever recorded a visit for a patient to use. It was most common among specialists who, like Silva, treat cancer: Almost half of oncologists said they'd recorded appointments.</p><p>The practice was also common among doctors who specialized in physical rehabilitation -- with 42 percent saying they'd ever recorded visits.</p><p>As with cancer care, Barr said, that makes sense, because physical rehab may involve a lot of information to absorb. Studies have found, for example, that patients often prefer to have a video of their provider demonstrating exercises, versus getting written instructions only.</p><p>Of the respondents from the general public, almost one-fifth said they'd ever recorded a medical appointment. Most had done it with their doctor's permission -- but nearly 3 percent said they'd secretly recorded a visit.</p><p>Why they'd chosen the covert route is unclear.</p><p>But if some patients are worried about asking their doctor to record a visit, this survey offers some good news, according to Barr. While about 70 percent had never recorded an appointment, half of those doctors said they'd be willing.</p><p>\"I think patients should absolutely feel they have the power to ask, if they want to,\" Silva said.</p><p>A recording might not be needed if you're visiting the doctor for an infection, Silva noted.</p><p>\"But I could see this being useful any time a patient has a chronic medical condition that requires more complex, long-term management,\" she said.</p><p>Barr agreed, and said that older adults -- who often have multiple health conditions and difficulty remembering medical information -- may find recordings especially helpful.</p><p>Some doctors in the survey did bring up one concern: The possibility that recorded discussions could end up being used against them in a lawsuit.</p><p>Silva said that in her center's experience, that theoretical downside has not become a reality.</p><p>\"So far, in nine-plus years, this has not come up as a problem,\" she said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has tips on <a href=\"https://www.ahrq.gov/patients-consumers/patient-involvement/ask-your-doctor/index.html\" target=\"_new\">talking to your doctor</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Oct. 4, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- In 2016, almost 174 Americans died each day due to drug overdoses -- and roughly two-thirds of those deaths were caused by opioid drugs. The statistics are startling and make the problem seem hopeless.</p> <p>But is it?</p><p>Beating drug addiction -- whether it's opioids (such as OxyContin), methamphetamine or something else -- is definitely a challenge and an ongoing process. Recovery often doesn't occur with just one attempt. People often relapse one or more times during the process, according to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse.</p><p>But it is possible to recover from even the most serious of addictions.</p><p>Just ask Katelyn and Jeffrey Hoglund -- a Cincinnati-area couple. Before they met, they were both so far gone into addiction that their daily lives revolved solely around getting the next fix.</p><p>Today, they're celebrating five years drug-free and their first wedding anniversary (they met in recovery). Both have good jobs and they just purchased a new house to give their five dogs more room to roam.</p><p><b>Paths to addiction</b></p><p>Their journeys weren't without trouble though. \"I had zero belief that I could be anything but a dope fiend when I was using,\" Katelyn said.</p><p>Both Katelyn and Jeffery were somewhat surprised by how easy it was to get addicted.</p><p>For Katelyn, it started with a party where she took some opioid pain pills. She liked the high and started using them more and more. She said she was naive and didn't realize that the pills were addictive.</p><p>\"I thought, 'These are made in a lab. They must be OK.' But one day I woke up feeling really sick,\" she said. \"I didn't know it at the time, but I was dope sick. Later that day, I got some pain pills, and I vividly remember that I felt better, and then I thought, 'Uh-oh.' \"</p><p>But she still kept using, and said it was probably only a month or two before she knew she was addicted. The real turning point was when she crossed from pain pills to using a needle to inject heroin. \"At that point, any semblance of my life was shattered,\" she said.</p><p>Katelyn said she used for probably five years, and during that time was arrested a few times, including for stealing a large sum of money from her parents.</p><p> \"Everything finally started to catch up on me,\" she said. \"I would wake up in the morning and be angry that I had woken up, that I hadn't overdosed. I knew I couldn't continue to live that way.\"</p> <p> Katelyn turned herself in and was given a chance to go to an inpatient treatment center instead of jail.</p><p>Jeffrey's story is similar. He was very close to his parents, especially his Dad. In 2001, he found out his Dad had pancreatic cancer. He was devastated. A friend said to him, \"Buddy, you don't have to feel this.\" That was the first night he ever tried hard drugs.</p><p>\"The drugs brought me everything I didn't know I was looking for, and from that point until 2013 -- 12 years -- it didn't matter what drugs I could get as long as I didn't have to feel,\" Jeffrey said.</p><p>Like Katelyn, he said any semblance of his former life vanished once he crossed the line into injecting drugs. Jeffrey also was arrested and entered drug rehab multiple times before he finally took recovery seriously.</p><p><b>Support key to recovery</b></p><p>What made the last visit to rehab the one that stuck?</p><p>Jeffrey said he's not entirely sure, but thinks the weekly visits from his mother helped. His mother encouraged him and said she saw something changing in him. \"I always thought I would die a junkie. But seeing myself through her eyes allowed me to see myself as something better,\" he said.</p><p>Marjorie Clifton, executive director of the Center for Safe Internet Pharmacies, said what many people don't understand about opioid addiction in particular, is that the drugs rewire your brain.</p><p>\"People addicted to opioids aren't looking for the high; they're trying to avoid the dope sickness. They get so sick when coming off the high that they will do anything to keep from feeling it, and it's something you cannot understand unless you've been through it,\" Clifton said.</p><p>Fred Muench, CEO of the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids, and himself a recovering addict, said the stigma surrounding addiction is a huge problem.</p><p>\"I've heard people say, 'Why should you resuscitate addicts who've overdosed?' because people believe addiction is a choice. But addiction is a disease, and however that disease gets triggered, we need to stop blaming the individual and seeing addiction as a moral failure. Addiction is the only disease we treat with jail,\" he said.</p><p>Muench said if you have insurance, you'll likely have treatment options. Success rates between inpatient and outpatient treatment aren't drastically different, but whatever your choice, be sure to research the treatment center and make sure its marketing isn't making wild promises. Family members can help with this research if they want to be involved, he suggested.</p><p>People without insurance must rely on state and local government programs. These programs often have waiting lists, he noted.</p><p>Muench also encourages family members to not give up, even if your loved one has tried over and over again to get off drugs. But, he added, it's important to set boundaries, and support doesn't necessarily mean giving someone money.</p><p>\"Understand that you reaching out to help can change someone's life. When I couldn't give myself hope, others around me who could see I wasn't a bad person, just someone struggling, gave me hope. It can get you from feeling suicidal to getting into treatment,\" Muench said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about safe medicine use and what treatment options are available for people addicted to drugs from <a href=\"https://medicinesafe.org/\" target=\"_new\">MedicineSafe</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 3, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Among the most significant advances in surgery has been the development of laparoscopic -- or minimally invasive -- procedures.</p><p>These are new ways to perform many standard operations, with a few, very small incisions, often barely a half-inch long, compared to traditional so-called open surgery with one incision several inches long.</p><p>To perform an operation this way, the surgeon inserts a laparoscope, a thin tube with a tiny camera at the tip, through one incision to visualize the area of concern. Images from the camera are seen on a monitor. The surgeon uses them to guide tiny surgical instruments through other incisions and do the operation.</p><p>A few small incisions can mean less pain, fewer visible scars and potentially faster healing. You can often go home the same day and get back to many normal activities sooner. There's also less chance of internal scar tissue, called adhesions, which can be painful.</p><p>For the surgeon, one advantage is that the images are magnified on the monitor, making it easier to see organs and tissues. However, laparoscopic procedures can take longer than open surgery, and longer time under anesthesia may increase the risk of complications, such as internal bleeding or infection, which might take days or weeks to appear.</p><p>While many complex surgeries must be done the traditional way, minimally invasive surgery is now routine for many health issues.</p><p>Laparoscopic surgery is available for:</p><ul><li>Many gynecological and urinary procedures.</li> <li>Hernia repair.</li><li>Gallbladder removal.</li><li>Some infertility treatments.</li><li>Bariatric, prostate and some colon surgeries.</li></ul><p>Always check the credentials of your surgeon. While many learned this technique as part of their medical education, more senior surgeons must go for special training to learn it. Always ask how many times the surgeon has performed the procedure you need before you agree to it.

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Oct. 4, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Researchers have proposed a unique study in humans to reduce the early onset of atherosclerosis, the buildup of the artery-clogging plaque that can lead to heart attacks and strokes.</p> <p>The report, published Oct. 4 in the <i>Journal of the American Heart Association</i>, reviews a host of previous research and proposes a new clinical trial to reduce apolipoprotein B, also called apo B lipoproteins, in young and middle-age adults. Over the past few decades, research has pointed to this group of blood proteins, which includes LDL, or \"bad cholesterol,\" as the main culprit in the beginnings of atherosclerosis.</p> <p>\"Lowering them may have a big impact on making atherosclerosis go away,\" said study lead author Dr. Jennifer Robinson, a professor of epidemiology and director of the Prevention Intervention Center at the University of Iowa. \"If this works, you could completely eliminate heart attacks and strokes within a generation, because you can't have a heart attack or stroke unless you have atherosclerosis.\"</p> <p>The proposed trial, CURing Early ATHEROsclerosis, or CURE ATHERO, would set out to determine if atherosclerosis in high-risk adults aged 25 to 55 might be reversed by using medicines called statins and PCSK9 inhibitors over the course of three years.</p> <p>\"The idea is to get the cholesterol very low for a short period of time, let all the early cholesterol buildup dissolve, and let the arteries heal,\" Robinson said, adding that this approach has worked well in animal studies. \"Then patients might need to be retreated every decade or two if the atherosclerosis begins to develop again.\"</p> <p>Lipoproteins are tiny, complex particles that transport fat and cholesterol through the blood. \"There are a lot of different types of lipoproteins, but the ones that have apolipoprotein B on them are the ones that cause atherosclerosis,\" said Dr. John Wilkins, a cardiologist and assistant professor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.</p> <p>Wilkins, who wasn't involved in the report, called the proposal a \"very compelling idea\" that might show whether older adults can avoid heart attacks and strokes by making sure they have low LDL and apo B levels earlier in their lives.</p> <p>\"It's a very important question that we really need to answer, because we have therapies now to lower apo B lipoproteins and LDL cholesterol,\" said Wilkins, who has conducted research on apo B lipoproteins.</p><p>\"We know that people who have low LDL cholesterol for genetic reasons have a very low risk of having cardiovascular events, so if we can replicate one of these genetic states and get people's LDL cholesterol really low in early adulthood, perhaps these people won't have downstream complications like heart attack and stroke,\" Wilkins added.</p> <p>The proposed trial would face certain challenges, including reluctance among young, seemingly healthy adults to take medication, Wilkins said. Another possible obstacle is the length of the study.</p> <p>\"Atherosclerosis develops over decades. It's going to be very difficult to conclusively link a treatment strategy in people in their 30s or 40s to a reduction in risk 20 or 30 years later,\" Wilkins said. \"You would have to treat people and then follow them for 20 to 30 years, and that type of study design just isn't practical.\"</p> <p>Doctors aren't currently advised to test patients' apo B levels, Robinson said, because routine LDL cholesterol tests and other measures already give doctors information to assess cardiovascular risk.</p> <p>But she said she hopes the proposed trial will show that lowering apo B levels early in life will help people who are genetically inclined to have high cholesterol, as well as those with health problems caused by a poor diet, obesity and lack of exercise.</p> <p>\"People should do as much as they can with lifestyle, but it's really hard to have a healthy lifestyle in modern society,\" Robinson said.</p> <p>A clinical trial could pave the way for a new generation of therapies to fight heart attacks and strokes, she said.</p> <p>\"Once you know what causes something, you can come up with a hammer for it and eliminate it. We're not the first ones to think of this idea. This would be the culminating study of decades of research by thousands of people. But I'm excited about this, and I think it's really time to pursue this hypothesis.\"</p>",

She is a staff scientist with the Fogarty International Center at the U.S. National Institutes of Health.</p><p>\"If we could strengthen surveillance in these cities, we would have an earlier window on the severity of epidemics, and we may use those data to help predict epidemics on a regional or national scale,\" Viboud explained.</p><p>Such an edge could be critical given that U.S. health officials announced just last week that influenza killed an estimated 80,000 Americans during last winter's flu season, making it the deadliest season in more than four decades.</p><p>A particularly virulent flu strain, H3N2, rampaged across the country during the 2017-2018 season, causing a record number of deaths and hospitalizations, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.</p><p>Compounding the problem, flu vaccination rates also dipped last year, officials noted, leaving more people vulnerable to the virus and making flu shots even more imperative this flu season.</p><p>In general, the flu season spikes during the winter due to lower humidity, Dalziel said.</p><p>\"Flu spreads from person to person by virus-bearing moisture droplets that an infected person exhales or coughs or sneezes out. This creates what you can think of as a moving cloud of risk around an infected individual,\" Dalziel said.</p><p>During the winter, humidity decreases \"and this causes the virus to remain viable in the air for longer, which effectively expands that cloud of risk,\" he explained.</p><p>But in larger cities where people are packed in tight, the dry winter weather matters less, the researchers found.</p><p>\"If an infected person is sitting right beside you, it matters less what the specific humidity is,\" Dalziel said. \"It helps the virus find a host even when climactic conditions are not at their most favorable.\"</p><p>Dalziel and his colleagues combined six years of data on influenza cases with census data showing where people live and work in 603 different cities across the United States.</p><p>The investigators found that in large metropolitan areas, flu cases are more spread out, including early and late in the season when weather is not the best for transmission. New York City and Miami are examples of cities that have a more prolonged flu season, the study authors said.</p><p>On the other hand, smaller cities tend to have short flu seasons tightly grouped around the usual peak in winter. Atlanta and Nashville are examples of this, where the flu hits during in a more concentrated period.</p><p>The researchers noted that the risk for getting the flu remains the same in all cities.</p><p> Viboud said, \"This does not show that some cities are safer than others for flu. Rather, it shows the relative difference in the timing of cases.\"</p><p>The data show that public health officials need to take their metropolitan area's structure into account when planning for each flu season, the researchers suggested.</p><p>Larger cities with a longer flu season will need to prepare for cases to start appearing earlier, for example.</p><p>\"In contrast,\" Viboud said, \"in smaller cities a more intense outbreak may overload the health care system, making it particularly challenging to respond to epidemics.\"</p><p>The study shows how the rise of megacities could make a new flu pandemic more likely, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore. He was not involved with the new study.</p><p>\"Influenza in large cities behaves differently with longer transmission chains, prolonged seasons and less vulnerability to changes in humidity versus smaller cities,\" Adalja said. </p><p>\"This study underscores the need for pandemic preparedness efforts to be heightened in the biggest cities of the world, for they may be the major drivers of the looming influenza pandemic,\" he added.</p><p>The study was published Oct. 5 in the journal <i>Science</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">influenza</a>.</p>",

Trying to compensate, the heart begins to pump inefficiently and in consequence becomes enlarged and misshapen.</p><p>At the same time, these changes begin to wear on the mitral valve, which guides blood flow from the heart's left atrium into its left ventricle. This can cause a \"back up\" of blood within the heart, worsening the heart's inefficiency and exacerbating heart failure.</p><p>While medicines can slow heart failure, its progress is relentless and there's been little else to offer patients. Almost 2 million Americans have severe heart failure, which seriously limits daily activity.</p><p>But the new study, funded by the device's maker, Abbot, offers renewed hope. Doctors used the device, called MitraClip, to join two wayward flaps of the damaged mitral valve together in the middle. This appeared to restore regular function to the valve, researchers said.</p><p>The trial included 614 patients with severe heart failure in the United States and Canada.  They were randomly assigned to receive either the MitraClip plus standard therapy or standard therapy alone.</p><p>Among those half of patients who didn't get the device, 151 were hospitalized for heart failure over the next two years, and 61 died.  That's compared to just 92 hospitalizations for patients who received the clip, 28 of whom died.</p><p>\"This is a game changer. This is massive,\" Dr. Matthew Williams, who directs the heart valve program at NYU Langone Health in New York City, told the <i>Times</i>.</p><p>The hospital had a few patients in the study, which was published Sunday in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> and presented simultaneously at a European heart meeting.</p><p>The MitraClip costs about $30,000, the <i>Times</i> said. Experts believe that, if approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the device would probably be covered by Medicare.</p><p>In the surgery, doctors guide the tiny device to the heart via a blood vessel in the groin.</p><p>Dr. Gregg Stone, of Columbia University Medical Center and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, led the new trial. He believes the device might also prove a less invasive alternative for people who aren't candidates for mitral valve replacement surgeries.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Sept. 24, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Following years of decline, fatal car accidents involving teen drivers have accelerated in the United States, a leading group of U.S. pediatricians warns.</p><p>New research also reveals that teenage drivers are more likely to be involved in a serious or deadly crash than any other age group, notes the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p><p>The group has updated its 2006 policy statement on teen driving to focus on new threats facing inexperienced drivers.</p><p>\"We all know how easy it is to become distracted while driving, particularly in the age of texting and technology,\" said statement author Dr. Elizabeth Alderman. \"Parents can set a powerful example with their own driving habits, from using a seatbelt regularly to avoiding cellphone use or speeding.\"</p><p>The new policy statement followed a review of 2014-2016 national accident data.</p><p>\"Every state has some form of graduated driver's licensing regulations, which have helped improve safety by limiting the number of passengers or restricting night-time driving,\" said statement co-author Dr. Brian Johnston. \"Yet more can be done. One step that could make a difference is for communities to more consistently enforce laws on seat belts and use of cellphones while driving,\" he said in an academy news release.</p><p>In 2015 alone, nearly 1,900 teen drivers died in car crashes -- a 9 percent jump from the year before. And nearly 200,000 young drivers were hurt in car accidents.</p><p>Inexperience plays a role in these accidents. The AAP found the risk of a car accident or close call is four times higher for teenagers who got their license within 18 months. Driving too fast, driving with other teens in the car, being distracted and driving under the influence of alcohol, drug or medications are other risks, the experts warned.</p><p>Teens who drive their friends around are more likely to get into an accident, the academy noted.</p><p>The driving risks may be even higher for teens with medical concerns, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), concussions or sleep apnea. These health issues could affect their ability to drive safely, the group says.</p><p>There are steps doctors can take to boost the safety of teens behind the wheel. The AAP recommends the following:</p><ul><li>Remind teens to always wear a seat belt. And inform young people about the risks of driving while under the influence of alcohol, drugs or medication. </li><li>Urge parents to go beyond state requirements for drivers' training: Exceed the minimum amount of supervised driving with your teens and practice in a variety of conditions and situations. </li><li>Encourage using safe alternative routes to school to shorten driving time.  </li><li>Support later school start times so that teens are well-rested.  </li><li>Study the effectiveness of graduated driver's licensing rules, to determine if these laws should be expanded to include new drivers who are 18 or 19. </li></ul> <p>\"For many teenagers, driving is an important rite of passage,\" Alderman said. \"We want to help them navigate this new privilege safely. Families can ask their pediatrician to share in a conversation with their new driver to set expectations and decrease risks.\"</p><p>The statement was published online Sept. 24 in <i>Pediatrics</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides more information on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/teen_drivers/index.html\" target=\"_new\"> teen drivers</a>.</p>",

More specifically, they assessed how a mother's habit influenced the age at which her children started using the drug. They also considered the children's behavior, mental abilities, social environment and family income.</p><p>The report showed that roughly 67 percent of the children and 35 percent of the mothers reported being marijuana users.</p><p>The researchers also found the kids whose mothers used the drug were more likely to try it themselves at a median age of 16.

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Oct. 25, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- A new gene therapy might help improve motor symptoms in people with Parkinson's disease who aren't responding to other therapies, an early study has found. </p><p>\"This is not a cure of Parkinson's disease,\" said James Beck, chief scientific officer of the Parkinson's Foundation. \"This is a potentially good treatment for symptom control. It provides an additional way of providing dopamine to the brain, but it doesn't stop the progression of Parkinson's disease.\"</p><p>The new treatment uses a virus to deliver gene therapy to a targeted area of the brain. The gene therapy affects an enzyme called AADC. This enzyme transforms levodopa into dopamine in the brain. </p><p>Cells that make the neurotransmitter dopamine -- a chemical messenger in the brain -- die off in Parkinson's disease, according to the U.S. National Institute on Aging. A loss of dopamine causes the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as tremor and slow movements. </p><p>Standard treatments attempt to replace the lost dopamine. For example, one current medication is levodopa, but the cells that transform levodopa into dopamine have to be functioning for this treatment to work. As the dopamine-producing cells die off, it becomes harder and harder for the brain to respond to medications like this, Beck explained.</p><p>And, that's where the new gene treatment may help. </p><p>Led by Dr. Chadwick Christine, at the University of California, San Francisco, researchers used MRI scanning to locate the right area of the brain. Then they infused the new gene therapy into a targeted area of the brain called the putamen. The study team chose this area because these brain cells aren't destroyed by Parkinson's disease. </p><p>The phase 1 trial included 15 people who were no longer responding to other Parkinson's treatments. They all received one infusion of the gene therapy -- known as VY-AADC. </p><p>After the treatment, researchers followed the patients' health for up to 36 months and found that the treatment was well-tolerated. The most serious side effects -- a blood clot and an irregular heart rhythm caused by the blood clot -- were related to the surgery used to deliver the treatment, and not the treatment itself, the researchers said. </p><p>The therapy also showed a meaningful improvement in the time people spent without movement symptoms each day. And the effect appeared to be lasting, with some of the patients followed for as long as three years. </p><p>Dr. Alessandro Di Rocco, director of the Movement Disorders Program at Northwell Health in Great Neck, N.Y., reviewed the findings. </p><p>\"This study seems to be a step forward in perfecting the [gene therapy] vector and they were able to give it safely,\" he said.</p><p> Di Rocco added that the decrease in symptoms \"is a real effect.\"</p><p>But, like Beck, he cautioned that this is an early study with only a small number of people in the trial. Di Rocco also noted that the trial wasn't \"blinded,\" so it's possible there was a placebo effect for some. </p><p>Both Di Rocco and Beck also expressed concern about the possible cost of such therapy. </p><p>The University of California, San Francisco, and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center researchers aren't the only team working on gene therapy for Parkinson's symptoms. A group of British researchers is actively recruiting Parkinson's patients to take part in a gene therapy trial that's also aimed at increasing the availability of dopamine in the brain. </p><p>Their trial will look at up to 30 patients receiving treatment in London or Paris. For this study, researchers are targeting a part of the brain called the striatum. </p><p>Results of the American study were presented Sunday at the American Neurological Association meeting, in Atlanta. Findings presented at meetings should be viewed as preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about Parkinson's disease treatments from the <a href=\"https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/treatment\" target=\"_new\">Parkinson's Foundation</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 7, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Untreatable, antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea has become a chilling prospect in the United States, raising concerns that people might someday have to live with the sexually transmitted bacteria.</p><p>But now there's reason for hope. A newly developed antibiotic pill has proven effective against gonorrhea in early clinical trials.</p><p>Zoliflodacin proved effective in treating gonorrhea infections of the urinary and genital tracts and rectum, researchers say.</p><p>\"Gonorrhea has become resistant to every antibiotic that has ever been used for it, so right now we're down to our last class of antibiotics that can be used,\" said lead researcher Dr. Stephanie Taylor, an infectious disease specialist in New Orleans.</p><p>\"This is very, very encouraging as a potential new antibiotic,\" added Taylor, medical director of the Louisiana State University-CrescentCare Sexual Health Center. </p><p>The study results are published in the Nov. 8 <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p>Gonorrhea rates have risen dramatically in recent years in the United States.</p><p>More than 555,600 cases were reported nationally in 2017, an 18 percent increase over the previous year, said Dr. Susan Blank, assistant commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. And between 2013 and 2017, gonorrhea rates increased 67 percent.</p><p>\"It's a swiftly increasing infection in the United States,\" Blank said. \"We are seeing some pretty steep increases. It's rarely fatal, but it can really profoundly impact quality of life.\"</p><p>Currently, people with gonorrhea are treated with an injection of ceftriaxone, the only antibiotic still effective against the bacteria, Taylor said.</p><p>\"We know gonorrhea has an incredible capacity to develop resistance to antibiotics,\" Blank said. \"Where we are right now, untreatable gonorrhea is a real possibility.\"</p><p>Untreated gonorrhea can cause sterility in people, as well as pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and destructive arthritis, Blank said. Babies exposed to gonorrhea by infected mothers can be stricken blind.</p><p>\"Gonorrhea also facilitates significantly the transmission of HIV infection between sex partners,\" said Blank, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new trial results.</p><p>In this clinical trial with 141 participants, zoliflodacin proved nearly as effective as ceftriaxone. </p><p>Zoliflodacin cured 96 percent of genital and urinary tract infections and 100 percent of rectal infections, compared with ceftriaxone's 100 percent effectiveness, the researchers reported.</p><p>The new antibiotic struggled against gonorrhea infections in the throat, with a higher 3-gram dose clearing only 82 percent of infections compared with 100 percent effectiveness from ceftriaxone.</p><p>\"That historically has been the way gonorrhea of the throat has reacted,\" Taylor said. \"It's always been difficult to treat.\"</p><p>The most common side effects were gastrointestinal, and none required patients to go off the new medication, Taylor said. One limitation was that only 12 women participated in the trial.</p><p>This was the second of three clinical trials needed for U.S. approval of zoliflodacin. Phase 3 trials will start next year, Taylor said. If those trials go well, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would have data on hand to evaluate and approve the antibiotic by 2020. The agency already has granted the antibiotic a \"fast track\" designation.</p><p>Although the development of zoliflodacin is encouraging, more antibiotics must be developed to keep countering gonorrhea and other antibiotic-resistant germs, Taylor and Blank said.</p><p>\"Even if this antibiotic were perfect, we know gonorrhea will outsmart it,\" Blank said. \"We need things in the back pocket. We don't know how quickly it will outsmart it.\"</p><p>Doctors and public health officials also must continue efforts to detect and treat gonorrhea, Blank said. People who are sexually active need to use condoms to prevent transmission of gonorrhea, which disproportionately spreads among blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans, she noted.</p><p>\"Controlling gonorrhea in a population requires a whole bunch of connected activities,\" Blank said.</p><p>The clinical trial was funded in part by zoliflodacin's co-developer Entasis Therapeutics, a spinoff of AstraZeneca.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/STDFact-gonorrhea.htm\" target=\"_new\">gonorrhea</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 20, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The advent of the e-cigarette appears to have spurred a huge drop in tobacco smoking rates among teenagers and young adults, a new study claims.</p> <p>Previous research has argued that vaping could prove to be a gateway drug for smoking, by getting youngsters hooked on nicotine and used to the physical actions associated with smoking.</p><p>Instead, smoking among teens dropped off dramatically after e-cigarette use became more widespread in 2013, said lead researcher David Levy. He is a professor with the Georgetown University Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, in Washington, D.C.</p><p>\"The rate of decline in cigarette use tripled,\" said Levy.</p><p>The new findings come days after U.S. regulators pledged to strengthen policies that prevent the sale of flavored vaping products to minors.</p><p>\"I will not allow a generation of children to become addicted to nicotine through e-cigarettes,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a U.S. Food and Drug Administration statement. \"We won't let this pool of kids, a pool of future potential smokers, of future disease and death, to continue to build.\"</p><p>For the new study, Levy and his colleagues analyzed responses to five different national surveys that track tobacco use.</p><p>The surveys showed that, prior to 2013, cigarette smoking was gradually declining among young people between the ages of 15 and 25, the researchers reported.</p><p>But after 2013, that gradual decline turned into a steep decline. The annual relative reduction in smoking tripled among 10th and 12th graders, the investigators found.</p><p>Why? Levy and his colleagues suggested that, in part, it's because vaping became popular.</p><p>Past 30-day vaping among high school students increased from 1.5 percent in 2011 to 4.5 percent in 2013, and to 13.4 percent in 2014.</p><p>\"When e-cigarette use came in, smoking rates dropped between 25 and 40 percent,\" Levy said. \"Smoking rates in young adults have dropped by almost 50 percent, and most of that [has been] since 2013.\"</p><p>Levy said he's worried that tough e-cigarette regulations could reverse those trends.</p><p>\"My concern is if we have very strict policies on e-cigarettes, it's kind of like throwing out the baby with the bathwater,\" Levy said. \"We might see more smoking.\"</p><p>But Patricia Folan, director of the Northwell Health Center for Tobacco Control in Great Neck, N.Y., said the new report gives vaping too much credit for the decline in tobacco use among young people.</p><p>\"Anti-tobacco media campaigns, increasing taxes on cigarettes, tobacco-free environments, the removal of cigarettes and other tobacco products from some pharmacies and other retail stores, as well as efforts to restrict and reduce point-of-sale advertising have all contributed to a reduction of smoking among teens and adults,\" Folan said.</p><p>Levy agreed that these measures have played a part, but argued that \"of the between 25 and 50 percent drop in smoking rates, maybe 10 percent might be explained by other policies.\"</p><p>In fact, the availability of e-cigarettes might make other anti-smoking efforts more effective, Levy added.</p><p>\"Those other policies probably have become a lot more powerful as a result of e-cigarettes being there as a substitute for cigarettes,\" he said.</p><p>But Folan noted that even if young people are vaping rather than smoking, they're still being exposed to nicotine.</p><p>\"Vaping is often perceived as a healthy alternative for teens and adults,\" she said. \"However, for teens the exposure to nicotine can have an adverse effect on the developing brain and lead to lifelong addiction.\"</p><p>It also shouldn't be assumed that e-cigarettes are harmless, said Dr. Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialist with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. The vapor inhaled by users contains a wide array of chemicals.</p><p>\"This is not a non-toxic thing to do, just because it's not burning paper and burning tobacco,\" Horovitz said. \"There's nothing OK about vaping.\"</p><p>The study was published online Nov. 20 in the journal <i>Tobacco Control</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has more about <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm625884.htm\" target=\"_new\">upcoming e-cigarette regulations</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 21, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- When young children have a bout of \"stomach flu,\" parents often turn to probiotics for help. But two new clinical trials suggest they are wasting their money.</p><p>Researchers found that probiotic formulas showed no benefit for babies and preschoolers with acute gastroenteritis -- a common gut infection that causes diarrhea and vomiting.</p><p>The findings contradict some earlier, smaller trials.</p><p>But researchers said those studies were generally \"poorly done\" and provided only weak evidence that probiotics worked.</p><p>The new trials, performed in Canada and the United States, were much better designed, said Dr. J. Thomas LaMont, a gastroenterologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.</p><p>And the findings might change doctors' minds about suggesting probiotics for gastroenteritis, he said.</p><p>\"Often, trials with negative findings don't get published,\" said LaMont. \"These trials were published because they're expected to have an impact on clinical practice.\"</p><p>LaMont wrote an editorial accompanying the reports, which were published Nov. 22 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p>Probiotic supplements contain live bacteria, the goal being to restore a better balance to intestinal bacteria and boost the immune system.</p><p>Despite the weak evidence, some medical societies do suggest probiotics as an option for kids' gastroenteritis -- partly because the products are considered quite safe.</p><p>So doctors do recommend them, and many parents try the heavily marketed products on their own, said Dr. David Schnadower, who worked on both trials.</p><p>As it stands, there is no way to stop the diarrhea caused by gastroenteritis, said Schnadower, a professor of pediatrics at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. The only treatments are fluids to prevent dehydration and, sometimes, anti-nausea medication.</p><p>\"That's frustrating,\" Schnadower said. \"Parents really want something to make this go away.\"</p><p>But based on the new findings, he said, probiotics are not the answer.</p><p>The U.S. trial tested a pediatric formulation of a probiotic marketed for \"digestive health\" called <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG</i>, or LGG.</p><p>It included 971 children aged 3 months to 4 years who'd been diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis in an emergency room. The researchers randomly assigned them to receive either a five-day course of LGG or a placebo, in addition to standard care.</p><p>In the end, the study found, the probiotic made no difference. Children in both groups had diarrhea for an average of two days, and missed two days in day care.</p><p>Schnadower said his team looked at the findings from different angles -- including whether probiotics had different effects in kids who did or didn't get antibiotics, or whose infections were caused by a virus versus bacteria.</p><p>\"No matter how we looked at it,\" he said, \"probiotics were no better than placebo.\"</p><p>The Canadian study tested a probiotic combination -- <i>L. rhamnosus</i> plus <i>L. helveticus</i> -- in 886 children with acute gastroenteritis. The results were nearly identical to those from the U.S. trial.</p><p>None of that means probiotics are useless, according to LaMont. He pointed to a recent trial in rural India, where researchers gave newborns a probiotic or placebo for the first few days of life. The supplement lowered the babies' risk of lung infections and sepsis -- a severe complication of infection -- in the first two months of life.</p><p>But when it comes to acute gastroenteritis, LaMont said, probiotics may have no effect because kids' symptoms are usually short-lived anyway.</p><p>\"These conditions get better on their own in about 48 hours,\" he said. \"They're self-limiting.\"</p><p>Schnadower suggested that parents stick with some basic measures when a child has diarrhea and vomiting.</p><p>\"Keep your child well-hydrated with fluids,\" he said, \"and wash your hands regularly to lower the risk of spreading the infection.\"</p><p>And while probiotics are generally safe, Schnadower pointed to the cost.</p><p>\"Is it worth spending money on a probiotic that's no better than a placebo?\" he said. \"You could spend it on fruits and vegetables and other nutritious foods instead.\"</p><p>Schnadower did stress that there's great promise in studying the \"microbiome\" -- the trillions of bacteria and other microbes that naturally dwell in the body and may play a key role in our health.</p><p>\"But research into manipulating the microbiome for health is still in its infancy,\" Schnadower said. \"The market for probiotics is huge, and it's growing much faster than the science supporting it.\"</p><p>He cited statistics showing the global market stands at about $37 billion.</p><p>In the United States, LaMont noted, probiotics are not regulated the way drugs are. They are considered supplements and do not have to be proven effective before hitting store shelves.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institutes of Health has more on <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/viral-gastroenteritis\" target=\"_new\">gastroenteritis</a>.</p>",

That's one reason why public health messages fall on deaf ears, researchers say.</p><p>But investigators think they've found a better way. They suggest leaving your ego behind because it might open your mind to healthy activities that your natural defensiveness shuns.</p><p>\"One of the things that gets in the way of people changing their behavior is defensiveness,\" said Emily Falk, senior author of the new study. She's an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania's School for Communication.</p><p>\"When people are reminded that it's better to park the car farther away and get in a few more steps, or to get up and move around at work to lower their risk for heart disease, they often come up with reasons why these suggestions might be relevant for somebody else, but not for them,\" Falk said in a university news release.</p><p>The new study found that people who were prompted to either think about others, or to have spiritual thoughts, were more likely to become more physically active. </p><p>The study included 220 sedentary adults who were overweight or obese. Participants were placed into one of two  so-called \"self-transcendence\" groups, or a \"control\" group. </p><p>One of these groups was asked to think about values bigger than themselves, such as their loved ones or their connection with God or another higher power, while in an MRI machine.</p><p>Another group was asked to make positive wishes for people they knew and for strangers. These included hopes that their friends would be happy or that others would be well.</p><p> Meanwhile, a third group -- the  \"neutral control thoughts\" group --  was instructed to think about their least important values. </p><p>The study participants then saw health messages that urged them to increase physical activity and explained why their current behaviors jeopardized their health.</p><p>In the following month, participants received daily text messages that repeated the experiment in miniature, reminding them of the self-transcendence thoughts, or the neutral control thoughts from the study. All of the participants also wore fitness trackers to monitor their activity.</p><p>Compared with the \"neutral thoughts\"  group, people who completed the self-transcendence tasks were significantly more active in the month that followed, the researchers found.</p><p>In addition, they showed more activity in brain areas involved in reward and positive feelings.</p><p> Lead author Yoona Kang pointed out that \"people often report that self-transcendence is an intrinsically rewarding experience. When you are having concerns for others, these can be rewarding moments.\" Kang is a postdoctoral fellow at the university's  School for Communications. </p><p>People are capable of doing things for their loved ones that they would never do for themselves, she said. \"The idea of self-transcendence -- caring for others beyond one's own self-interest -- is a potentially powerful source of change,\" she added.</p><p>The study was published online Sept. 17 in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on healthy living, visit the <a href=\"https://healthfinder.gov/HealthTopics/Category/everyday-healthy-living\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a>.</p>",

Now, new research suggests that's true for the latest form of the drug, as well.</p><p>Scientists say the protective effect of the newer pills -- which contain lower doses of estrogens and different progestogens -- rose over time and persisted for several years after women stopped taking them.</p><p>\"Based on our results, contemporary combined hormonal contraceptives are still associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer in women of reproductive age,\" conclude a team led byDr Lisa Iversen, a researcher at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.</p><p>The study wasn't able to prove cause-and-effect. However, Iversen's group pointed to prior research that found that women who took the older forms of oral contraceptives tended to have a lower risk for ovarian cancer.</p><p>But would the same benefit apply to newer pills, with different combinations and levels of hormones?</p><p>To find out, the team examined the effects of newer hormonal contraceptives with combined hormones, as well as progestogen-only products, on the risk for ovarian cancer among young women.</p><p>Overall, they tracked data on nearly 1.9 million Danish women between the ages of 15 and 49. The data came from national prescribing and cancer registers compiled between 1995 and 2014.</p><p>The women were divided into three groups: those who never used hormonal birth control pills, those who currently use them or did so recently for up to one year, and former users who took the pills for more than a year.</p><p>The study, published Sept. 26 in the <i>BMJ</i>, showed that 86 percent of the women took combined birth control pills.</p><p>After factoring in the women's age and other variables, the researchers found that ovarian cancer was most prevalent among the women who had never used birth control pills.</p><p>Also, the number of cases of ovarian cancer were dramatically lower among women who had used birth control pills that contained both estrogen and progestogen at some point.</p> <p>A similar protective effect was <i>not</i> found among women who took pills that only contained progestogen.</p><p>Overall, if the Pill does help prevent ovarian cancer, the study authors now estimate that use of the meds prevented 21 percent of ovarian cancers in this group of Danish women.</p><p>One U.S. expert wasn't overly surprised by the findings.</p><p>In prior studies, \"patients who use oral contraceptives for extended periods of time have been found to have significantly lower ovarian cancer risks,\" said Dr. Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician/gynecologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>The new study just reaffirms that potential benefit for newer-generation pills, she said.</p><p>Ovarian cancer is often not detected until it has spread, making it once of the deadliest cancers.  That's why anything that might prevent the disease in the first place is so important, Wu said.</p><p>\"Ovarian cancer has such a delayed time to diagnosis and such poor long-term survival that prevention is essential,\" Wu said. So, \"when counseling patients on birth control options, the reduction in ovarian cancer must be considered,\" she said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services provides more information on <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/opa/pregnancy-prevention/birth-control-methods/birth-control-pills/index.html\" target=\"_new\"> birth control pills</a>.</p>",

Over time the smoke weakens the lungs, forcing the heart to work harder, and more inefficiently, to pump blood through the body. Studies have found that smokers are more likely to die from heart disease than from lung cancer.</p> <p>Researchers in this new study looked at data for 6,842 smokers who had CT scans of their lungs, images that also include detailed pictures of their heart. They measured coronary artery calcium in each scan and found a direct relationship between the level of calcified coronary plaque -- the fatty buildup in arteries often associated with heart disease -- and death from any cause in the subsequent years the patients were monitored.</p> <p>\"We found that those participants who had higher levels of coronary calcification, or plaque in their heart, were more likely to die over the next seven years or so,\" said Dr. Matthew Budoff, lead author of the study and a cardiologist at the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute. Among COPD patients with the highest levels of coronary artery calcium, 24.4 percent died compared with 8.4 percent of those with no calcium buildup.</p> <p>The study could help shed light on the need for people with COPD to pay closer attention to their heart while they take steps to treat their lung illness, said Dr. Irving Kron, a cardiothoracic surgeon and the interim dean at the University of Arizona's College of Medicine-Tucson.</p> <p>\"If you have chronic lung disease from smoking, you have a pretty good chance of having heart disease as well, and that's going to be more lethal to you than the lung disease,\" said Kron, who was not involved in the study.</p> <p>\"We have so much in the way of both prevention and intervention (for heart disease) these days,\" he said, stressing that recognition and acting on that awareness are key. \"As long as you deal with it, you're probably going to be OK. There are terrific therapies now to keep you going forever.\"</p> <p>An estimated 19 million routine chest CT scans are done annually, so adding a cardiovascular screening at the same time could be done \"without additional radiation, cost, or participant burden,\" according to the study.</p> <p>Heavy smokers or COPD patients are \"probably already getting a CT scan,\" Budoff said, but most radiologists don't automatically seek out signs of coronary artery calcium.</p> <p>\"We're trying to increase awareness to say, 'Look, it's already on the picture.' So while they are getting CTs of their lungs, on the scan will be a picture of their heart, so they could get two for the price of one,\" he said.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Sept. 25, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Alice Hinrichs woke up feeling miserable. She was exhausted, nauseated and her left arm hurt.</p> <p>She thought she was sick, so she called her doctor's office for an appointment. Instead, her doctor urged her to go to a hospital in case her symptoms were warnings for a heart attack. There, she was stunned to learn she had several serious health problems: atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension and an enlarged heart.</p> <p>\"I just thought I was sick,\" said Hinrichs, a 56-year-old finance manager from Gladstone, Missouri. \"Even when they told me my heart was out of rhythm, I couldn't sense any difference.\"</p> <p>Her early diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, or AFib, was crucial. Left untreated, the condition marked by an irregular heartbeat increases the risk for stroke by five times. But early detection and treatment can help prevent stroke, said Dr. Patrick T. Ellinor, a cardiologist and director for the Cardiac Arrhythmia Service at Massachusetts General Hospital.</p> <p>\"Unfortunately, some people show up with a stroke and that is when AFib is detected,\" Ellinor said.</p> <p>AFib affects more than 2.7 million Americans. It occurs when the upper chambers of the heart beat irregularly, preventing it from efficiently moving blood to the lower chambers.</p><p>September is Atrial Fibrillation Awareness Month, when health care providers try to make people aware of the condition and the importance of early detection.</p> <p>As for Hinrichs, she was greatly relieved to have her condition detected in July. She had noticed she got tired more easily in recent years.</p> <p>\"I just figured it was because I didn't work out regularly,\" she said.</p> <p>While the most common symptom for AFib is a quivering or fluttering heartbeat, some people have no symptoms. Other symptoms include fatigue, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness and sweating.</p> <p>Risk factors for AFib include high blood pressure, underlying heart disease, family history and binge drinking. Athletes and those with chronic conditions such as thyroid problems, diabetes, or asthma may also have increased risk. The risk of developing AFib increases with age -- affecting about 9 percent of people over age 65. People over 70 are more likely to not have symptoms, Ellinor said.</p> <p>Working to avoid a stroke is important to Hinrichs -- especially considering her husband survived one in 2014.</p> <p>While trying to relocate to the couch to escape his wife's snoring in July 2014, Kurt Hinrichs noticed he couldn't move his right arm and hand. He collapsed as he tried to walk, waking Alice. She called 911 and Kurt was rushed to a nearby stroke center, where he was given clot-busting medication and underwent a procedure to remove the clot.</p> <p>Within 36 hours of his stroke, Kurt had made almost a full recovery. Today, he exercises regularly and tries to maintain a healthy diet and weight to reduce his risk for another stroke. Doctors initially suspected AFib may have triggered his stroke, although an implanted heart monitor has never detected the condition.</p> <p>AFib treatment is typically medication but may include medical procedures to stop the electric signals causing an irregular heart rhythm.</p> <p>Alice Hinrichs underwent a procedure to close an appendage in her left atrium to reduce the risk of clots, in an effort to reduce her need for blood thinners. She takes medication to keep her heart from racing and reduce water retention, and she's working with specialists to treat her other conditions.</p> <p> Hinrichs made changes to her diet to focus on heart health and is trying to work more exercise into her routine.</p> <p>\"I realize now how important it is to be aware of my body and take care of myself,\" she said. \"We're taking things one day at a time and working with doctors to see what's next. This is a lifelong condition, so I know I need to be monitoring what's going on and follow up if anything changes.\"</p>",

But researchers say a new vaccine might prevent half of full-blown illnesses in infected people who receive the shot.</p><p>\"We found that the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis was significantly lower\" for people who got the experimental vaccine, called M72/AS01, than for people who received a \"dummy\" placebo shot, reported a team led by Dr. Olivier Van Der Meeren.</p><p>He's head of clinical research at drug maker GlaxoSmithKline, which funded the study along with pharmaceutical company Aeras. The findings were published online Sept. 25 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p>While largely banished in more-affluent nations, tuberculosis (TB) is still a widespread and often fatal respiratory disease in the developing world.</p><p>In fact, there were over 10.6 million cases of TB globally in 2016, noted Helen Cox and Valerie Mizrahi, of the Wellcome Center for Infectious Diseases Research in Africa in Cape Town, South Africa.

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 10, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- When serious infection gives rise to septic shock, the resulting plunge in blood pressure can cripple kidney function, necessitating immediate dialysis.</p><p>But clinicians know that not all patients need it, because in the first two days after septic shock strikes, a significant number who are treated with antibiotics and fluids alone can experience a \"spontaneous\" recovery without dialysis.</p><p>The problem? Doctors can't figure out which patients will and which won't spontaneously recover. The result is an overriding pressure to place all patients with kidney failure on immediate dialysis, regardless of true need.</p><p>Now a team of French researchers has found that withholding dialysis for 48 hours -- just long enough to see if someone with septic shock will recover on his or her own -- does not increase the risk of kidney failure death.</p><p>The study's lead author, Dr. Saber Barbar, said the finding is close to being \"definitive\" and could lead to a fundamental shift in the way doctors treat such patients.</p><p>\"Our findings were not wholly unexpected,\" said Barbar, chief of the medical intensive care unit at Nimes University Hospital in Nimes, France. \"Another recent study had found similar results to ours, but in patients with kidney failure from all causes, not specifically patients with septic shock, as in our study,\" he added.</p><p>Septic shock is a dangerous reaction to serious infections, such as pneumonia or peritonitis. It results in system-wide inflammation that causes blood pressure to plummet and major organs, such as the kidneys, to fail. </p> <p>\"The criteria used to diagnose acute kidney injury are not very accurate,\" Barbar explained, making it impossible to predict accurately who needs dialysis.</p><p>So why not err on the side of caution and offer it to all patients? </p><p>Dialysis is invasive and there's a risk of infection and bleeding. \"So waiting could help to avoid these risks in certain patients who are going to spontaneously recover,\" Barbar said.</p><p>With that in mind, the study researchers focused on nearly 500 adult patients admitted to a French intensive care unit during the early stages of septic shock. All had signs of kidney failure.</p><p>Half received dialysis within 12 hours of onset of kidney failure. Unless they got worse, the other half received dialysis only after 48 hours, if they needed it.</p><p>Three months later, 58 percent of patients who had immediate dialysis had died, compared with 54 percent of those who delayed dialysis. What's more, 29 percent of patients who waited recovered without dialysis.</p> <p>Based on the findings, Barbar said: \"In the absence of emergency criteria necessitating immediate dialysis, then clinicians can safely wait for 48 hours before starting renal replacement therapy, without incurring any extra risk for the patient, as long as they continue to monitor the patient closely for any signs of complication.\" </p><p>Dr. Steven Simpson, chief medical officer of the San Diego-based Sepsis Alliance, said the findings \"make perfectly good sense.\"</p><p>Dialysis is invasive and should only be used when necessary, Simpson said. It's also risky because running a patient's blood through a machine to clear out toxins lowers blood pressure, and people with septic shock already have very low blood pressure. </p><p>\"If many of the patients in whom they delayed dialysis never needed dialysis at all, then it has to mean that if you jump right in you're giving dialysis to a whole bunch of people who don't need it,\" Simpson said. \"So if this study suggests that there isn't a really good reason to jump right in, then we shouldn't.\"</p><p>Barbar and his colleagues published their findings in the Oct. 11 issue of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more about septic shock and kidney failure at the <a href=\" https://www.sepsis.org/sepsis-and/kidney-failure/treatment/\" target=\"_new\">Sepsis Alliance</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Sept. 25, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The number of newborns suffering from syphilis has nearly tripled in recent years, U.S. health officials reported Tuesday.</p><p>Cases jumped from 362 in 2013 to 918 in 2017 -- the highest number in 20 years. Cases were seen in 37 states, mostly in the West and South.</p><p>\"We've been seeing increases in syphilis among women of reproductive age, and it's not surprising that we are seeing increases among pregnant women,\" said lead researcher Dr. Gail Bolan, director of the Division of STD Prevention at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>There's no simple answer as to why these increases are occurring, she added. Syphilis has long been associated with poverty, drug addiction, homelessness and incarceration, Bolan said.</p><p>In addition, where the health care system isn't trusted, syphilis increases, she noted.</p><p>\"It is these socioeconomic factors, where the fabric of our society is really fraying, and the women who are having babies with syphilis are really on the edge,\" Bolan said.</p><p>The increase in infants with the disease echoes the increase in syphilis cases among women of childbearing age, the agency says. And syphilis is outpacing the increase of other sexually transmitted diseases in the country, the report found. The findings were published Sept. 25 in the CDC's <i>Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance Report</i>.</p><p>Most women who give birth to babies infected with syphilis haven't received prenatal care, Bolan said. The law requires that all women be tested for syphilis at their first prenatal exam, she explained.</p><p>Bolan also said that women at high risk for syphilis should be retested in the third trimester. When the disease is caught early, a simple shot of penicillin can cure both the mother and fetus, she said.</p><p>Left untreated, an infected woman has an 80 percent chance of passing the infection to her infant, the CDC says. When a child is born with syphilis, it can be cured, but the risk of damage to organs that can lead to deafness and delayed development is already underway, Bolan said.</p><p>The CDC says that 1 in 3 women who had a baby with syphilis in 2016 was tested during pregnancy, but either got syphilis after that test or wasn't treated in time to cure the infection in the unborn baby.</p><p>This is why the CDC wants women to be tested early in pregnancy, and women at high risk for the infection to be retested during their pregnancy. This includes women living in areas where syphilis is prevalent.</p><p>In 2017, 64 babies infected with syphilis were stillborn, \"... and we believe that might be an underestimate,\" Bolan said. Infected babies can also die in the months after delivery, she added.</p><p>Sexually active women can lower their risk of getting syphilis by staying in long-term monogamous relationships with someone who's been tested for the disease and using condoms every time they have sex, the CDC advises.</p><p>One sexual health expert noted that syphilis isn't the only STD that is seeing a resurgence.</p><p>\"The jump in congenital syphilis follows a general trend of an increase in reportable STDs,\" said Fred Wyand, director of communications at the American Sexual Health Association.</p><p>Last month, the CDC released a report that found increases in rates of syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Syphilis rates were up 76 percent between 2013 and 2017, he said.</p><p>Part of the reason for the increase is that the STD prevention infrastructure continues to erode, Wyand said. \"Public health is constantly asked to do more education, treatment and surveillance, to name a few critical tasks, but with fewer resources, and we're seeing the predictable consequences of that.\"</p><p>Young people are hit especially hard and account for nearly half of all new STD cases, so naturally this affects women of childbearing age, Wyand explained.</p><p>\"It's crucial that screening guidelines are followed and that pregnant women are tested for syphilis and other STDs very early in pregnancy,\" he said. \"We need to do a better job of educating providers and patients about the necessity of screening for these infections at the first prenatal visit.\"</p><p>David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, echoed that urgency.</p><p>\"Newborns are now paying the price for our nation's growing STD crisis. That we have any cases of syphilis among newborns, let alone an increasing number, is a failure of the health care system,\" Harvey said in a statement. \"It is also a symptom of the larger STD crisis in the U.S. and a sign of a public health system in urgent need of support.</p><p>\"When a baby gets syphilis, it means the system has failed that mother repeatedly, both before and during her pregnancy,\" Harvey added. \"If STD prevention programs had anywhere near the support they need and women were getting quality preventative and prenatal care, no new mom would ever have to cope with this devastating diagnosis.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-syphilis.htm\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> for more on syphilis.</p>",

The faces included people they knew from their personal lives, as well as famous people.</p><p>\"Our study focused on the number of faces people actually know -- we haven't yet found a limit on how many faces the brain can handle,\" said Rob Jenkins, a reader in the department of psychology at the University of York in England.</p><p>\"The ability to distinguish different individuals is clearly important -- it allows you to keep track of people's behavior over time, and to modify your own behavior accordingly,\" he said in a university news release.</p><p>The findings offer a baseline for comparing the \"facial vocabulary\" of people with facial-recognition software now used to identify people in airports and police investigations.</p><p>Jenkins offered several possible explanations for the large range in number of faces people recognized. </p><p>Some people may have a natural aptitude for remembering faces, he said. People also differ in how much attention they pay to faces, and how efficiently they process information.</p><p>\"Alternatively, it could reflect different social environments -- some participants may have grown up in more densely populated places with more social input,\" Jenkins added.</p><p>The average age of the study volunteers was 24. Age is a fertile topic for further study, Jenkins said.</p> <p>\"It would be interesting to see whether there is a peak age for the number of faces we know,\" he said. \"Perhaps we accumulate faces throughout our lifetimes, or perhaps we start to forget some after we reach a certain age.\"</p><p>The report was published Oct. 10 in the <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>People with a condition called <a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Prosopagnosia-Information-Page\" target=\"_new\">prosopagnosia</a> can't recognize faces.</p>",

He is director of Mount Sinai Heart in New York City.</p><p>\"It's a huge high-risk population in which we now can say much more categorically, we are affecting their risk of mortality,\" Fuster said. \"This is not a trivial issue.\"</p><p>The findings are the final long-term follow-up to the landmark FREEDOM trial. (FREEDOM stands for Future Revascularization Evaluation in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus: Optimal Management of Multivessel Disease.) </p><p>Results of the follow-up were also published online Sunday in the <i>Journal of the American College of Cardiology</i>.</p><p>In 2012, the first FREEDOM results showed that diabetics with many blocked arteries had fewer heart attacks and strokes and were less likely to die if they underwent bypass surgery instead of getting a stent.</p><p>But the results for death risk alone were \"borderline\" by the time of the average 3.8-year follow-up, Fuster said. So researchers decided to continue tracking patients and see if a more clear benefit would emerge.</p><p>The initial trial involved 1,900 patients who randomly underwent either stenting or bypass surgery between 2005 and 2010.</p><p>During an additional five years of follow-up, about 24 percent of people who received stents died, compared with 18 percent of those who had bypass surgery.</p><p>Overall, people treated with bypass surgery had 36 percent better odds of survival.</p><p>\"The results are quite significant in terms of mortality,\" Fuster said. \"They're not borderline anymore.\"</p><p>Both men and women and all races saw a survival benefit from bypass surgery, but the greatest benefit was in patients younger than 65, the findings showed.</p><p>Current guidelines already call for bypass surgery in these patients, said Dr. Michael Valentine, president of the American College of Cardiology.</p><p>\"I think what this does is it solidifies our current recommendations and guidelines,\" said Valentine, a senior cardiologist at the Stroobants Cardiovascular Center of Centra Health in Lynchburg, Va. </p><p>Stents can clog over time, and don't address widespread hardening of the arteries in these patients, Valentine and Fuster said.</p><p>\"The vessels stay open longer with an arterial bypass,\" Valentine said.</p><p>Fuster agreed. \"When you use bypass, you bypass everything. It is a safe mechanism. It is a pipe that overcomes everything,\" he said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institutes of Health has more about  <a href=\" https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/coronary-artery-bypass-grafting\" target=\"_new\">coronary bypass surgery</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Sept. 25, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Heather Kinion never spent much time thinking about her weight. But when she got pregnant, that changed. </p><p>\"My sister had a baby a few years before me and had gained a bunch of weight, and she still hadn't lost it when I got pregnant,\" Kinion said. So the Chicago-area mom-to-be was happy to sign up for a nutritional counseling program her doctor's office was offering as part of a study. </p><p>The study program from Northwestern University is dubbed Momfit. It encourages expectant mothers to eat healthy foods, gain the recommended amount of weight, exercise regularly, and sleep seven to nine hours a night. </p><p>Women received in-person nutritional counseling. They also had help from technology: Telephone, text message prompts and e-mail reminders kept pregnancy goals on their minds. The women also tracked what they ate in a smartphone app. </p><p>The goal was not to lose weight, but to gain weight within recommended guidelines. Overall, the Momfit participants gained about 4 fewer pounds throughout pregnancy than those given standard care.</p><p>As for Kinion, she only gained 20 pounds throughout her pregnancy. \"I was really concerned that I would gain a bunch of weight. It was winter, and I like comfort foods, but because I was reporting what I ate, I made sure to eat three servings of vegetables and two fruits, along with whole grains and a decent amount of dairy.\"</p><p>She got better at portion control, too, she said. And the program \"left me room to be indulgent, so I didn't feel deprived. I was able to eat a good balance of foods,\" she added. </p><p>After her daughter's birth, Kinion chose to breastfeed. She said the pregnancy weight came off quickly. </p><p>Study author Linda Van Horn said the study aimed to see if women could safely avoid excess weight gain during pregnancy. </p><p>\"The majority of pregnant women are overweight or obese at the time of conception. It's a major public health concern,\" said Van Horn, a professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.</p><p>The U.S Institute of Medicine recommends that normal-weight women gain 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy, but just 15 to 25 pounds if they're overweight at the start of pregnancy. Women who are obese should only gain 11 to 20 pounds while expecting, the IOM says. </p><p>Gaining too much weight during pregnancy can have consequences for both mom and baby. </p><p>\"Weight gain is definitely a big concern,\" said Dr. Navid Mootabar, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y.</p><p>\"Proper attention to appropriate amount of weight gain results in better pregnancy outcomes. It leads to a decreased risk of high blood pressure and gestational diabetes. Appropriate weight gain also decreases the risk of a cesarean section birth,\" Mootabar said. </p><p>Van Horn added that appropriate weight gain can help new mothers avoid obesity after pregnancy. It can also help children avoid overweight and obesity. </p><p>\"The old saying is, 'You are what you eat.' Now it may be, 'You are what your mother ate,' \" she said. </p><p>The study included nearly 300 pregnant women between 18 and 45 years old. All fell into the overweight or obese range. About 62 percent were white. </p><p>The nutritionists gave half the women advice based on a modified version of the DASH (Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension) diet that focuses on fruits and vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins. It limits saturated fats and discourages sugar-sweetened beverages and snack foods. The \"MAMA-DASH\" diet added more dairy and limited fish that might contain mercury, according to the study. </p><p>Walking was important, too, with Momfit participants asked to walk at least 30 minutes or take 10,000 steps a day.</p><p>Van Horn acknowledged that Momfit isn't a magic bullet. </p><p>\"Moms who were obese were recommended to gain between 10 and 15 pounds, and very few were in that range. But they did gain less than the usual care group. It's a challenge to have moms make those changes in daily dietary calories,\" she said. </p><p>The study also found a higher rate of C-sections in moms who participated in the program. The researchers aren't sure why that is, however. </p><p>One of the bright spots in the study is that moms are using the nutritional lessons with their children. </p><p>\"I definitely make better food choices now, and my daughter Julia eats a lot better than she might have if I hadn't been in the study. She eats lots of vegetables,\" Kinion said. </p><p>The study was published Sept. 24 in the <i>American Journal of Preventive Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has more on <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Nutrition-During-Pregnancy\" target=\"_new\">nutrition during pregnancy</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Sept. 25, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- One of the key members of your health-care team might not be a doctor or a nurse, but a physician assistant.</p><p>A physician assistant -- or PA -- is a specialist with training to fill gaps in primary care, not only in rural communities, but also in busy practices in other areas. If you call your doctor's office with an urgent need, a PA might be the professional who can see you right away.</p><p>The American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA) defines a PA as a medical professional who works as part of a team with a doctor. Physician assistants have three years of generalized training with exposure to many areas of medicine. They are graduates of accredited educational programs that include classroom instruction and clinical rotations, and they're nationally certified and state-licensed to practice medicine with the supervision of a physician.</p><p>The AAPA is pushing to change the requirement that a PA have a set agreement with a doctor in order to practice, which could expand the availability of health-care services in the years to come.</p><p>Besides primary care offices, some PAs work alongside surgeons and have roles in both outpatient and inpatient facilities. You also may find a PA in specialty practices, such as in a cardiologist's office.</p><p>The extent to which a PA is involved with patients is often determined by the practice's supervising doctor.

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 9, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Eating healthier requires a mindset change. But it also helps to make changes in your home environment to encourage a new and better way of approaching food -- starting in the kitchen.</p><p>First, do a deep dive into your fridge. You want to rearrange shelves and drawers to make healthier foods easier to find. This is also a great time to purge both outdated items and foods that just aren't good for you.</p><p>Use drawers for high-calorie foods that you must keep but don't need to see. Then move veggies and fruits to eye level so that every time you open the fridge to look for something to eat, that's what you'll see first. Hint: Prep your veggies and fruits before refrigerating them so you won't first have to clean and cut them when you want a snack.</p><p>Nuts and seeds are loaded with taste and nutrients, but they're also high in calories. Make your own mixes, then measure out 1-ounce servings and package them in baggies or wax paper bundles. Store in the fridge to keep them fresher.</p><p>Always have a pitcher of D.I.Y. flavored water in the fridge to answer the urge for a soda. Experiment with citrus, watermelon or cucumber slices, crushed berries, mint or other herbs to see what tastes best to you.</p><p>Stock your pantry with a selection of oils and a variety of flavored vinegars to make your own salad dressings and marinades. Tip: Delicate oils, like those made from nuts, will last longer in the fridge. Other oils need a cool, dark cabinet -- light is the enemy so don't leave them out on your countertop.</p><p>Fill all your salt shakers with no-salt spice blends instead. These add variety to simple tomato sauces and whole grain pastas as well as steamed veggies.</p><p>It should only take an hour or so to do this kitchen \"remodel,\" but the results can translate to a lifetime of better health.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Cleveland Clinic has <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/10-ways-to-stock-your-fridge-for-weight-loss/\" target=\"_new\">10 tips</a> for stocking your fridge for weight loss.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 26, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- There are many areas of the United States where doctors are in short supply, but the good news for diabetics is that nurse practitioners and physician assistants can often help fill that care gap.</p><p>In fact, new research compared the care given by doctors, nurse practitioners and physician assistants to people with diabetes and found no significant differences in care.</p><p>\"There were no clinically significant differences between nurse practitioners [NPs], physician assistants [PAs] and physicians. This study adds to a body of literature that shows it's very reasonable to have an NP or PA as a primary care provider,\" said study author George Jackson, a research health scientist at the Durham VA Health Care System in North Carolina.</p><p>That's good news since about one-third of those who have a regular primary care provider see a PA or NP at least once a year. Plus, almost half of patients with diabetes see a PA or NP for at least part of their care, according to background information in the study. </p><p>\"PAs, NPs and physicians have different types of training, different times in training and sometimes a different focus in training. But all three commonly serve as primary care providers,\" Jackson explained. All three can prescribe medication and order tests, though there could be limits to what PAs and NPs can prescribe, depending on the state.</p><p>The new research included nearly 370,000 patients. They received care at one of 568 primary care practices in the U.S. Veterans Administration health system. All were receiving medication to treat their diabetes. </p><p>About 75 percent of the patients were treated by physicians. Eighteen percent were treated by nurse practitioners and 7 percent received care from physician assistants, the study authors said. </p><p>The researchers looked at blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. There were no significant differences in these measures based on whether a doctor, NP or PA treated patients. </p><p>The findings were published Nov. 19 in the <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p>Dr. Anne Peters, from the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, wrote in an accompanying editorial, \"The time has come to embrace many different approaches to providing primary care, particularly for persons with a chronic disease, such as diabetes.\"</p><p>She concluded, \"Nurse practitioners and PAs are competent PCPs [primary care providers] in their own right and should be fully accepted as such.\" </p><p>Dr. Jonathan Sobel, president and chair of the Board of Directors of the American Academy of PAs, said he wasn't at all surprised by the findings. \"People should feel confident in PAs. More and more studies are demonstrating the high quality care provided by PAs,\" he said.</p><p>Sobel explained that physician assistants receive thousands of hours of training. And, he said that diabetes is a perfect example of a condition that PAs can manage well. </p><p>\"PAs are a very important part of the solution to the physician shortage, especially in rural areas,\" Sobel said. </p><p>He noted that insurance -- especially Medicare -- may dictate what types of services these providers can offer. For example, he said, Medicare won't allow PAs to prescribe special shoes for people with diabetes. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about physician assistants and nurse practitioners from the <a href=\"https://nursejournal.org/nurse-practitioner/np-vs-physician-assistants/\" target=\"_new\">Nurse Journal</a>.</p>",

But if you don't know how they work you could be inviting an accident, new research suggests.</p><p>These advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) -- including blind-spot monitoring, forward-collision warning and lane-keeping assist  -- can, when used properly, make your driving safer. But many drivers are unaware of the limitations of these advances, the authors of the report said.</p><p>\"When properly utilized, advanced driver assistance system technologies have the potential to prevent 40 percent of all vehicle crashes and nearly 30 percent of traffic deaths,\" said Dr. David Yang, executive director of the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.</p><p>But the new findings, published Sept. 26 by the foundation, show that a lot of work needs to be done in educating drivers about the limitations of these devices and their proper use, he added.</p><p>For example, nearly eight out  of 10 drivers with blind-spot monitoring systems didn't know the limitations of this feature. These systems only work when a car is traveling in a driver's blind spot, and many systems do not detect vehicles traveling at high speeds.</p><p>Not understanding driver assistance systems may lead to misuse or over-reliance and could result in a deadly crash, the researchers said.</p><p>In the United States in 2016, more than 37,400 people were killed in traffic crashes -- a 5 percent increase from 2015, according to a AAA news release.</p><p>For the new study, researchers from the University of Iowa surveyed drivers who purchased a 2016 or 2017 car with ADAS technologies. </p><p>The investigators evaluated drivers' opinions, awareness and understanding of these safety features, and found that most did not know or understand the limitations of these systems.</p><p>Most drivers (80 percent) did not know the limitations of blind-spot detectors. Many incorrectly believed that the systems could monitor the road behind the car or reliably detect bicycles, pedestrians and vehicles passing at high speed.</p><p>As for forward-collision warning and automatic emergency braking systems, nearly 40 percent did not know the systems' limits or confused the two technologies. </p><p>Drivers incorrectly assumed that forward-collision warning would apply the brakes in the case of an emergency, but the technology is only designed to deliver a warning signal, the researchers said. </p><p>In addition, one in six drivers didn't know if their vehicle had automatic emergency braking.</p><p>About 25 percent of drivers felt comfortable that blind-spot systems would pick up pedestrians and traffic, so they didn't do visual checks or look over their shoulder for oncoming traffic or pedestrians.</p><p>Moreover, about 25 percent of drivers with forward-collision warning or lane-departure warning systems felt comfortable doing other tasks while driving.</p> <p>\"New vehicle safety technology is designed to make driving safer, but it does not replace the important role each of us plays behind the wheel,\" Yang said in the news release.</p><p>These findings should motivate more focus on the importance of educating new and used car buyers about how safety technologies work, the study authors said.</p><p>Only about half of the drivers who purchased a new car from a dealership recalled being offered training on the new technology. Among those who were, nearly 90 percent completed the training.</p><p>AAA advises all new car owners to read up on the car's safety devices and actually see how they work. Drivers should also ask the dealer questions to be sure they understand what these safety features will and will not do.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"https://exchange.aaa.com/automotive/automotive-testing/advanced-driver-assistance-systems/#.W6u2QaeZPOR\" target=\"_new\"> AAA Exchange</a> for more on driving safety.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 3, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- On her way to watch her beloved Kansas City Chiefs play in 2016, Leah Huss felt sensations far different from the usual pre-game jitters.</p> <p>There was shortness of breath. And a heaviness in the left side of her chest.</p> <p>Worse yet, those feelings were awfully familiar.</p> <p>Seven years after surviving a \"widow maker\" heart attack, she knew she was having another. And that there was no time to waste.</p> <p>Huss got to the hospital in time for doctors to discover that the stents that had propped open crucial arteries in her heart had become clogged again. She underwent an emergency procedure to re-open them, allowing the blood to begin flowing again.</p> <p>But for how long? Her doctor was concerned enough to mention she may need a new heart.</p> <p>That was nearly two years ago. Despite the challenges, she's determined to embrace life and so, in a few days, she'll walk down the aisle to be married.</p> <p>Huss' story begins in 2009. At 38, she was in the best shape of her life.</p> <p>In fact, she'd just gotten home from a 5-mile walk when she started feeling short of breath and tightness in her chest.</p> <p>Many people might have chalked these symptoms up to overexertion. As the nurse manager of an emergency department, however, she knew better.</p> <p>Doctors discovered that her left anterior descending coronary artery -- the one that supplies most of the blood to the heart -- was 100 percent blocked. And her right coronary artery was 60 percent blocked. Three stents later, blood flow to her heart had been restored. She also received a defibrillator to help keep her heart in rhythm.</p> <p>Huss was diagnosed with heart failure, which means her heart wasn't pumping blood as efficiently as it should. She managed this by returning to her healthy lifestyle.</p> <p>Then came November 2016 and the sensations she recognized right away, all of which led to her doctor -- Dr. Prashanth Katrapati, an interventional cardiologist with Providence Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas -- to mention the possibility of a heart transplant.</p> <p>\"She's lost heart muscle,\" he said. \"People usually don't live 30 years with a heart like hers. I wanted to get her prepared for the possibility.\"</p> <p>Although she presented a brave face after the first heart attack, her resolve weakened after the second.</p> <p>While she and Ronnie Monroe had known each other for years, they'd only recently become a couple and were getting serious. She steeled herself and asked if he really wanted to stay with someone with such dire health problems.</p> <p>He replied that he most certainly did.</p> <p>\"I never saw someone who had a heart issue or any type of physical limitation,\" said Monroe, a systems analyst with the U.S. Department of Defense, who often accompanies Huss to her doctor appointments. \"I saw someone who worked really hard and embraced both having fun and a heart condition.\"</p> <p>While Katrapati continues to regularly monitor her heart, all Huss' attention these days is on their October wedding, scheduled to take place in Overland Park, Kansas.</p> <p>\"I've had some close calls, but Ronnie and I know this is our chance to throw a big party to celebrate our love,\" she said. \"Because I know that life is precious.\"</p> <p>She also knows that too many women think heart attacks only happen to men, especially older men. And she knows that heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women -- more than all forms of cancer combined. She also knows the warning signs can be different for women.</p> <p>She has used that knowledge to her advantage. Twice. Now she shares her story in the hopes it will inspire others, too.</p>",

While protecting yourself, you are also protecting those around you.\"</p><p>The estimated 80,000 who died from flu and its complications last winter amounted to the most seasonal deaths since the CDC started calculating flu season death tolls in 1976, CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund told <i>CNN</i>.</p><p>The worst recent flu season on record had been 2012-2013, during which 56,000 people died. H3N2 flu predominated that season as well.</p><p>A record 180 children died from the flu during the 2017-2018 season, exceeding the 171 deaths that occurred during the 2012-2013 season, the CDC reported.</p><p>\"A majority of them were unvaccinated,\" Adams said. During most flu seasons, eight out of 10 reported pediatric deaths occur in children not fully vaccinated against flu.</p><p>In addition, a record-breaking 900,000 hospitalizations were caused by the flu during the last season, prompting news coverage of hospitals overflowing with sick people.</p><p>The 2017-2018 season is the first ever to be classified as high severity across all age groups, the CDC added.</p><p>It didn't help that vaccination rates dipped even as the United States faced this deadly wave of flu, infection experts said.</p><p>Overall vaccinations declined by 1.1 percent, to 57.9 percent from 59 percent the previous season.</p><p>More troubling were declines in specific groups that either are vulnerable to the flu or in a position to further spread the virus.</p><p>Fewer children aged 6 months to 4 years old received a flu shot last season, Adams said.</p><p>\"These kids are often particularly vulnerable to serious complications if they get sick, even if they were previously healthy,\" Adams said.</p><p>Young children also are prime vectors for spreading the flu throughout their families, including grandparents whose immune systems aren't as capable of battling the virus, explained Dr. Wendy Sue Swanson. She is chief of digital innovation at Seattle Children's Hospital and a mother of two little boys.</p><p>\"Kids have a lot of snot and they have a lot of drool, and they go to school,\" Swanson said. \"And when they go to school, they share all of those secretions. Now, they're lovely and we love them, but they are a lot of the reason flu moves around communities.\"</p><p>There also was a decline in vaccination rates among pregnant women during the last flu season, the CDC said.</p><p>The immune systems of pregnant women are compromised, making them more vulnerable to the flu, explained Dr. Laura Elizabeth Riley, director of obstetrics and gynecology infectious disease at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.</p><p>\"When pregnant women get really high fever for extended periods of time, we know that fever actually causes birth defects,\" Riley said. \"That's something that is preventable.\"</p><p>And Adams added that pregnant women who get a flu shot also help protect their unborn babies. Children younger than 6 months can't receive a flu shot, so their only guard against the flu is whatever antibodies have passed to them from their mothers.</p><p> Swanson pointed out that \"a child who's born to a mom who's immunized has a 72 percent reduction in having hospitalization from flu in those first months of life.\"</p><p>A number of vaccine types are available, including a nasal spray, public health officials said Thursday.</p><p>Adams led by example at Thursday's news briefing, receiving his flu vaccination along with former Cleveland Browns lineman Joe Thomas and Dr. Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about the <a href=\" https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season-2017-2018.htm \" target=\"_new\">2017-2018 flu season</a>.</p>",

And, particularly in the early grades, those age gaps can make a big difference in behavior, researchers said. </p><p>\"Physicians should take into account a child's age relative to their peers. Behavior that is normal for a child's age may appear anomalous when compared to older peers,\" explained study author Timothy Layton, an assistant professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School. </p><p>The consequences from not factoring in age might be overdiagnosis and overtreatment of the disorder, according to Layton. He noted that kids born in August (in areas with a September birthday cutoff) were also more likely to be given medication for ADHD symptoms. </p><p>ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that's common in children, but it may not always last into adulthood, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Kids with ADHD may have trouble controlling their behavior, may act impulsively and may be overly active, the CDC says. </p><p>ADHD rates have been rising sharply among America's youth. Over the past two decades, the rate of ADHD jumped from 6 percent to 10 percent, according to a recent study from the University of Iowa.</p><p>In children between ages 2 and 5, the rate of ADHD diagnosis went up by 50 percent between 2007 and 2012, according to background information from the study. In 2016, more than 5 percent of U.S. children were being treated with medication for ADHD. </p><p>There's no single test that can diagnose ADHD, the CDC says. Instead, doctors must rely on a medical exam, along with information from parents, teachers and, sometimes, the child. Doctors have to rule out other disorders that can cause symptoms similar to ADHD. </p><p>To see how a child's birth date might affect the risk of being diagnosed with ADHD, the researchers reviewed data from a large insurance database with information on more than 400,000 youngsters from 50 states. The kids were born between 2007 and 2009, and followed through 2015. </p><p>In states that had a Sept. 1 cutoff date for starting kindergarten, the researchers found that 85 out of 10,000 August-born youngsters were diagnosed with ADHD. For those born in September, the ADHD rate was 64 per 10,000 kids. </p><p>When the researchers looked at treatment for ADHD, they found that 53 out of 10,000 children born in August were getting ADHD medication, compared to 40 out of 10,000 kids born in September. </p><p>Layton said these findings would likely hold true in districts that had other cutoff dates for starting school. For example, in a school with a Dec. 1 birthday cutoff for school entry, kids born in November would probably be more likely to receive an ADHD diagnosis than kids born in December. </p><p>Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y., said, \"This nicely designed study has confirmed what several other investigators have likewise demonstrated -- that the youngest children within a grade are more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than are the oldest children in that same grade.\" </p><p>Adesman, who was not part of the study, said that if the researchers looked at kids closer in age in the same grade, say, just a few months apart, the differences would likely be smaller. </p><p>He said this study suggests that parents of kids who are young for their grade who have ADHD symptoms may want to consider having their child repeat a grade. This might give a child time to mature, so he or she will behave more appropriately in school. </p><p>The findings were published Nov. 28 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics' Healthy Children website has more on <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/adhd/Pages/Diagnosing-ADHD-in-Children-Guidelines-Information-for-Parents.aspx\" target=\"_new\">diagnosing ADHD</a>.</p>",

They compared three states (Arizona, Maine and New York) that expanded Medicaid in 2001-2002 and states that did not expand Medicaid.</p><p>Those Medicaid expansions occurred shortly before the spike in overdose deaths nationwide.</p><p>Just prior to expanding Medicaid, Arizona, Maine and New York had about 2 fewer overdose deaths per 100,000 people than all non-expansion states. By 2008, the expansion states had about 7 fewer overdose deaths per 100,000 people, the study found.</p><p>The researchers also found that just before expansion, Arizona, Maine and New York had about 8 fewer deaths per 100,000 people than adjacent non-expansion states. By 2008, the expansion states had 17 fewer deaths per 100,000 people.</p><p>Overall, drug overdose deaths were nearly 20 percent lower in the expansion states than they would have been without Medicaid expansion, according to the study authors.</p><p>The findings were published online recently in the <i>Journal of General Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p>The study did not examine how Medicaid expansions might have reduced drug overdose deaths, and only observed an association.

That's what we found, even though what kids are getting really hasn't changed.\"</p><p>Since 2013, the four largest fast food restaurant chains -- McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's and Subway -- have introduced policies to offer healthier drinks and sides with their kids' meals, Harris said.</p><p>To see whether these policies have made a difference, the Rudd Center conducted an online survey with approximately 800 parents regarding lunch or dinner purchases at one of the big four chains.</p><p>Published Sept. 27, the Rudd survey found that 74 percent of kids still receive unhealthy drinks or side items with their kids' meals when they eat fast food:</p><ul><li>Only 6 out of 10 parents who purchased a kids' meal received a healthier drink such as low-fat milk or fruit juice, indicating no change between 2010 and 2016.</li><li>Two-thirds of parents chose a healthier drink for a preschool-age child (2-5), on average, but only half chose a healthier drink for an older child (6-11).</li><li>Half of parents received a healthier side with a kids' meal in 2016, such as yogurt or apple slices. However, 6 out of 10 received an unhealthy side like french fries or chips, since some restaurants now offer two sides with kids' meals.</li></ul><p>The healthy-option policies have made a difference in one critical way, however.</p><p>Nearly all of the parents said they plan to purchase fast food for their child more often because of restaurants' healthier kids' meal policies, researchers found.</p><p>\"When you ask parents about that, they think it's great that kids' meals are healthier now,\" Harris said. \"But there really hasn't been any change.\"</p><p>About one-third of parents didn't even bother with a kids' meal for their children. They purchased regular menu items, which include adult-sized portions and tend to be less nutritious than kids' meal items.</p><p>The Rudd Center argues that policymakers should follow the lead of communities in California, Colorado, Kentucky and Maryland, where laws or regulations have been adopted to require that all restaurants automatically provide healthy drinks and sides with kids' meals.</p><p>Restaurants can help by promoting healthier choices and discontinuing the practice of offering unhealthy sides alongside healthier sides, the Rudd Center added.</p><p>But parents also need to step up, said registered dietitian nutritionist Malina Linkas Malkani, a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.</p><p>\"Until there is more widely enacted legislation that requires the restaurants to automatically offer these healthy choices, the responsibility falls pretty squarely on parents and caregivers to make the healthier choices and to teach their children how to make those choices for themselves,\" Malkani said.</p><p>Parents should teach kids to avoid foods heavy in added sugars, sodium and saturated fat, Malkani said. They also should promote foods rich in protein, calcium, vitamin D, iron, healthy fats and vitamin C.</p><p>Malkani said it was \"disheartening to hear the high percentage of children who received the less healthy beverages and sides, but I did think it was good news that there are healthier beverages and sides available.</p><p>\"I have to give so much credit to the chains that are offering the healthier choices automatically. I hope this is a trend that takes off,\" she said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians has more about <a href=\"https://familydoctor.org/making-healthy-choices-fast-food-restaurants/\" target=\"_new\">healthy fast food choices</a>.</p>",

So said the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention late Tuesday in an interview with the <i>Associated Press</i>.</p><p>As autumn brings another flu season, CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield told the <i>AP</i> that \"I'd like to see more people get vaccinated.\"  </p><p>The agency recommends that everyone over the age of 6 months get the annual flu shot.</p><p>Last year's flu season made headlines for its scope and severity, but the new number still surprised experts.</p><p>\"That's huge,\" Dr, William Schaffer, a vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, told the <i>AP</i>. He said that 80,000 deaths is more than double the number expected in a typical \"bad\" flu season. In recent years, the annual flu death toll has ranged from 12,000 to 56,000 deaths, the CDC said.</p><p>The 2017-2018 flu season was made worse by two factors:  strains that hit the very young and elderly especially hard, and a poor matchup between those strains and those in the flu vaccine.</p><p>Still, even the relatively weak flu shot probably saved many lives, CDC experts say, so everyone should avail themselves of the shot again this season.</p><p>The flu typically kills by triggering other deadly conditions such as pneumonia, stroke and heart attack. The most deadly flu season on record remains that of thew 1918 pandemic, when upwards of 500,000 Americans are thought to have died.</p><p>As for the coming season, the CDC says that, so far, at least the circulating strain seems to be a milder one, and there are preliminary signs that the vaccine match is good.</p><p>\"We don't know what's going to happen, but we're seeing more encouraging signs than we were early last year,\" CDC flu expert Dr. Daniel Jernigan told the <i>AP</i>.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Opioid Bill Gets Bipartisan Support</b></span></p><p>In a rare bipartisan move, both the House and Senate have reached a compromise on legislation to address the opioid epidemic.</p><p>Containing a mix of law enforcement and public health measures, including one that aims to block deadly fentanyl from being imported through the mail and one that will allow more nurses to prescribe medication for opioid addiction, the bill is 653 pages long, the <i>New York Times</i> reported.</p><p>Yet another part of the legislation could make it easier for Medicaid recipients to get inpatient care for substance abuse over the next five years, the newspaper said.</p><p>\"While there is more work to be done, this bipartisan legislation takes an important step forward and will save lives,\" a group of Republican and Democratic committee leaders said in a statement Tuesday.</p><p>But addiction experts say that while many of the measures will help incrementally, the investment still falls short of what is needed to stem the tide of opioid abuse. Nearly 50,000 Americans died in opioid-related deaths in 2017, the <i>Times</i> reported.</p><p>Both chambers still need to vote on the compromise bill. The House could vote this week, before its members adjourn to hit the campaign trail, and the Senate could take it up next week.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Oct. 5, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- A routine visit to the doctor's office typically results in a single blood pressure measurement.</p> <p>But for people on the verge of being diagnosed with high blood pressure, or hypertension, visits usually involve several additional checks at the office, along with a recommendation of having more taken at home. But how many?</p> <p>At least three days' worth, according to a new study published Oct. 5 in the <i>Journal of the American Heart Association</i>.</p> <p>\"Our paper is really to help practicing clinicians figure out what's enough when it comes to number of measurements for them to feel confident that they have a good representation of patients' blood pressure outside the clinic,\" said study author Dr. Natalie Bello, an assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City.</p> <p>Home blood pressure monitoring is a common approach after a patient has been screened at a clinic, but before the person receives an official hypertension diagnosis. That's because measurements taken in a medical office can sometimes be misleadingly high. For some patients, nerves or stress related to being at the doctor's office can be enough to spike blood pressure. In others, conversely, their number will look normal at the clinic, but high at home because of environmental factors.</p> <p>The study looked at 316 adults who were not on medication for blood pressure. Participants did not have a history of cardiovascular disease and were otherwise healthy. Their blood pressure was taken multiple times during two clinical visits, and they were given a blood pressure monitoring device that electronically stores information from each use. They also were given detailed instructions on how to obtain the most accurate measurement possible.</p> <p>Over two weeks, participants were asked to take measurements twice in the morning and twice again at night.</p> <p>\"Using the average of morning and evening readings, a minimum of three days are needed to reliably estimate out-of-office blood pressure and confirm a diagnosis of hypertension,\" the researchers wrote in their report.</p> <p>Using blood pressure guidelines released last November, which set new hypertension thresholds, participants who consistently took two readings in the morning and two readings in the evening would only need two days of home measurements. If they only took one in the morning and one in the evening, the study showed three days was the ideal time frame to help confirm a diagnosis of high blood pressure.</p> <p>The guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, which defined hypertension as a measurement of 130/80 rather than the previous 140/90, emphasized having patients monitor their own blood pressure as part of \"hypertension diagnosis, treatment and management.\"</p> <p>Dr. Paul Whelton, who chaired the guideline writing committee, commended the study's design and analysis but urged caution about some of its limitations. People who are candidates for home blood pressure monitoring because they may have hypertension are different than the ones seen in the study, he said.</p> <p>The average age of participants was 42, and people with chronic kidney disease, overt cardiovascular problems and other health conditions were excluded, he said. In addition, the study included only a small number of people with diabetes.</p> <p>\"They were looking at a younger cohort that's healthier [but] if you walk into any clinic where you see patients with high blood pressure, they're going to be older and sicker\" and have a combination of chronic conditions, said Whelton, an epidemiology professor at Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in New Orleans.</p> <p>Blood pressure can easily fluctuate depending on when and how it is measured, he added.</p> <p>\"We take terrible measurements of blood pressure. But whether it's in the office or at home, it can be done well. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to do a good blood pressure,\" Whelton said.</p> <p>Patients need a period of rest before the measurement and a proper cuff size, he said. They shouldn't talk and should sit in a chair with an upright back with feet on the floor. \"Those are the key issues to avoiding predictable errors.\"</p> <p>Bello said it's also important that patients use equipment that has been validated for clinical accuracy.</p> <p>\"Not everything that's available in the pharmacy has necessarily been validated,\" she said, urging people already using home-based devices to bring them in to their doctor's office for review at least once.</p>",

But new research suggests that women who've undergone weight-loss surgery might have a safer delivery.</p><p>\"We know that obesity and overweight are dangerous in connection with childbirth,\" said study author Dr. Olof Stephansson, of Karolinska Institute in Solna, Sweden.</p><p>Weight-loss [bariatric] surgery \"is by far your best option if you want a lasting weight reduction over time,\" he said in an institute news release. </p><p>The study of almost 6,000 women found weight-loss surgery was tied to fewer cesarean sections, infections, tears, hemorrhages or post-term deliveries.</p><p>Obesity in pregnancy is a growing problem. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the percentage of American women who were obese at the start of their pregnancy jumped 8 percent between 2011 and 2015. And overweight rates at conception increased 2 percent during that same period.</p><p>For the new study, researchers compared the deliveries of more than 1,400 women who had undergone weight-loss surgery and lost a significant amount of weight with the deliveries of almost 4,500 women who did not have this type of surgery. </p><p>\"The effects were quite salient, and all of those we studied were to the benefit of the women who'd had surgery,\" Stephansson said. \"There are a lower proportion of C-sections, fewer induced deliveries, a lower proportion of post-term deliveries, less frequent epidurals and fewer cases of uterine inertia, infection, perineal tears and hemorrhaging,\" he said.</p><p>The findings of this observational study don't prove cause and effect, but the researchers suggested that weight loss before pregnancy helped ensure a safer childbirth. But they noted that previous studies have shown that women who've had weight-loss surgery are at slightly higher risk for premature delivery or having smaller babies.</p><p>\"It's therefore not as simple as just advising every woman who's overweight to have bariatric surgery,\" Stephansson said. \"But going by the results of this study, it has positive effects for mothers. More studies are needed in which we weigh up outcomes so that we can give a more general recommendation.\"</p><p>The study was published recently in <i>PLOS Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases provides more on <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/bariatric-surgery/types\" target=\"_new\"> weight-loss surgery</a>.</p>",

People were asked about 94 topics. The survey  found nearly 74 percent of respondents saying they were \"afraid\" or \"very afraid\" about corrupt government officials.</p><p>The other top fears were: pollution of oceans, rivers and lakes (61.6 percent); pollution of drinking water (60.7 percent); not having enough money for the future (57 percent); people they love becoming seriously ill (56.5 percent); people they love dying (56.4 percent); air pollution (55 percent); extinction of plant and animal species (54 percent); global warming and climate change (53.2 percent): and high medical bills (53 percent).</p><p>This year, each of the top 10 fears were held by more than half of those surveyed, compared with only five of the top 10 fears in 2017, according to the researchers behind the survey.</p><p>The researchers pointed to two notable trends.</p><p>Since 2016, there has been a 13 percent increase in fear of corrupt government officials. There were no significant differences by political affiliation.</p><p>And no environmental concern made the top 10 list in 2016, compared with five this year, the researchers noted.</p><p>The findings \"illustrate a continued shift in the primary concerns of American citizens,\" Christopher Bader, a professor of sociology, said in a university news release.</p><p>\"It is worth noting that &hellip; all top 10 fears continue to reflect topics often discussed in the media,\" he added.</p><p>The survey challenges President Donald Trump's concerns about immigration. Only 18 percent of respondents said they agreed or strongly agreed that immigrants are more likely to commit crime than U.S. citizens, Bader said.</p><p>The survey also assessed disaster preparedness and people's willingness to evacuate. Even though 21 percent of the respondents said they or their family members have had to suddenly leave their homes due to disaster, a higher percentage cited reasons why they would not or could not evacuate.</p><p>These include: wanting to protect their home from looting (43 percent); unwillingness to leave pets behind (34 percent); survived past storms without evacuating (34 percent); the cost of food, gas and lodging (32 percent); having a disability or someone in the home with a disability (14 percent); and lack of transportation (14 percent).</p><p>The survey also asked respondents about seven paranormal beliefs, including ghosts, aliens, psychic powers and hauntings.</p><p>\"More than [75 percent] of Americans believe in at least one paranormal phenomenon compared to 64 percent in previous years,\" Bader said.</p><p>The most common paranormal belief is that places can be haunted by spirits (58 percent), followed by the belief that ancient, advanced civilizations -- such as Atlantis -- once existed (57 percent). More than 41 percent of respondents believe that aliens visited Earth in ancient times and more than one-third believe aliens are still making visits.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Anxiety and Depression Association of America offers <a href=\"https://adaa.org/tips-manage-anxiety-and-stress\" target=\"_new\">tips to manage anxiety and stress</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 8, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Treatments for \"tennis elbow\" are generally ineffective, researchers say, but don't despair: The painful condition will usually clear up on its own.</p> <p>Each year, approximately 200,000 Americans are diagnosed with tennis elbow -- inflammation caused by overuse of the tendons in the forearm. The condition can affect anyone who uses their hands and wrists for hours each day, such as carpenters, food workers, manufacturers and office workers.</p><p>Patients can choose from a host of treatments, including steroid injections, physical therapy, acupuncture, anti-inflammatories, Botox injections, ultrasound and laser therapy. But significant pain relief from these options is unlikely, a new study found.</p><p>\"We evaluated almost all of the nonsurgical treatments available for tennis elbow and showed that they provide only minimal effect over placebo,\" said study author Dr. Amin Mohamadi, a research fellow at Harvard Medical School.</p><p>For example, corticosteroids were more effective than a placebo within the first four weeks, but they lost their advantage after that, he said. </p><p>So what can someone with a bum elbow do?</p><p>Doctors can opt for a pain reliever to manage symptoms on a patient-to-patient basis, Mohamadi said. His team suggested this be limited to four weeks. </p><p>\"Our results imply that for most patients, tennis elbow is a self-limiting condition,\" he said. \"Based on these findings, the overall recommendation is wait and see.\"</p><p>Dr. Steven Beldner is co-director of the New York Hand and Wrist Center at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>Beldner, who was not involved with the study, agreed that for most patients, tennis elbow gets better by itself.</p><p>\"The question is, do people really want to suffer with this condition for six or seven months?\" he said. The pain can be so great that some people may have to avoid using their arm, he noted. </p><p>And not every case of tennis elbow will improve unaided, Beldner added.</p><p>\"Five percent of people who have this, no matter what treatment they undergo, will not get better and will eventually need surgery,\" Beldner said.</p><p>For the study, Mohamadi's team reviewed 36 previously published studies that included more than 2,700 patients. The papers evaluated 11 nonsurgical treatments for tennis elbow.</p><p>The researchers looked at the effects of treatment on pain and grip strength at four weeks after diagnosis, between five and 26 weeks after diagnosis and after more than 26 weeks.</p><p>None of the treatments showed any significant benefit within four weeks of diagnosis, according to the study.</p><p>After 26 weeks, the researchers found that 99 percent of patients who received placebos such as saline injections or sugar pills had little to no pain. </p><p>At five to 26 weeks, those who had laser therapy or Botox injections said they had a small but statistically significant reduction in pain, compared with those who had other treatments. </p><p>After 26 weeks, only those treated with shock wave therapy reported any long-term benefit, compared with other treatments. Patients who had steroid injections complained of worse pain than those given placebo injections, the researchers noted. </p><p>Regarding grip strength, only laser therapy outperformed placebos, the researchers said.</p><p>The study also found that reported side effects were more prevalent among those given a real treatment than those given sham treatment.</p><p>But for manual laborers who can't \"wait and see,\" earlier treatment might help, the researchers said. However, that needs to be proved in randomized trials, they added.</p><p>The report was published Nov. 1 in the <i>American Journal of Sports Medicine</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons offers more on <a href=\"https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/tennis-elbow-lateral-epicondylitis/\" target=\"_new\">tennis elbow</a>.</p>",

A healthy lifestyle may be your best defense, new research shows.</p><p>The study of more than 306,000 white British people found that exercising, eating right and not smoking lowered stroke risk --   even for those whose DNA predisposed them to the attacks.</p><p>The findings \"highlight the potential of lifestyle measures to reduce risk of stroke across entire populations, even in those at high genetic risk of stroke,\" said a team led by Loes Rutten-Jacobs, a researcher at the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, in Bonn.</p><p>The 7-year study tracked outcomes for thousands of U.K. residents. They ranged in age from 40 to 73 at the beginning of the study and had no prior history of stroke or heart attack.</p><p>The researchers used 90 gene variants known to be linked to stroke to calculate a \"genetic risk score\" for each study participant.</p><p>Genes did matter, of course. Overall, the stroke rate rose by 35 percent for people with a high genetic risk score compared to those with a low score, the study authors found.</p><p>However, people with a healthy lifestyle -- not smoking, not overweight, getting regular exercise, and eating a diet rich in fruit, vegetables and fish -- had a 66 percent lower risk of stroke than those with an unhealthy lifestyle. That held true regardless of their level of genetic risk for stroke, the researchers said.</p><p>Lifestyle seemed especially crucial for people at a high genetic risk for stroke. According to the study, people with a high genetic risk <i>plus</i> an unhealthy lifestyle more than doubled their odds for stroke, compared to people who combined a low genetic risk with a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>Gender seemed to matter, too.  Across all categories of genetic risk and lifestyle, men had a higher stroke risk than women, according to the study published online Oct. 24 in the <i>BMJ</i>.</p><p>The study couldn't prove cause and effect, but experts in the United States said the findings make sense.</p><p>They \"remind us again that a healthy lifestyle should be emphasized in all populations,\" said Dr. Eugenia Gianos, who directs women's heart health at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>\"Smoking was associated with the highest rates of stroke,\" she noted, \"and risk was high in smokers whether they had a high or low genetic risk.\"</p><p>Dr. Andrew Rogove directs stroke services at Northwell Health's Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y.   He said the study was limited by its focus on white patients, and it didn't separate out various subtypes of stroke.</p><p>However, \"it is nonetheless important to show that people can choose healthy lifestyle modifications to reduce their risk of stroke, independent of their predetermined genetic composition,\" Rogove said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart Association has more on <a href=\"http://www.strokeassociation.org/idc/groups/stroke-public/@wcm/@hcm/documents/downloadable/ucm_309712.pdf\" target=\"_new\">lifestyle changes to reduce stroke risk</a>.</p>",

He's a kidney transplant doctor and associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine.</p><p>The study shows that France is using kidneys from donors who are much older, on average, than in the United States.</p><p>\"Basically they're accepting donor kidneys that are much lower quality and higher risk,\" Reese said. \"To me, it shows that this other country with a very advanced health care system that looks a lot like our own in many ways is pushing the envelope on the donors and the transplants that they'll do, whereas we really aren't.\"</p><p>There currently are more than 95,000 people on the U.S. kidney transplant waiting list, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), the nonprofit that manages America's organ transplant system.</p> <p>Despite this shortage, approximately 2,000 donated kidneys are discarded each year, researchers said.</p><p>\"In the United States, there are a lot of kidneys that are procured but not transplanted,\" said Dr. David Klassen, chief medical officer for UNOS. \"As far as we can tell, there are some we believe really could be transplanted and should be transplanted.\"</p><p>To gain some insight into the issue, Reese worked with a French research team to compare the relative health of donated kidneys in each country and how the organs are used.</p><p>The researchers evaluated transplant data from 2004 to 2014, during which time more than 156,000 kidneys in the United States and nearly 30,000 kidneys in France were procured for transplant.</p><p>A much higher proportion of kidneys were higher-risk organs in France, scoring an average 65 on the Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI), compared with an average score of 42 for U.S. kidneys used in transplant.</p><p>Lower scores are associated with longer function. For example, kidneys with a KDPI between 0 and 20 are expected to function an average of 11.5 years, while those with a KDPI between 21 and 85 are expected to function about 9 years, according to the federal Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.</p><p>French surgeons tend to accept kidneys for transplantation from much older recipients, the researchers found.</p><p>\"The mean age of the French donors was 17 years older than the United States,\" Reese said. \"They are responding to the organ crisis by accepting older and older donors.\"</p><p>Accepted kidneys in France also tended to be more often from donors with chronic conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes, Reese said.</p><p>Because of this, the French average KDPI rose from 54 to 67 during the decade, while the U.S. average KDPI increased only from 42 to 44.</p><p>\"Over 10 years in the United States, there was really no change in the age of the donors and the quality of the donors,\" Reese said.</p><p>The United States could do a better job matching kidneys to recipients, even if the organs aren't the best quality, Reese concluded.</p><p>He gave the example of a kidney donated by an 80-year-old person.</p><p>\"It would be a mistake to take that kidney in the United States if the recipient is 30 years old, but we have people who are on our kidney transplant waiting list who are over 70,\" Reese said. \"If we tried hard, I don't think we would have too much difficulty finding appropriate recipients for these kidneys from older donors.\"</p><p>Klassen, who wasn't involved with the study, said that U.S. transplant centers tend to be risk-averse because they don't want to run afoul of regulators and endanger their certification.</p><p>\"Transplanting organs that might be viewed as higher risk into potential recipients who might be viewed as higher risk, transplant centers view that as something they would choose not to do,\" Klassen said.</p><p>To be fair, there are some donated organs that simply shouldn't be taken. \"Just because a kidney is procured and possibly could be transplanted doesn't mean that it should be,\" Klassen said.</p><p>There also are major differences in the organ donation and transplant system between France and the United States, in terms of how organ quality is judged and kidneys are biopsied at the time of organ offer. \"It's hard to say the results of one country would directly translate to another country,\" Klassen said.</p><p>But the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services tacitly admitted there's an oversight problem. The agency has put out for comment a rule change that would loosen its monitoring criteria, Klassen said.</p><p>\"They would look at other measures of program quality and not focus specifically on patient one-year outcomes as the sole measure of program quality,\" Klassen said. \"I don't think monitoring of patient and graft outcomes will ever go away, but I think using a broader palette of quality of measures would be an appropriate thing to do in terms of judging transplant programs.\"</p><p>The study was scheduled for presentation Sunday at the American Society of Nephrology's annual meeting, in San Diego. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network has more about the <a href=\"https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/resources/guidance/kidney-donor-profile-index-kdpi-guide-for-clinicians/\" target=\"_new\">Kidney Donor Profile Index</a>.</p>",

And that usually takes self-control, or the ability to resist temptation.</p><p>Think of self-control as the inner voice that keeps you from indulging in high-calorie food and prompts you to stick to your diet.</p><p>But having to constantly resist temptation can be exhausting and quickly use up the limited store of willpower you wake up with each day -- and which is at its lowest point at night when people typically need it most.</p><p>These steps can help you boost the self-control you need to lose weight.</p><p>Cravings are the enemy. They're usually a conditioned response. For instance, you smell the aroma of apple pie, the smell makes you want to eat it, and you grab a fork to act on that impulse. This is where the old saying, out of sight, out of mind, can help.</p><p>Scientists looked at people with high self-control and found that this ability was linked to avoiding -- rather than resisting -- temptation. This means making small but significant changes, such as altering the route you take to work to avoid passing a tempting bakery.</p><p>It's also important to avoid any activities that trigger your urge to eat. If watching TV goes hand-in-hand with snacking, limit TV time. Ditto if you usually munch while you surf the internet. Whenever you're facing a screen with free hands, replace eating with a non-food activity, like walking in place or knitting.</p><p>The third step is to reinforce self-control by writing out -- and constantly reminding yourself of -- the exact behaviors you're trying to change, noting the new behaviors needed to get there, and continually tracking your progress.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart Association has additional ideas to help you <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/WeightManagement/LosingWeight/Conquer-the-Craving---Learning-to-Resist-Temptation_UCM_427999_Article.jsp#.Wzghqy2ZOCQ\" target=\"_new\">conquer your cravings</a> in moments of weakness.</p>",

About half of the participants said they typically slept less than 6.3 hours a night.</p><p>The researchers noted a number of surprising findings. Most people who slept four hours or less performed as if they were almost nine years older, and the amount of sleep associated with the best test results was the same for all ages.</p><p>Reasoning and verbal abilities were two of the mental skills most strongly affected by sleep, while short-term memory was relatively unaffected by sleep patterns, the researchers said.</p><p>There was some evidence that even a single night's sleep can affect thinking abilities. Participants who slept more than usual the night before taking the tests did better than those who slept their usual amount or less.</p><p>The study was published Oct. 9 in the journal <i>Sleep</i>.</p><p>\"We really wanted to capture the sleeping habits of people around the entire globe. Obviously, there have been many smaller sleep studies of people in laboratories, but we wanted to find out what sleep is like in the real world,\" said study co-author Adrian Owen, a researcher in Cognitive Neuroscience and Imaging at the University of Western Ontario, Canada.</p><p>\"People who logged in gave us a lot of information about themselves. We had a fairly extensive questionnaire and they told us things like which medications they were on, how old they were, where they were in the world and what kind of education they'd received because these are all factors that might have contributed to some of the results,\" Owen explained in a university news release.</p><p>Study lead author Conor Wild, a research associate in Owen's lab, said, \"We found that the optimum amount of sleep to keep your brain performing its best is seven to eight hours every night, and that corresponds to what the doctors will tell you need to keep your body in tiptop shape, as well.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more on <a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Understanding-Sleep\" target=\"_new\">sleep</a>.</p>",

People whose noses have a lot of <i>Staphylococcus</i> bacteria had more severe nasal symptoms than those with less of this type of bacteria.</p><p>The bacteria inside the noses of the participants followed one of six different patterns, which were associated with variations in the severity of their symptoms. The mix of nasal bacteria was also linked with their viral load, or the amount of the virus in their body.</p><p>\"There were effects on virus load and how much virus you shed in your nasal secretions. So the background microbiome, the background bacterial pattern in your nose, had influences on the way that you reacted to the virus and how sick you got,\" said researcher Dr. Ronald Turner, who's with the University of Virginia School of Medicine. </p><p>But the researchers added that their findings don't prove a cause-and-effect relationship.</p><p>\"What we're reporting is an association, so it's entirely possible that the fact that you have staph in your nose and you have more symptoms is not directly related,\" Turner explained in a university news release. \"It may well be that there's some underlying host characteristic that makes you likely to have staph in your nose and also makes you more likely to become ill.\"</p><p>The researchers noted that the composition of nasal bacteria and the severity of people's symptoms could boil down to genetics.</p><p>\"Whether there are environmental characteristics that also influence it -- whether you're exposed to pollution or whether you're allergic or whether any number of things might impact it -- I don't know,\" Turner said. \"But I suspect there is some interaction among the host and the environment and the pathogen that determines what you end up with.\"</p><p>The study participants were also treated with probiotics to determine if beneficial bacteria would ease their symptoms or affect the composition of their nasal bacteria. Neither happened. It also didn't affect the microbiomes in their stomachs, Turner's team reported.</p><p>The researchers, who received funding from DuPont, the probiotic's manufacturer, suggested that a more direct approach, such as a probiotic nasal spray, could possibly have a more noticeable effect.</p><p>\"One of the things that would be interesting to ask, and this would be a completely different study, is, what happens if you give antibiotics?\" Turner said. \"Can you change the nasal flora by giving antibiotic? And is that a good thing or is that a bad thing? Those are all unknowns.\"</p><p>The findings were published recently in the journal <i>Scientific Reports</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides more on the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/features/rhinoviruses/index.html\" target=\"_new\">common cold</a>.</p>",

Risk of liver cancer was 59 percent lower among those who took aspirin regularly for five years or more.</p><p>The risk reduction declined after people stopped taking aspirin, however. And it disappeared altogether eight years after aspirin was discontinued, the findings showed.</p><p>Regular use of acetaminophen (Tylenol) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) was not linked to reduced risk of liver cancer, according to the study. The results were published Oct. 4 in <i>JAMA Oncology</i>.</p><p>The findings support results from previous studies, the researchers said. </p><p>However, Simon said additional research is still needed. \"Since regular aspirin use carries the risk of increased bleeding, the next step should be to study its impact in populations with established liver disease, since that group is already at risk for primary liver cancer,\" she said in a hospital news release.</p><p>Liver cancer is relatively rare, but it has increased in the United States over the past 40 years. Also, liver cancer death rates have risen faster than those of any other cancer, the researchers noted.</p><p> Senior study author Dr. Andrew Chan pointed out that \"aspirin use is already recommended for prevention of heart disease and colorectal cancer in certain U.S. adults.\" Chan is the hospital's chief of clinical and translational epidemiology unit.</p><p>\"These data also add to a growing list of cancers for which aspirin appears to have anti-cancer activity,\" he said in the news release.</p><p>This could be a rationale for more patients to discuss an aspirin regimen with their doctors, Chan said. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Cancer Society has more on <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/liver-cancer/about/what-is-liver-cancer.html\" target=\"_new\">liver cancer</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Oct. 29, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Children may suffer delayed language skills if their mothers come in contact with common chemicals called phthalates in early pregnancy, new research suggests.</p><p>Phthalates are in countless products from nail polish and hair spray to food packaging and vinyl flooring. As plasticizers, they make things more pliable; as solvents, they enable other substances to dissolve. </p><p>In the new study, researchers found that the risk for language delay at about age 3 years was up to 30 percent higher among children whose mothers had higher exposure to two phthalates in particular: dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP). Both chemicals are in products such as older vinyl flooring, cosmetics and plastic toys.</p><p>\"Phthalates are known to be hormonally active and affect the body's hormone system,\" said researcher Shanna Swan, a professor of environmental and public health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.</p><p>Although the study cannot prove these chemicals cause delays in language development, Swan believes there is good reason to think they do. </p><p>Both DBP and BBP have been shown to lower testosterone in the mother during early pregnancy, Swan said. That helps explain how they can affect intellectual development, she noted.</p><p>Phthalates previously have been linked to developmental delays, lower IQ and underdeveloped male sex organs, the researchers said. </p><p>Because they are so commonplace, \"we are all exposed all the time,\" said lead researcher Carl-Gustaf Bornehag, a professor at Karlstad University in Sweden.</p><p>DBP and BBP are banned in many products, but they have very long life cycles. For example, vinyl flooring can be used for 20 to 30 years, meaning people are exposed for a very long time, he said.</p><p>Also, phthalates are routinely detected in indoor air, dust, food and water because they leach into the air, according to background notes with the study.</p><p>Swan said the only way to avoid these chemicals is to buy products labeled phthalate-free or to carefully read label ingredients.</p><p>However, steering clear of the chemicals is easier said than done, Bornehag pointed out.</p><p>\"It is often hard to get information about chemicals in products and articles, which makes it difficult to avoid exposure. We need better labeling systems,\" he said. </p><p>And Swan added that  banned phthalates have been replaced by similarly troublesome chemicals. </p><p>\"Manufacturers have taken out the worst offenders and put in a slight change, which changes its name, but they are equally hormonally active,\" she said. \"There have been some substitutions.\" </p><p>According to Steven Gilbert, director of the Institute of Neurotoxicology and Neurological Disorders, in Seattle, the real issue is that chemicals put into everyday household products are not regulated. </p><p>They're only tested and potentially banned when a problem arises after years of use, he said. </p><p>\"What we need to do is change the laws,\" Gilbert said. \"We've shown that these are bad actors and they cause cell changes, and we just need to stop using them.\" </p><p>The study involved pregnant women and their children who took part in long-term studies in Sweden or the United States. Nearly 1,000 mothers were in Sweden; 370 were in the United States.</p><p>Parents were asked about how many words their kids understood at about 30 months to 37 months of age. Children who understood 50 or fewer words were said to have a language delay.</p><p>Overall, 10 percent had a language delay, boys more often than girls, the researchers found. </p><p>Urine samples collected from the mothers in the 10th week of pregnancy revealed a correlation between phthalate exposure and language delay, according to the study. </p><p>The researchers said the results were statistically significant in the Swedish study, but not in the U.S. study. They believe the difference is probably due to the U.S. study's smaller sample size.</p><p>The report was published online Oct. 29 in <i>JAMA Pediatrics</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more about phthalates, visit the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/Phthalates_FactSheet.html\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

It also showed daily use doubling between eighth and 12th grades.</p>  <p>Maturation of critical parts of the brain occurs in adolescence, and regular pot use in those years may cause more harm than later use, the researchers said in background notes. </p><p>Marijuana legalization proponents countered that the new study supports their contention that the effects of pot are temporary.</p><p>\"These conclusions are consistent with those of prior studies finding that cannabis exposure is not likely to be associated with any sort of permanent adverse impact on the brain or cognitive performance,\" said Paul Armentano, deputy director of NORML.</p><p>\"These findings dispute the long-standing 'stoner-stupid' stereotype and should help to assuage fears that cannabis' acute effects on behavior may persist long after drug ingestion, or that they may pose greater potential risks to the developing brain,\" Armentano said.</p><p>For their study, Schuster and her colleagues asked two-thirds of a group of 88 marijuana users ages 16 to 25 to drop pot for a month.</p><p>The Boston-area participants were not all heavy users, but did use regularly. \"We have kids using a minimum of one day a week or more,\" Schuster said.</p><p>Urine tests revealed that 9 out of 10 participants did follow through on their promise to stop using pot for the study period.</p><p>Once a week, the young people took part in computerized brain games that tested their attention and memory, to see if stopping their pot use would help improve their brain function.</p><p>The computer tests showed that memory -- specifically the ability to learn and recall new information -- improved only among those who stopped using cannabis. The improvement occurred largely during the first week.</p><p>The study only showed an association between quitting pot and better learning ability, not a direct cause-and-effect relationship. Still, specialists are taking note of the findings.</p><p>\"Cannabis use impacts learning and memory, and this study showed improvement in these domains after quitting,\" said Dr. Scott Krakower, assistant unit chief of psychiatry at Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks, N.Y.</p><p>\"This research may motivate practitioners to encourage their patients to quit using marijuana and maintain abstinence,\" Krakower said.</p><p>However, quitting marijuana did not appear to affect the participants' ability to pay attention. Both groups performed similarly in that area.</p><p>Future studies will test whether this memory recovery brings marijuana quitters back to full function by comparing them with teens who've never used in the first place, Schuster said.</p><p>\"What we don't know is, by that one week are they back to the levels of their non-using peers, or is there a deficit that's still measurable?\" Schuster said.</p><p>The study appears in the Oct. 30 <i>Journal of Clinical Psychiatry</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse has more about <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/what-are-marijuanas-long-term-effects-brain\" target=\"_new\">marijuana's long-term effects on the brain</a>.</p>",

He's clinical professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at the University of Miami. </p><p>Water appears to work its magic \"presumably via the flushing effect of increased urine volume, but there may be other effects we are not aware of,\" Hooton said in a university news release.</p><p>One specialist in women's health said the UTI-fighting benefits of hydrating with H2O have long been suspected, but not confirmed in a clinical trial until now.</p><p>\"Ask anyone who's had even one UTI, they are no fun,\" said Dr. Jill Rabin, who helps direct Women's Health Services at Northwell Health in New Hyde Park, N.Y. </p><p> \"In this study, women were included if they'd had three or more episodes in the prior year -- definitely painful and life-disrupting,\" noted Rabin, who wasn't involved in the new study. </p><p>\"Drinking more water to improve one's health is probably safe and, if tap is used, pretty inexpensive,\" she added. \"Producing additional urine -- and thus increasing voiding frequency  -- may raise one's awareness of the importance of keeping the bladder as empty as possible, which can help reduce UTIs.\" </p><p>The new trial included 140 younger, premenopausal women in Europe who had all experienced high numbers of recurrent UTIs. Their total daily fluid intake at the start of the study totaled less than six 8-ounce glasses per day.</p><p>During the year-long trial, half of the women drank just over six cups more each day of water, in addition to their regular daily fluid intake. Intake remained the same for the other half of women.</p><p>The reduction in UTI frequency for those who drank the additional water was significant. While  the average number of UTIs during the study period was 3.2  for women who did not increase their water intake, it fell to 1.7 for those women whose intake rose, the findings showed.</p><p>There was also a significant reduction in antibiotic use among the women who drank more water. Antibiotics are the main treatment of UTIs, and cutting down on the overuse of antibiotics is key to curbing the emergence of microbes resistant to the drugs.</p><p>Hooton said the trial was long overdue.</p><p>\"While it's been widely assumed that increased water intake helps to flush out bacteria and reduce the risk of recurrent UTI, there has been no supporting research data showing such a beneficial effect of water,\" he said.</p><p>The study did not determine the ideal amount of daily water intake to reduce the risk of UTIs, or whether boosting water intake would help women who are at a lower risk of recurrent UTIs than the group chosen for this trial.</p><p>Dr. Elizabeth Kavaler is a urology specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. She said the trial highlights the notion that \"water is the preferred beverage for overall bladder and kidney health.\" She added that \"the amount that we each need depends on the environment, activity level and diet.\"</p><p>The study was published online Oct. 1 in <i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i>.

He's an epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital's division of sleep and circadian disorders, in Boston.</p><p>Compared to eight-hour-a-night sleepers, those who averaged less than six hours a night were twice as likely to say they had smoked cigarettes, used alcohol, marijuana or other drugs, or had driven after  drinking. They were also three times more likely to consider or attempt suicide, and almost twice as likely to carry a weapon or to fight, the researchers found.</p><p>\"Many of these behaviors are common precursors to accidents and suicides, which are the leading causes of death for teens in the U.S.,\" added Weaver. </p><p>The findings are based on an analysis of 2007-2015 data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveys. Nearly 68,000 high schoolers were involved in all. About 6 in 10 were white, and they attended public and private schools.</p><p>The researchers found that less than one-third of the students were getting eight or more hours of sleep on weeknights. Twenty-two percent said they logged about six hours daily, while about 18 percent reported less than six hours of sleep on average.</p><p>Weaver cautioned, however, that while the survey suggests \"an association between sleep and these behaviors,\" it cannot prove cause and effect. It's possible that kids who engage in risky behavior may undermine the quantity and quality of their sleep, rather than the other way around, he said.</p><p>Also, because the information was self-reported, it might not be completely reliable.</p><p>Nevertheless, Weaver said it's critical to ensure that teens get enough sleep.</p><p>\"Insufficient sleep in youth raises multiple public health concerns, including mental health, substance abuse, and motor vehicle crashes,\" he said. He added that more research is needed to determine the specific relationships between sleep and these behaviors.</p><p>Parents can help, Weaver noted. Be aware of what time homework and other activities must end so kids can get eight to 10 hours in bed.</p><p>\"Limiting the use of [electronic] devices at night can also be helpful. These activities are engaging and tend to lead to later bedtimes,\" he added.</p><p>The study findings appear in a letter to the editor in the Oct. 1 issue of <i>JAMA Pediatrics</i>.</p><p>Dr. Nathaniel Watson is a professor of neurology at the University of Washington Medicine Sleep Center in Seattle.</p><p>\"The single best way to address this problem is to delay school start times,\" said Watson, past president of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.</p><p>\"Adolescent physiology is such that bedtimes before 11 p.m. can be difficult,\" he said. \"So later school start times allow a bedtime of 11 p.m., and at least eight hours of sleep.\"</p><p>Watson advised parents to attend school board meetings to push for later school start times. Starting at 8:30 a.m. or after would benefit student health and well-being, he added.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on teens and sleep at the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072503/\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institutes of Health</a>.</p>",

Productivity starts to fall considerably after the 50th work hour of the week and gets worse with every additional hour. So, if you put in 70 hours a week, you're not likely to accomplish anything worthwhile during those last 15.</p><p>One reason for this is that you might be too stressed or tired to function at peak level since working overtime usually results in your getting less sleep -- and that in turn leads to making mistakes that can set you back at work.</p><p>Take action to improve the balance between your personal life and your work life. Prioritize responsibilities and focus on the most important ones. Assert more control over time-draining tasks like answering emails.

For most of us, dry skin makes an appearance in the winter due to changes in temperature and humidity, so you need to think about appropriate skin care formulations,\" said Dr.  Rajani Katta.

Creams are a better choice for those with dry skin,\" Katta said in a university news release.</li><li><b>Use sunblock.</b> Rogge explained that \"even when the temperature drops, the sun's rays can still emit powerful ultraviolet radiation. If you're close to snow or water, those UV rays can be even more potent due to the reflective surfaces, which makes wearing protection paramount.\"</li><li><b>Don't take long, hot showers.</b>  \"Many of us love to linger longer in steaming hot showers, particularly when it's cold outside. These feel great, especially when your skin is itchy,\" Rogge added. \"But this can actually damage your skin barrier, and also exacerbate dry, itchy skin. That's why it's recommended to limit showers to 10 minutes, and use lukewarm water instead of hot water.\"</li><li><b>Soak and smear to help lock moisture into your skin.</b> Katta said, \"After soaking your skin, you want to smear on your moisturizer. In other words, after you take a shower, you'll step out of the shower, pat dry just a little bit, then apply a moisturizer while your skin is still damp.\"</li><li><b>Wear gloves.</b> \"An important part of looking after your skin is using the right protective gear,\" Katta noted. \"Gloves keep your fingers warm and protect them, too.\" </li><li><b>Use a humidifier in your home.</b> According to Rogge, \"Winter dry skin gets worse once you start turning on the heat in your home.

The patient is now in isolation, the wire service reported.</p><p>Mikael Kohler, chief medical officer for the Uppsala region, said the patient visited \"mostly urban areas in Burundi, where there isn't thought to be any active Ebola as far as we know.\"</p><p>However, upon arrival at the hospital in Enkoping the patient displayed symptoms of Ebola infection, including vomiting blood, Kohler said.  Test results are expected by 12 p.m. ET, he added.</p><p>The emergency room where the patient was cared for has been closed, and any staff who had contact with the patient are being monitored, officials said.</p><p>Ebola is caused by a virus and can cause fever, hemorrhaging and severe headaches. It is fatal in about half of cases.</p><p>There's an outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which borders Burundi, with case numbers topping 600 by Wednesday, <i>CNN</i> reported.  The largest Ebola outbreak occurred in 2014 in West Africa and claimed more than 11,000 lives.</p><p>In related news, Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha is currently monitoring an American who was potentially exposed to Ebola whole providing medical assistance in the Congo, <i>CNN</i> said.</p><p>In a Dec. 29 statement, Dr. Ted Cieslak, an infectious disease specialist at the medical center,  said \"the person may have been exposed to the virus but is not ill and is not contagious.\"</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Social Media Tied to Depression in Teens, Especially Girls</b></span></p><p>Using social media for five hours or more per day is tied to a big jump in risk for depression among 14-year-olds, and especially for girls, a new British study shows.</p><p>As compared to girls who spent just one to three hours daily on social media, girls who spent five or more hours on Snapchat, Instagram and the like had 50 percent higher odds for depressive symptoms, says a team from University College London.</p><p>The number was somewhat less for boys -- a 35 percent hike in risk for boys who used social media five-plus hours per day.</p><p>\"We were quite surprised when we saw the figures and we saw those raw percentages: the fact that the magnitude of association was so much larger for girls than for boys,\" study author Yvonne Kelly, a professor of epidemiology and public health at the university, told <i>CNN</i>.</p><p>The researchers stressed that the study couldn't prove that excessive social media use caused depressive symptoms, only that there was an association. Depressive symptoms included feelings of loneliness, unhappiness or restlessness.</p><p>The researchers looked at data from a national study that included nearly 11,000 British 14-year-olds born between 2000 and 2002.</p><p>The data showed that girls were typically on social media more than boys: about 43 percent of girls used social media three or more hours per day, compared to about 22 percent of boys.</p><p>\"For both girls and boys, the more social media they use, the more likely they are to have mental health problems, but not that many studies have been able to look for the explanations why,\" Kelly told <i>CNN</i>.</p><p>\"We looked at four potential explanations simultaneously, and this is the first paper to do that. We looked at sleeping habits; experiences online, so cyberbullying; how they thought about their bodies, or their body image, and whether they were happy with how they looked; and their self-esteem,\" she explained.</p><p>\"All of those four things -- the sleep, the cyberharassment, the body image or happiness with appearance, and the self-esteem -- they are all linked with the risk of having depression,\" Kelly said.</p><p>She noted that girls tend to gravitate towards Instagram and Snapchat. Those platforms are \"more based around physical appearance, taking photographs and commenting on those photographs,\" she said, so the stronger link between social media and depression in girls may have \"to do with the nature of use.\"</p><p>The findings were published Jan. 3 in <i>EClinicalMedicine</i>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 16, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Comfort-inducing seasonal drinks abound during the fall and winter. From the sweet, spicy goodness of pumpkin spice latte -- PSL to its fans on Instagram -- to peppermint-flavored, well, everything. </p> <p>But the calories are everywhere, too.  </p> <p>And, experts say, those liquid calories can be more problematic than the ones we get from solid food. Some studies have shown that we feel less full from liquid calories, so we may consume more than we should.</p> <p>\"We are less sensitive to liquid calories than we are to solid calories,\" said Marie-Pierre St-Onge, an associate professor of nutritional medicine at Columbia University. \"The calories from solid food tend to produce greater signals for fullness, making it easier to adjust our caloric intakes. With liquids, those signals are weaker and that's how you can get into trouble in terms of overconsumption.\"</p> <p>Just one 16-ounce pumpkin spice latte with 2 percent milk and whipped cream contains about 380 calories, with 14 grams of fat and a whopping 50 grams of sugar.</p> <p>It's not just a PSL problem. All sorts of seasonal drinks pack in the calories, from peppermint mocha, chai latte and sugary apple cider to eggnog and warmed-up cocktails. Alcohol, though, also lowers inhibitions, which can lead to overeating  among other unhealthy behaviors.</p> <p>Spices and flavors such as peppermint, pumpkin, ginger, cloves or cinnamon can give almost any drink a seasonal twist. The challenge is finding a drink that's healthy on its own, with or without the spices.</p> <p>\"Pumpkin spice is virtually no calories, it's one or two calories,\" said Judith Wylie-Rosett, a professor and division head for health promotion and nutrition research at New York's Albert Einstein College of Medicine. But when you put in syrups and milk, \"the latte can be very high in calories.\" </p> <p>Some ways to make traditional cold-weather favorites a little healthier: </p> <ul> <li>Ask your barista for fewer pumps of syrup  one instead of three  or simply use spices instead of flavored syrup if making your own drink at home.</li> <li>Use plant-based or low-fat milk instead of whole or condensed milk.</li> <li>Choose black coffee or espresso instead of a milky latte, then add spices to create seasonal flavors.</li> <li>Buy hot chocolate mix without vegetable oil.</li> <li>Skip the whipped cream on top.</li> </ul> <p>Generally, homemade drinks tend to be healthier, St-Onge said, because you're able to control how much sweetener you put in. </p> <p>Milk can be an important ingredient because it adds vitamin D, which is needed in the fall and winter months as days become shorter and colder and as people spend less time exercising outside. So, choosing fat-free or low-fat milk over whole milk as an ingredient is one easy solution.</p> <p>There are other sources of vitamin D as well. St-Onge said fall and winter are good times to experiment with putting fruits and vegetables  as well as seasonal spices  into smoothies, although she cautioned that people may not get all the health benefits of foods when they're liquefied. </p> <p>Regardless of the season, St-Onge said, people shouldn't look to drinks as a source of energy. </p> <p>\"The calories from solid food tend to produce greater signals for fullness, making it easier to adjust our caloric intakes. With liquids, those signals are weaker and that's how you can get into trouble in terms of overconsumption.\"</p> <p>Research shows to get the cozy effect of a typical cold-weather drink, you may not even have to consume it at all. A University of Colorado study a decade ago found people who hold warm beverages are judged as having a warmer personality.</p> <p>\"The feelings of warmth when one holds a hot cup of coffee or takes a warm bath might activate memories of other feelings associated with warmth (trust and comfort),\" researchers wrote, \"because of early experiences with caretakers who provide warmth, shelter, safety, and nourishment.\"</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Oct. 19, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Gerard Blaney figured his excruciating headache was simply due to a combination of too much stress and too little food. It was budget season at Einstein Healthcare Network in Philadelphia, and as the network's chief financial officer, his entire lunch that day in April 2016 consisted of a single pretzel.</p> <p>He arrived home that evening hungry, hurting and harried.</p> <p>\"He looked awful,\" said his wife, Mariann.</p> <p>Hoping food would help him feel better, the couple and their then-23-year-old daughter, Chelsea, headed to a restaurant. But as soon as they were seated, Gerard put his head down on the table. His bad headache was worse, he was sweating and the burning that had been in his chest was now in his throat. Before they could even place their orders, he told his family that he needed to go home.</p> <p>Although Gerard had driven to the restaurant, he handed the keys to Mariann and climbed into the back seat to lie down. Mariann figured he was suffering from an allergy-related headache and prepared to drive home.</p> <p>\"Mom, whatever you do, don't go home,\" Chelsea whispered.</p> <p>Chelsea suggested going to a hospital. Mariann agreed. Gerard did, too, but on one condition: The only place he would go was Einstein, where he'd worked for 35 years. But it was 40 minutes away.</p> <p>Mariann agreed, although she also formulated a Plan B.</p> <p>\"I was prepared to call 911 if I had to,\" she said.</p> <p>Fortunately, the backup plan was not needed. When they arrived, a team of health professionals was waiting, and they whisked away her husband.</p> <p>Cardiologist Dr. Lynn Morris evaluated Gerard and broke the news to him. He was having a heart attack.</p> <p>\"I'm not having a heart attack,\" Gerard said.</p> <p>\"Yes, you are,\" Morris said. \"I know a little more than you.\"</p> <p> Even though an older brother had recently had a heart attack, Gerard didn't consider himself at risk. He never smoked and rarely drank. He exercised regularly and had been taking cholesterol-lowering medicine for years. Plus, he wasn't experiencing typical heart attack symptoms such as arm or chest pain.</p> <p>\"It was probably hard-headedness on my side,\" he said. \"When they're going to rush you right into the emergency room and you're only 59 years old and think you're in pretty good health, it's hard to accept that you're having a heart attack.\"</p> <p>Morris found the \"culprit artery\" and was able to open the blockage. In doing so, he noticed more disease in another artery, prompting coronary bypass surgery days later.</p> <p>About three weeks after the heart attack, Gerard was back at work, though in a limited capacity. Soon after, he was able to attend the graduation of his younger daughter, Cailin, from Penn State University.</p> <p>Today, Gerard exercises more and tries to eat better, opting for turkey burgers instead of hamburgers. And while he is still swamped with work, he's picked up one additional responsibility: chair of the Philadelphia Heart Walk on Oct. 27.</p> <p>Gerard said the information he's received preparing for the American Heart Association's flagship event has helped not only him, but his extended family as well. Now he hopes to help others remain heart-healthy, too.</p> <p>\"The big moral of the story is, if you have symptoms and aren't feeling right, you have to get to the doctor,\" he said.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 21, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Does your teenager's personality actually predict how long he or she will live?</p><p>Yes, claims new research that finds high school students who tend to be calm, empathetic and intellectually curious are more likely to still be alive 50 years later than their peers who are less so.</p><p>The finding does not prove that certain traits in adolescence actually cause people to live longer; it only reveals an association between the two.</p><p>But the conclusion stems from an in-depth analysis of personality surveys conducted in 1960,  involving nearly 27,000 high school students across the United States. Those results were then stacked up against participant deaths due to all causes over nearly 50 years.</p><p>\"Essentially, we find that high school students who report adaptive personality characteristics -- things like high levels of calmness and low levels of impulsivity -- have a lower risk of death over the ensuing half century,\" said study author Benjamin Chapman. He is an associate professor in the departments of psychiatry and public health sciences at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.</p><p>In addition to calmness and impulsivity, the initial survey gauged teenage levels of social sensitivity;  leadership; energetic disposition; self-confidence; tidiness; sociability; intellectual curiosity; and maturity.</p><p>Chapman said his team \"looked initially at each trait one by one.\" That meant that calmness was linked to a reduced risk of early death, whether or not the same teen also possessed other protective or risky traits.</p><p>Still, \"adolescents who are more sociable tended also to be more self-confident, and so forth,\" he observed, suggesting that some traits tend to group together in the same person.</p><p>Chapman also noted that personality traits were assessed on a spectrum, so that each teen was characterized as having relatively high or low levels of a particular trait. And that meant that the degree to which a teenage trait was associated with a lower premature death risk also fell across a continuum.</p><p>For example, highly mature teens saw their long-term risk for an early death fall by about 6 percent for every statistically significant move up along the maturity spectrum; it fell by 8 percent for every notable bump in calmness and energetic disposition.</p><p>Bigger trait differences would likely produce even more dramatic protective benefits, the study authors suggested.</p><p>The findings were published online Nov. 20  in the <i>Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health</i>.</p><p>The initial personality survey asked more than 377,000 high schoolers to complete a battery of psychological tests back in 1960.</p><p>Death records dating up to 2009 were obtained for nearly 27,000 of them. By that point, 13 percent had died. The team did not assess specific causes of death.</p><p>And regardless of a teen's ethnic or family background, those who scored higher in terms of energy, empathy, calmness, tidiness, intellectual curiosity and maturity -- as well as lower for impulsivity -- faced a lower risk of death over the 48-year period.</p><p>\"The insight of this work is that characteristics that we think are not particularly helpful in teens for immediate outcomes -- like getting good grades, getting into college, adjusting socially and emotionally to everyday life -- actually can have very long-term health consequences,\" said Chapman.</p><p>\"The good news is that people can and often do change,\" he added. \"There are many points in life between high school and a half-century later where chains of negative events can be halted or reversed in a sense.\"</p><p>Kit Yarrow is professor emeritus of psychology at Golden Gate University in San Francisco. She suggested the findings make intuitive sense.</p><p>\"Human connection is strongly correlated with health and happiness, so it's no surprise that those with more empathy -- our social glue -- would fare better,\" she said.</p><p>\"Meanwhile, impulsivity is dangerous,\" Yarrow added. \"[And] people with stronger personal control are more likely to avoid substances and reckless behavior which are detrimental to health.\"</p><p>By contrast, \"a calmer, more mature person will make better lifestyle choices that have long-reaching consequences,\" she said.</p><p>William Chopik, an assistant professor of psychology at Michigan State University, agreed that personality drives the everyday health decisions that ultimately impact longevity.</p> <p>\"Personality is pervasive in predicting everything about us,\" he said. \"Who we think we are, what we achieve, the type of job we have, how we deal with stress, whether our relationships last. And now, thanks to this and other research projects, how long we live.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on mental outlook and health at the <a href=\"https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2015/08/positive-emotions-your-health\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institutes of Health</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Oct. 22, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The U.S. Drug and Food Administration has repeatedly warned manufacturers that many dietary supplements contain dangerous, experimental stimulants. But according to a new report, 75 percent of supplements tested still contain the  compounds.</p><p>\"Consumers turn to supplements for safe, natural ways to increase energy, improve workouts or lose weight,\" said study author Dr. Pieter Cohen, an associate professor with Harvard Medical School. \"[But] what most consumers don't know is that supplements can be sold as if they give you energy, help you lose weight or just about anything, as long as the supplement does not claim to cure or treat disease.\"</p><p>His team's findings centered on four unapproved stimulants: DMAA, DMBA, BMPEA and oxilofrine.</p><p>The four have become replacements for the stimulant ephedra, which the FDA banned from supplements in 2004 following reports that it raised the risk for heart attack, stroke and death.</p><p>Between 2013 and 2016, the FDA found that 12 different supplement brands contained one or more of the four unapproved stimulants. But despite public notice warnings from the agency, three-quarters of the supplements still contained at least one prohibited stimulant in 2017. And half contained two or more.</p><p>The finding raises fresh concerns about supplement safety, and comes on the heels of another troubling analysis published just last week by the California Department of Public Health's Food and Drug Branch.</p><p>That investigation revealed that the FDA had issued more than 700 warnings over the last decade about potentially hazardous ingredients found in supplements promoted as sexual, weight-loss and muscle growth aids.</p><p>But because the FDA classifies dietary supplements as a food -- rather than as drugs -- supplement manufacturers do not have to prove a supplement is safe or effective before selling it to the public.</p><p>If, however, the FDA ultimately determines that a supplement already on the market is potentially hazardous, it can recall the product or issue a \"public notice\" concerning problematic ingredients.</p><p>In a letter published online Oct. 22 in the journal <i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i>, Cohen and his colleagues point to an earlier study that suggests that FDA recalls, for one, are largely ineffective.</p><p>The latest investigation focused on the effectiveness of public notice warnings, and found equally poor results.</p><p>\"The FDA seems to imagine that if they simply request that firms remove an experimental stimulant from commerce, the stimulant will be removed,\" Cohen said. \"Clearly this is wishful thinking on the part of the FDA.\"</p><p>Cohen noted that he and his associates conducted two analyses of 12 supplements previously issued public notices for unapproved ingredients.</p><p>The first analysis took place in 2014. At that time, all 12 supplements contained at least one of the four prohibited stimulants.</p><p>The second analysis took place in 2017. At that point, nine of the 12 brands contained at least one prohibited supplement and six contained two.</p><p>The team also pointed out that although DMBA had not been found in any of the 12 supplements in 2014, it <i>was</i> found in a third of the supplements in 2017, two years <i>after</i> the FDA issued a public notice raising concern about the ingredient.</p><p>\"Until the law is reformed and the FDA aggressively enforces the law, these potentially dangerous ingredients will likely remain in supplements,\" said Cohen.</p><p>Dr. Mitchell Katz is president and CEO of NYC Health and Hospitals in New York City, and author of an accompanying editorial. He suggested that the upshot is that the FDA is hamstrung in what it can do.</p><p>\"The FDA is not allowed by federal law to investigate a product before it is marketed,\" Katz noted. \"Therefore, all that the FDA can do under current law is respond to complaints and issue guidelines of what can and cannot be in supplements.\"</p><p>The bottom line, said Katz, is that \"people should know that the supplements they are taking are not tested [and] may contain substances that are not on the label.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on supplement regulations at <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/food/dietarysupplements\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Oct. 2, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The most dangerous play in football can be rendered safer through a simple rule change, a new study out of the Ivy League suggests.</p><p>Moving the kickoff line forward by just five yards -- from the 35- to the 40-yard line -- reduced the average annual concussion rate in Ivy League football by more than 68 percent, the study revealed.</p><p>That change makes players less likely to run the ball forward, eliminating the potential for high-speed collisions during kickoff returns, said study author Douglas Wiebe, director of the Penn Injury Science Center at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>\"At the end of the day, the results are really quite compelling,\" Wiebe said.</p><p>Kickoff returns account for more concussions than any other play in football.</p><p>In 2015, kickoffs accounted for 6 percent of all plays during a game but 21 percent of all concussions in the Ivy League, the researchers said.</p><p>Statistics compiled by the National Football League (NFL) show that concussions are five times more likely to happen during kickoffs, <i>ESPN</i> has reported.</p><p>\"Players on the receiving team have the time and space to get up to full speed running forward. Players on the team that just kicked the ball are running at full speed toward them,\" Wiebe said. \"High-speed high-impact collisions are just quite likely to occur during this type of play, relative to other types of play.\"</p><p>Because of this, the Ivy League in 2016 decided to move the kickoff line forward five yards.</p><p>\"The rationale is it would give the kickers a better chance for the ball to reach or go beyond the end zone,\" Wiebe said. \"Players would be more likely to take a knee rather than move the ball forward.\"</p><p>Kickoffs happen frequently during a football game, including at the start of each half and after a scoring play.</p><p>One team kicks the ball to the other. The receiving team tries to get the football as far back down field as possible, while the opposing team tries to tackle the ball carrier as quickly as possible.</p><p>But if the kicked ball goes past the goal line, the receiving team can decide to \"take a knee\" and down the ball in what is called a \"touchback.\" Play then starts with the ball placed at a set position on the field, which in the Ivy League is the 20-yard line.</p><p>Ivy League coaches asked for the kickoff line to be moved forward, likely with the idea that more kicks would go past the goal line and more ball receivers would take a touchback instead of running the ball forward, said co-researcher Bernadette D'Alonzo, a clinical research coordinator with Penn Injury Science.</p><p>Results from the 2016 and 2017 seasons show that the rule change paid off, the study authors noted.</p><p>Kickoff plays resulting in a touchback increased from an average 18 percent annually to 48 percent after the rule change, meaning fewer instances of high-speed collisions, the researchers reported.</p><p>As a result, the rate of concussions during kickoff plays went from 10.9 per 1,000 plays down to 2 per 1,000 plays, Wiebe said.</p><p>To make sure this was the result of the rule change, the researchers compared kickoffs to a control group consisting of all other football plays during the season.</p><p>They found that for other play types, the concussion rate went from 2.5 per 1,000 down to 1.2 per 1,000 following the rule change.</p><p>\"Over time, there was a small reduction in the rate of concussion in other play types, but after pulling that out and accounting for it, we still see that evidently the kickoff rule appears to explain there was a reduction in kickoff return concussions to the tune of 7.5 fewer per 1,000,\" Wiebe said.</p><p>The NFL already moved its own kickoff line forward in 2011, from the 30- to the 35-yard line, in an attempt to limit concussions, the researchers noted. One analysis concluded that the NFL's change reduced injuries overall but not head injuries, but the prior study did not compare kickoffs against all other play types.</p><p>The NFL is considering eliminating the kickoff altogether if it can't be made safer, <i>ESPN</i> has reported.</p><p>The Ivy League study is \"great news,\" said Kristen Dams-O'Connor, director of the Brain Injury Research Center at Mount Sinai, in New York City.</p><p>\"This is a really great example of how this much-loved sport can be made safer,\" Dams-O'Connor said.</p><p>Another sports safety expert agreed.</p><p>The rule change makes a great deal of sense, given how dangerous kickoff plays can be, said Dr. Michael Stuart, co-director of sports medicine at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minn.</p><p>\"When I played football, we were taught on kickoffs on punts that you had to play with reckless abandon, complete disregard for personal safety,\" Stuart said. \"You had to run as fast as you could down the field and knock anyone out of the way who was trying to block you, and try to be the first one to the kickoff returner and tackle them at high speed.\"</p><p>However, Stuart noted that even on touchbacks, the rest of the team still is running toward each other at full tilt until they get word the play has ended.</p><p>\"Clearly, the kickoff returner is not at risk of concussion, but the other 21 players can still be involved in high-speed contacts. That's an important recognition,\" Stuart said, adding that any discussion of potentially abandoning kickoffs should weigh this fact.</p><p>The findings were published online Oct. 1 as a research letter in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about <a href=\" https://www.cdc.gov/headsup/youthsports/index.html\" target=\"_new\">sports-related concussions</a>.</p>",

But the rates of infection were seven times higher in people with diabetes, she added.</p><p>The rise in overall infections is largely driven by increases in patients who develop sepsis while in the hospital, Harding said. \"However, we also see in people with diabetes an increase in foot ulcers, coinciding with an increase in lower limb amputations,\"  she added.</p><p>Dr. Louis Philipson, director of the University of Chicago Kovler Diabetes Center, said it isn't clear why diabetics develop more infections.</p><p>\"We do not even have data as to whether the infections occurred in people with more poorly controlled diabetes, though that seems like a reasonable guess,\" said Philipson, who is also  president-elect for medicine and science at the American Diabetes Association.</p><p>High blood sugar decreases the activity of the immune system and can cause many changes in tissue, skin and blood flow, all of which can increase the risk of infections, Philipson said.  </p><p>\"Exactly which factors are most important here, and whether access to health care played a role, we do not know yet,\" he added.</p><p>Urinary tract, skin and connective tissue infections are associated with high blood sugar levels and poorly controlled diabetes, Philipson explained. Preventing diabetes and reaching the optimum targets for blood sugar control are key to reducing infections.</p><p>\"Along with that, regular visits to a primary care doctor and specialist as needed to get the best foot care, eye care and review of kidney function will go a long way towards preventing complications of diabetes,\" Philipson said.</p><p>For the study, Harding and her colleagues used national hospitalization data from 2000 to 2015. The data captured about 20 percent of all hospitalizations in 46 states, representing more than 96 percent of the U.S. population.</p><p>The investigators found that people with diabetes are about two to seven times more likely to be hospitalized with an infection than the general population.</p><p>\"Improved access to preventive care, as well as promoting education to reduce risk factors for underlying disease processes, will be essential to decrease the risk of infections in people with diabetes,\" Harding said.</p><p>Dr. Joel Zonszein directs the Clinical Diabetes Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. He  said it's concerning that the majority of patients with diabetes are not treated properly, since high blood sugar levels predispose them to infections.</p><p>\"We have proper ways to treat diabetes, and there should be no excuse why patients shouldn't be getting the best care,\" he said. \"More research is not needed -- more effective treatment is imperative.\"</p><p>The results of the study were scheduled for presentation Tuesday at the meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, in Berlin. Research presented at medical meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/type-2/\" target=\"_new\"> American Diabetes Association</a> for more on type 2 diabetes.</p>",

But why are blacks more likely to develop high blood pressure?</p><p>The new study suggests the key factor is the traditional Southern diet -- with its deep-fried foods, pecan pies and other tasty but nutritionally dubious fare.</p><p>In fact, the diet explained more than half the excess risk of high blood pressure among black men, versus white men. Among women, the eating pattern was less important, but still explained almost 30 percent of the disparity between black and white women, according to the findings.</p><p>Diet has a critical effect on blood pressure, regardless of race, said lead researcher George Howard, of the University of Alabama at Birmingham.</p><p>But this study, he said, shows that it accounts for much of the black-white racial disparity in high blood pressure.</p><p>\"We were absolutely surprised by how important this factor was,\" Howard said.</p><p>And that can be seen as good news, he added.</p><p>\"Diet is something you can change,\" Howard pointed out. \"This is not all because of underlying genetics or other factors you can't change.\"</p><p>The research is based on nearly 6,900 older U.S. adults who were followed for roughly nine years. At the outset, they were 62 years old, on average, and free of high blood pressure.</p><p>By the end of the study, 46 percent of black participants had been diagnosed with high blood pressure, versus one-third of whites.</p><p>When Howard's team looked for explanations for the discrepancy, they found that the Southern diet seemed to be the single most important one.</p><p>The impact was clearer among men. There was no major difference in body mass index (BMI) or waist size between black and white men, Howard said. On the other hand, Southern-style eating explained 52 percent of the racial disparity in high blood pressure risk.</p><p>The picture was somewhat different for women. Black women had a higher average BMI and waist size than white women -- and those were two key factors in their higher blood pressure. (BMI is a measure of weight in relation to height.)</p><p>However, the Southern diet explained 29 percent of the racial disparity in women's risk of high blood pressure.</p><p>The diet mattered independent of any effects on weight and belt size. So its nutritional components may bear much of the blame, according to the researchers.</p><p>Besides deep-fried fare, the traditional Southern diet is heavy in processed meats, eggs, high-fat dairy, sugary treats and bread.</p><p>\"There's no doubt the Southern diet is like a sodium pill,\" said Howard, adding he grew up on it himself.</p><p>On top of that, he said, it's lacking in the fruits and vegetables, fiber-rich grains, healthy fats and other foods that help keep the heart and blood vessels healthy.</p><p> The study was published Oct. 2 in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>. </p><p>Cordialis Msora-Kasago is a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. She, too, was surprised by the findings.</p><p>\"The figures were really striking,\" Msora-Kasago said. \"And this is good news, because diet can be modified.\"</p><p>That does not mean people have to abandon comfort foods to become vegetarians, added Msora-Kasago, who was not involved with the study.</p><p>\"The Southern diet isn't just an eating pattern,\" she said. \"It's called 'soul food,' because it's part of a culture and tradition.\"</p><p>Fortunately, she said, it's possible to make healthier versions of Southern favorites. People can cut down on salt, and season with herbs and spices instead. They can reduce the amount of meat in dishes, and add more vegetables.</p><p>\"It's important that the changes fit into a person's lifestyle so they are sustainable,\" Msora-Kasago said.</p><p>African-Americans are at \"extraordinary risk\" of heart disease and stroke, Howard said, noting that's largely due to high blood pressure.</p><p>\"So preventing high blood pressure,\" he said, \"is the key to reducing that disparity.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has advice on <a href=\"https://www.eatright.org/food\" target=\"_new\">making healthier meals</a>.</p>",

The findings showed that while the average life span of black and yellow Labrador Retrievers is 12  years, the median life span of chocolate Labs was at least 10 percent shorter than that. </p><p>Compared with their counterparts, chocolate Labs were also two times more likely to have ear inflammation and four times more likely to have a skin condition called hot spot.</p><p>The findings came as a surprise, said lead study author Paul McGreevy, a professor at the University of Sydney, in Australia.</p><p>\"The relationships between coat color and disease may reflect an inadvertent consequence of breeding certain pigmentations,\" McGreevy said in a university news release.</p><p>\"Because chocolate color is recessive in dogs, the gene for this color must be present in both parents for their puppies to be chocolate. Breeders targeting this color may therefore be more likely to breed only Labradors carrying the chocolate coat gene,\" he explained.</p><p>\"It may be that the resulting reduced gene pool includes a higher proportion of genes conducive to ear and skin conditions,\" McGreevy added.</p><p>Among all Labs in the study, the most common health problems were obesity, ear infections and joint conditions.</p><p>Nearly 9 percent of the Labradors in the study were overweight or obese, one of the highest percentages among dog breeds.

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Oct. 25, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The wave of marijuana legalization that's swept across the United States in recent years has been fueled in part by the popular belief that pot is essentially harmless.</p><p>But a new study shows that some heavy users will experience withdrawal symptoms while coming down from their high.</p><p>About 1 in 10 frequent cannabis users reports symptoms like anxiety, hostility, insomnia and depression after the intoxicating effects of weed start to wear off, said senior researcher Deborah Hasin, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.</p><p>These folks might be using pot to help treat their anxiety or depression, unaware that they're putting the cart before the horse, Hasin said.</p><p>\"There's a lot of overlap between the symptoms of cannabis withdrawal and the symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorders,\" Hasin said. \"People may actually mistakenly feel that cannabis is helping a depression or an anxiety disorder, when what's happening in reality is they're perpetuating a withdrawal syndrome. Using cannabis makes the symptoms go away, but it's not a good solution to it.\"</p><p>Advocates of marijuana legalization acknowledge that pot can cause withdrawal symptoms, but point out that its addictive potential is far less than other products that have been legally available to consumers for decades.</p><p>\"The fact that these withdrawal symptoms are relatively mild and short-lived is one of the reasons why cannabis possesses a far lower dependence liability than most other controlled substances, including alcohol and tobacco,\" said Paul Armentano, deputy director of NORML, a group advocating for reform of marijuana laws.</p><p>\"For instance, the profound physical withdrawal effects associated with tobacco are so severe that many subjects who strongly desire to quit end up reinitiating their use,\" Armentano explained. </p><p>\"In the case of alcohol, the abrupt ceasing of use in heavy users can be so severe that it can lead to death. Simply withdrawing from caffeine can lead to a number of adverse side effects, like rebound headaches,\" he said.</p><p>At this point, 30 states have laws that legalize marijuana in some form. Nine states and Washington, D.C., have made pot legal for recreational use, while the rest allow for use of medical marijuana.</p><p>To test the notion that pot is harmless, Hasin and her colleagues analyzed data gathered by a 2012-2013 federal survey on health problems caused by alcohol and other substance use. During the survey, federal researchers conducted face-to-face interviews with more than 36,000 participants across the United States.</p><p>The new study focused specifically on responses from more than 1,500 survey participants who reported using pot three or more times a week during the previous year, Hasin said. They were considered frequent or heavy marijuana users.</p><p>About 12 percent of heavy pot users reported symptoms that align with those of cannabis withdrawal syndrome, a condition outlined in DSM-5, a diagnostic manual produced by the American Psychiatric Association.</p><p>These included nervousness or anxiety (76 percent), hostility (72 percent), sleep difficulty (68 percent) and depressed mood (59 percent), researchers reported.</p><p>Physical symptoms were reported less frequently, but heavy users were more likely to experience headaches, shakiness or tremors, and sweating, the study found.</p><p>People with a history of mood or personality disorders had a greater risk for experiencing withdrawal symptoms, Hasin said.</p><p>Frequency of use within a week was not significantly associated with withdrawal symptoms, but the number of joints smoked per day did make a difference, researchers found.</p><p>Smoking six or more joints per day was associated with cannabis withdrawal syndrome, while smoking five or fewer joints per day was not.</p><p>\"If people are using cannabis frequently and they're experiencing these symptoms, they should really consider cutting down on their use, at least to see what happens,\" Hasin said.</p><p>\"While many people can use cannabis without harm, there are some people who have adverse consequences from using it,\" she continued. \"If they're frequent users and they're experiencing some of these symptoms, they should consider the possibility that cannabis may be causing rather than helping them with those symptoms.\"</p><p>Emily Feinstein, executive vice president for the Center on Addiction, praised the study for shedding new light on the relative safety of marijuana use.</p><p>\"Misinformation and misunderstanding about marijuana is rampant,\" Feinstein said. \"Marijuana is addictive, and people who are dependent on the drug exhibit the same symptoms as those with other addictions, including cravings and withdrawal.\" She was not involved with the study.</p><p>\"When teens and young adults use marijuana, they are nearly twice as likely to become addicted as adults. In the debate about legalizing recreational marijuana, we can't lose sight of that,\" Feinstein continued. \"We need to take the public health risks associated with expanded use of the drug seriously.\"</p><p>The new study was published recently in the journal <i>Drug and Alcohol Dependence</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse has more about <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/marijuana-addictive\" target=\"_new\">marijuana and addiction</a>.</p>",

More than 202 million people are affected by PAD worldwide, and many of them smoke: More than one-third of PAD patients in the study were active smokers.</p> <p>\"Smoking is the single most important modifiable risk factor for peripheral artery disease. It is associated with faster progression of the disease, greater risk of complications such as limb amputations, heart attacks and death, and also poor response to treatment,\" said the study's lead author, Dr. Krishna Patel, a cardiology fellow at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute.</p> <p>\"Smoking cessation is the cornerstone for managing patients with PAD. It could halt the disease progression and improve and reverse some of these risks,\" she said.</p> <p>Researchers studied 1,275 patients at vascular specialty clinics in the United States, Australia and the Netherlands who were in advanced stages of PAD with blockages in limb arteries. The year-long study found that few doctors emphasized smoking cessation or gave patients adequate resources to help them quit, Patel said.</p> <p>\"Less than one in five smokers received a referral to a smoking cessation counseling program from their doctors, and only one in 10 received medicines or nicotine replacement therapy to help them quit,\" she said. \"Perhaps as a result, these patients either continue smoking or have a very high rate of relapse if they make an attempt to quit.\"</p> <p>Patel said one-third of smokers in the study who tried to quit relapsed within a year. \"Doctors taking care of these patients need to be aware of this and should treat smoking as any other chronic addiction problem and provide consistent, repeated and continuous smoking cessation support,\" she said.</p> <p>Dr. Aruna Pradhan, a cardiologist and epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, called the study \"a call to action to the vascular community.\"</p> <p>\"This is a unique, well-conducted study that provides a clear message to providers that we're not doing enough about this issue,\" said Pradhan, who was not involved in the research.</p> <p>Pradhan said there were several reasons why she and other cardiologists might not have done enough to help PAD patients quit smoking, including a lack of time and not being aware of how effective smoking cessation therapies can be.</p> <p>\"We're guilty of not going out of our comfort zone into areas like nutrition and smoking cessation and lifestyle behavioral modifications,\" she said. \"We're often so focused on pharmacotherapies for things we know we can treat &ndash; things like LDL cholesterol and blood pressure.\"</p> <p>She said she'd like to see studies on the best ways to get cardiologists to include smoking cessation in PAD treatment, especially because more and more health insurance plans now cover smoking cessation.</p> <p>Whatever the answer is, the study offers a clear message that cardiologists need to increase their time and effort in this area, Pradhan said.</p> <p>\"Smoking cessation is an intervention that can prevent progression of this disease. We really need to get on board,\" she said.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 3, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Decades-old allegations of sexual assault have consumed the nation for the past two weeks, as the Senate, the FBI and the public wrestle with what it all may mean for both the U.S. Supreme Court and American society at large in the age of &#35;MeToo.</p><p>The high-stakes debate is still unfolding. But now comes a new study that warns that sexual assault and harassment often take a significant long-term toll on a victim's mental and physical health, increasing the risk not only for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but also high blood pressure and sleep loss.</p><p>\"The long-term health effects related to sexual harassment and assault is not just about the impact that it has on a person's mental health,\" said study author Karestan Koenen. \"This study is evidence that this kind of trauma has a real and measurable physical impact, which needs to be considered.\"</p>  <p>Koenen is a professor of psychiatric epidemiology with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.</p><p>She and her colleagues reported their findings online Oct. 3 in <i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i>. The findings are also scheduled for presentation this week at a meeting of the North American Menopause Society, in San Diego.</p><p>For the study, researchers focused on just over 300 women between 40 and 60 years old, with an average age of 54. All were residents of Pittsburgh and were part of a broader study examining the link between menopausal hot flashes and atherosclerosis, commonly known as hardening of the arteries. Roughly three-quarters of the women were white.</p><p>All completed a full physical assessment, and a trauma interview and questionnaire.</p><p>Nearly one in five (19 percent) said they'd experienced verbal or physical sexual harassment in the workplace. Just over one in five (22 percent) said they'd been sexually assaulted. About 10 percent said they had been the victim of both.</p><p>Women who had been sexually harassed tended to be college-educated, though they were also more likely to struggle financially.</p><p>The study found that sexual harassment was linked to significantly higher blood pressure -- and a 20 percent increase in heart disease risk -- among those not already taking blood pressure drugs. Higher blood fat levels also were observed, as was poor sleep quality that equated to a doubling of insomnia risk.</p><p>Sexual assault victims saw their risk for major depression symptoms triple and their anxiety risk double. Their risk for poor sleep quality and insomnia doubled, the study authors reported.</p><p>The study only uncovered an association between sexual assault and subsequent health troubles, however, not a cause-and-effect connection.</p><p>Koenen said the findings indicate \"that sexual assault and harassment may need to be screened as significant health risk factors by primary care physicians, the way physicians often screen patients for depression or smoking.\"</p><p>That suggestion was seconded by Dean Kilpatrick, a distinguished university professor of clinical psychology at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston.</p><p>\"Not everyone will experience persistent and long-term effects following assault or harassment. Some people are helped by being surrounded by a lot of good social support,\" he said. </p><p>\"But many people are not,\" Kilpatrick added. \"In fact, many women don't talk about their experience with anybody, sometimes for decades, often for fear of not being believed or of being called either a 'nut' or a 'slut.' So they carry around a secret, which sort of eats away at them, and precludes them from getting the help they need. And these are very, very stressful experiences, both physically and psychologically. So the risk for long-term mental and physical health problems is very real and should not be trivialized.\"</p><p>Kilpatrick said that, without reaching out and getting needed help, victims often find that the notion that \"things get better with time\" is not borne out.</p><p>Why? \"There's some evidence that when you have these sorts of very extreme and scary experiences happen early in life that it can really dis-regulate the stress response system, meaning the normal impetus to 'fight, flight or freeze.' And we've known that about 60 percent of all sexual assaults and rapes or attempted rapes happen before the age of 18.\"</p><p>And, he added, \"that can lead to a build-up of years of chronic stress&hellip; And we're not built to stay under chronic stress for a long time. So in the end, it's that stress that may end up accounting for the higher blood pressure and other things this investigation found.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on sexual assault at the <a href=\"https://www.womenshealth.gov/relationships-and-safety/sexual-assault-and-rape/sexual-assault/\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a>.</p>",

He is associate director of the Center for Integrative Pain Neuroimaging at Harvard Medical School.</p> <p>The new research used an advanced imaging test called positron emission tomography (PET) and looked at 31 people with fibromyalgia and 27 healthy \"controls\" from Boston and Stockholm, Sweden.</p><p>Dr. Harry Gewanter, a master of the American College of Rheumatology, agreed the findings could bring comfort to patients.</p><p>\"There's a heck of a lot of stigma associated with chronic pain conditions like fibromyalgia. I think it's going to make a lot of people feel much better to know that there are physiologic changes you can find,\" Gewanter said.</p><p>Fibromyalgia causes pain throughout the body, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The condition also causes sleep problems, fatigue and difficulty with thinking and memory.</p> <p>The disorder affects about 4 million Americans, the CDC reports. The exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, though the researchers said it's likely a disease of the central nervous system. Medications and lifestyle modifications can help manage the condition.</p><p>All of the volunteers in the study underwent PET scans. Fibromyalgia patients in Boston were heavier than the healthy controls in Boston, and those in Stockholm with fibromyalgia.  The researchers said this was the only significantly different variable between the two groups.</p><p>When the researchers compared the scans of people with fibromyalgia to healthy controls, they saw more inflammation in the immune cells of the brain (glia) in people with fibromyalgia.</p><p>Loggia said the findings might lead to better ways to test fibromyalgia treatments, to see if they reduce inflammation.  It's also possible that this finding may eventually help researchers tease out the cause of the disorder.</p> <p>Gewanter said this study gives scientists a number of possible directions to go. One is to be able to follow a treatment to see how well it works. Another is possibly developing ways to intervene with new treatments.</p><p>Now, treatment focuses on medication and lifestyle changes. According to the CDC, people with fibromyalgia are encouraged to try to exercise 30 minutes daily most days of the week. And establishing regular sleep habits can help, as can reducing stress as much as possible, perhaps using yoga or meditation.</p><p>The study was published recently in the journal <i>Brain, Behavior, and Immunity</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about fibromyalgia from the <a href=\"https://www.rheumatology.org/I-Am-A/Patient-Caregiver/Diseases-Conditions/Fibromyalgia\" target=\"_new\">American College of Rheumatology</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 6, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Despite three decades of declines in secondhand smoke exposure, 58 million Americans -- children included -- are still breathing in tobacco fumes, federal health officials reported Thursday.</p><p>Nearly 40 percent of children aged 3 to 11 are exposed to secondhand smoke, as are nearly 50 percent of the poor and almost 40 percent of people living in apartments, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>\"The good news is that secondhand smoke is down since we started measuring it in the late 1980s,\" said Brian King, deputy director for research translation in the CDC's Office on Smoking and Health. </p><p>Nearly 90 percent of Americans were exposed to secondhand smoke in 1988, but that number dropped to 25 percent in 2014, he said. </p><p>\"The bad news is that we still have marked disparities across population groups, and we haven't seen any change since 2011,\" King added. </p><p>The dangers of secondhand smoke are well-known. Secondhand smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals, including some 70 that can cause cancer, the CDC team said in background notes. </p><p>Secondhand smoke can also cause sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, ear infections, asthma attacks in infants and children, as well as heart disease, stroke and lung cancer, the researchers pointed out.</p><p>Each year, exposure to secondhand smoke causes more than 41,000 deaths from lung cancer and heart disease among nonsmoking adults and 400 cases of SIDS, according to the 2014 U.S. Surgeon General's Report. </p><p>In the new study, the researchers used readings of cotinine levels, a marker of secondhand smoke found in the blood, from the 2011 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.</p><p>They found that the number of people exposed to secondhand smoke did not decline among most groups. That could be because many states have still not enacted laws that forbid smoking in workplaces, restaurants or bars at the state and local levels, the researchers said.</p><p>Only 27 states and the District of Columbia have such laws. Since 2014, however, some laws have been enacted in local areas that might eventually trigger more reductions in exposure to secondhand smoke.</p><p>From 2015 to 2017, nearly 200 communities adopted comprehensive smoke-free laws and another 21 have implemented these laws since July 2018, according to the report. </p><p>Children's exposure to secondhand smoke usually happens in homes when parents smoke. Exposure also occurs in apartment buildings and public housing where smokers live. Exposure should decline in public housing, however, as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development adopted a rule requiring public housing to be smoke-free after July 31, 2018.</p><p>Since laws banning smoking in public places have been enacted, \"private places like homes and vehicles are the last bastion of places where people can smoke cigarettes,\" King said. </p><p>According to the report: </p><ul><li>Among blacks who don't smoke, half are exposed to secondhand smoke, including 2 out of 3 children.</li><li>Among people who don't smoke and didn't graduate from high school, 3 of 10 are exposed to secondhand smoke.</li><li>Among people living in a home with a smoker, 7 of 10 are exposed to secondhand smoke.</li></ul><p>The report will be published Dec. 7 in the CDC's <i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</i>.</p><p>Although fewer adults are smoking cigarettes than ever before, too many Americans are still exposed to secondhand smoke, said Thomas Carr, director of national policy at the American Lung Association.</p><p>\"Exposure continues to be prevalent in certain populations, and we need more smoke-free laws,\" he said.</p><p>Proven ways to reduce exposure to secondhand smoke include laws that prohibit smoking in workplaces and public places, along with smoke-free home and car rules. Educational programs warning people about the risks of secondhand smoke are effective, the CDC researchers said. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/secondhand_smoke/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">secondhand smoke</a>.</p>",

That strain has been circulating and was pandemic in 2009 and in 1918. </p><p>In 1918, H1N1 flu killed 50 million people  around the world. But the current vaccine works exceedingly well against H1N1 -- it is up to  65 percent effective, which is highly effective for a flu vaccine, according to the CDC.</p><p>\"H1N1 is the most common [strain] in most of the country,\" Brammer said. \"But it's odd that in the Southeast, the H3N2 virus is more common.\"</p><p>The influenza A H3N2 strain is the one that made last year's flu season so severe. When that strain predominated, nearly 1 million Americans were hospitalized and 80,000 died.</p><p>According to the CDC, flu activity is high in Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Virginia.</p><p>It's too early to tell how severe this season will be or what the mix of viruses will be, Brammer said. Right now, the hospitalization rate is still relatively low compared with last year, and deaths are still below epidemic levels, she said.  </p><p>\"But as we see a jump in activity as we did this week, we would expect an increase in hospitalizations, and unfortunately, probably an increase in mortality,\" Brammer said.</p><p>The CDC doesn't track adult deaths from flu, but they do keep tabs on pediatric deaths. This week two more children have died from flu, bringing the total to 13.</p><p>\"There's still a lot more flu season to come,\" she said.  \"I expect activity to continue for several more weeks.\"</p><p>The best way to protect yourself and those around you is to get a flu shot, and there's still plenty of time to get vaccinated, Brammer said.</p><p>\"Anybody who hasn't been vaccinated should go and get vaccinated,\" she said. This year's vaccine is well matched to the circulating strains of flu and a lot of vaccine is available, Brammer added.</p> <p>The CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get vaccinated. Getting your kids their flu shot is the best way to protect them and prevent deaths from the complications of flu, she said.</p><p>Getting a flu shot should be at the top of the list for those at high risk for flu, including the elderly and people with heart disease or lung disease and pregnant women.</p><p>Getting vaccinated won't guarantee that you won't come down with flu, but if you do, your illness will be milder, health experts say.</p><p>If you get the flu, antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu and Relenza can make your illness less severe. But if you're sick, the CDC recommends that you stay home so you won't infect others.</p> <p>Brammer can't predict when the flu season will peak, but it most likely won't be until the end of February or March. So there's still a long way to go, she said. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on the flu, visit the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.htm/\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

The feel-good effects also appeared to linger into the following day.</p><p>\"This finding is consistent with multiple emerging lines of evidence demonstrating the ability of touch behaviors within close relationships to reduce perceptions of threat and increase feelings of security and well-being,\" said study author Michael Murphy. He's a postdoctoral research associate in psychology at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.</p><p>\"While this research is still in its preliminary stages, our study suggests that consensual hugs might be a simple yet effective way to provide support to both women and men enduring relationship conflict,\" Murphy added.</p><p>While most prior research has focused on the role of touch in romantic relationships, Murphy and his team concentrated on consensual -- not sexual -- hugging. More than 400 women and men were interviewed each night for 14 consecutive days about their conflicts, hugs received, and positive and negative feelings.</p><p>The researchers found no difference in the stress-reducing effects of hugs in women and men. Also, no difference was noted between those who were married or in a committed relationship and those who were not.</p> <p>But several important questions remain, Murphy said, including whether a hug's timing matters in relation to conflicts.</p> <p>\"Does who provides the hug matter? Does it matter if hugs are offered in direct response to conflict or independent of conflict?\" he asked, noting that he's undertaking new research to examine that.</p><p>A 2015 Carnegie Mellon study found that those who were hugged more had a lower risk of catching colds after being exposed to the virus, Murphy noted.</p><p>And other physically beneficial effects of hugs have been documented, said Harris Stratyner, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City.</p><p>Hugging can increase natural levels of oxytocin, a feel-good chemical that helps mothers and babies bond, said Stratyner, who wasn't involved with the study.</p><p>It's amazing to see what hugs can do, so I wasn't surprised by the study's findings in the least,\" said Stratyner. \"We have always known that hugs can soothe. A hug transcends anger and anguish and loss.</p><p>\"Hugs are transformational,\" he added, \"and like music, they're universal.\"</p><p>Murphy and Stratyner agreed that people can likely tell the difference between a heartfelt hug and a more perfunctory one.</p><p>\"They have to have the quality of genuineness,\" Stratyner noted. \"It can't be a hug that's a standoffish kind of thing.\"</p><p>The study was published Oct. 3 in the journal <i>PLOS ONE</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Oregon Health and Science University offers <a href=\"https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/faculty/mentoring/mentoring-best-practices/challenges/resolving-conflict.cfm\" target=\"_new\">tips on resolving conflict</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Oct. 2, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Americans' love affair with fast food continues, with 1 in every 3 adults chowing down on the fare on any given day.</p><p>That's the finding from a new report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When asked by researchers, 37 percent of adults said they'd eaten fast food at least once over the past 24 hours.</p><p>There was one surprise: Bucking the notion that poorer Americans favor fast food the most, the report found that intake actually rose with income.</p><p>For example, while about 32 percent of lower-income folks ate fast food daily, more than 36 percent of middle-income consumers had fast food on a given day, as did 42 percent of those with higher incomes, the report found.</p><p>Whatever your income bracket, fast food probably isn't doing your health any favors. That's because it \"has been associated with increased intake of calories, fat and sodium,\" the CDC team said.</p><p>All that adds up to widening waistlines and hardening arteries, one nutritionist warned.</p><p>\"Most fast food is not good for our bodies,\" said Liz Weinandy, a registered dietitian at Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center. </p><p>\"The more of it we eat, the more likely we are to be overweight or obese and have increased risk for several diseases like type 2 diabetes, heart disease and metabolic syndrome when talking to patients,\" she said.</p><p>Too often, though, Americans ignore the danger.</p><p>\"When we see news clips of a shark swimming near a beach, it scares us into not going near that beach,\" Weinandy said. But \"what we <i>should</i> be scared of is double cheeseburgers, french fries and large amounts of sugary beverages.\"</p><p>The new report was led by Cheryl Fryar of the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. Her team tracked data from in-person government surveys conducted with thousands of U.S. adults between 2013 and 2016. People were asked to recall what they'd eaten in the past 24 hours.</p><p>The report found that Americans tend to taper off fast foods as they age. While about 45 percent of people in their 20s and 30s said they'd eaten fast food over the prior day, that number dropped to just under 38 percent for people in their 40s and 50s, and about 24 percent for people aged 60 and older, the study found.</p><p>Blacks were more likely to have eaten fast food on a given day than whites (roughly 42 percent vs. 38 percent, respectively), while 35.5 percent of Hispanics and 31 percent of Asian-Americans did so. Men tended to eat more fast food than women, Fryar's group said.</p><p>Black men were the most avid consumers of fast food -- almost 42 percent had eaten the fare over the past day, the report found.</p><p>Melanie Boehmer is a registered dietitian at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. Reading over the report, she said, \"On any given day, over one-third of Americans consume fast food -- that's a lot of Big Macs and pizza.\" </p><p>\"These findings remind us that fast food companies have figured out a way to conveniently fit into our daily routine, despite their [products'] negative health implications,\" Boehmer said.</p><p>She believes that policymakers, doctors and health food advocates need to \"beat fast food companies at their own game\" in order to turn things around.</p><p>\"If we can offer healthier options that are just as convenient and just as affordable and just as delicious, then it's a win for everybody,\" Boehmer said.</p><p>Weinandy agreed that America has to wean itself off its fast food habit.</p><p>\"There is no reason to completely avoid fast food, but it shouldn't be consumed regularly,\" she said. \"You may want to ask yourself how often you're currently eating it and then cut that number in half if it's more than once a week.\"</p> <p>The new report was published Oct. 3 as an National Center for Health Statistics Data Brief.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>Find out more about healthy eating at the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating\" target=\"_new\">American Heart Association</a>.</p>",

But this study is the first to show that it can easily spread between the nose and the hands.</p><p>The health implications are nothing to sniff at, the research team said.</p><p>\"Pneumococcal infection is a major cause of death around the world, and it is estimated that it is responsible for 1.3 million deaths in children under 5 years [of age] annually,\" said lead researcher  Victoria Connor.  She's a clinical research fellow at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in England.</p><p> \"The elderly and people with other causes of impaired immunity, such as chronic illness, are also at an increased risk of pneumococcal infections,\" she added.</p><p>Connor called the current understanding of how pneumonia is transmitted \"poor, so we wanted to look at how it may be spread in the community.\"</p><p>In the study, the hands of the 40 healthy adults were contaminated with pneumococcus bacteria.  Participants were divided into four groups. The \"wet sniff\" group sniffed their hands, which had been contaminated with water laden with pneumococcus bacteria. The \"dry sniff\" group did the same, but this time the bacteria were applied dry, to the back of the hand. A third group, called \"wet poke,\" picked or poked their nose with a finger that had been contaminated with bacteria-laden water, while the \"dry poke\" group did the same, but with fingers tainted with air-dried bacteria samples.</p><p>The result: while pneumococcus was readily passed on in all of the test groups, hand-to-nose spread of the germ was highest among the \"wet sniff\" and \"wet poke\" groups, probably because bacteria die off more in dryer environments, the team said.</p><p>The findings were reported Oct. 10 in the <i>European Respiratory Journal</i>.</p><p>The study suggests that good hand hygiene, as well as keeping kids' toys clean, could help protect youngsters from catching and spreading the bacteria to other children. It could also cut down on spread to a child's elderly relatives, who may be more susceptible to infection, the researchers noted.</p><p>Of course, Connor acknowledged that \"it might not be realistic to get children to stop picking, poking and rubbing their noses.\"</p><p>There might even be one positive side to nose-picking. \"[The] presence of the bacteria can sometimes boost the immune system of children and can reduce their chances of carrying it again later in life,\" Connor noted in a journal news release.</p><p>But spreading these germs can cause real harm to others, she stressed.</p><p>So, restraining kids from picking their noses \"may be important when children are in contact with elderly relatives or relatives with reduced immune systems,\" Connor suggested.</p> <p>\"In these situations, ensuring good hand hygiene and cleaning of toys or surfaces would likely reduce transmission, and reduce the risk of developing pneumococcal infection such as pneumonia,\" she said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians has more on <a href=\"https://familydoctor.org/condition/pneumonia/?adfree=true\" target=\"_new\">pneumonia</a>.</p>",

The death rate associated with this cancer tends to be high because it is routinely diagnosed at a late stage. </p><p>\"This important work could explain why there is an increase in the oral cancers among World Trade Center-exposed workers, who had a massive exposure to fine particulate matter,\" said Moline, who was not involved with the new study. </p><p>\"Further research like this is critical to understanding the implications of air pollution, whether from industrial facilities, or the aftermath of a disaster such as the World Trade Center attacks,\" she added.</p><p>Fine-particle pollution -- the main cause of haze -- stems from chemicals emitted by power plants, industries and automobiles, as well as smoke from fires, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p>For this study, researchers compared the health records of more than 482,000 men 40 and older with pollution data gathered from 66 air quality monitoring stations across Taiwan. </p><p>Smoking and frequent betel quid chewing were associated with increased risk, but so too were heavy levels of particulate pollution.</p><p>Because the particles in pollution are so tiny, the heavy metals contained within them might be easily absorbed by the tissues of the mouth, researchers said. Their size might also allow them to wreak greater havoc on the body.</p><p>Liaw said people concerned about mouth cancer should pay attention to air quality reports and avoid prolonged outdoor activities when particulate pollution levels are too high. They also might consider wearing a face mask when outdoors to reduce the amount of air pollutants they inhale.</p><p>\"Because it is hard to completely avoid exposure to air pollution, modification of lifestyles associated with oral cancer is encouraged,\" Liaw said. For instance, not smoking, not chewing betel quid and avoiding exposure to air pollutants may help prevent the malignancy, he said.</p><p>Liaw also recommended mouth-cancer screening for people living in smoggy areas, \"to avoid late diagnosis and subsequent mortality.\"</p><p>The findings were published Oct. 9 in the <i>BMJ</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Oral Cancer Foundation has more about <a href=\"https://oralcancerfoundation.org/facts/\" target=\"_new\">mouth cancer</a>.</p>",

As a result, many modern Europeans and Asians have about 2 percent of Neanderthal DNA in their genomes, the researchers explained.</p><p>Some bits of Neanderthal DNA are more common in modern humans than others, and scientists wondered if this was because those genes provided specific evolutionary advantages.</p><p>The new Stanford University study suggests that may be the case.</p><p>\"Our research shows that a substantial number of frequently occurring Neanderthal DNA snippets were adaptive for a very cool reason,\" said researcher Dmitri Petrov, an evolutionary biologist at Stanford.</p><p>\"Neanderthal genes likely gave us some protection against viruses that our ancestors encountered when they left Africa,\" Petrov said in a university news release.</p><p>When modern humans migrated out of Africa to Europe and Asia, they were exposed to new viruses. But Neanderthals had been living outside of Africa for hundreds of thousands of years, and their immune systems had evolved defenses against those viruses, the study authors explained.</p><p>According to David Enard, a former postdoctoral fellow in Petrov's lab,  \"It made much more sense for modern humans to just borrow the already adapted genetic defenses from Neanderthals rather than waiting for their own adaptive mutations to develop, which would have taken much more time.\"</p><p>The researchers found that the genetic defenses that modern humans received from Neanderthals were against RNA viruses, which encode their genes with RNA, a molecule that's chemically similar to DNA.</p><p>The study was published online Oct. 4 in the journal <i>Cell</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Smithsonian Institution has more on <a href=\"http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/genetics/ancient-dna-and-neanderthals/dna-genotypes-and-phenotypes\" target=\"_new\">Neanderthal genes</a>.</p>",

Now use these tips to make the most of these workouts.</p><p>If you're using a machine, like a treadmill or stationary bike, check that you're maintaining proper form. Just as coasting when riding a bike outdoors doesn't provide a workout, resting your upper body on the handles of a machine or slumping on its console means you aren't working as well as you could be. If you're having a hard time staying upright, you may have set the machine at too fast or challenging a setting.</p><p>Speaking of machines, resist making one machine in particular your only type of cardio workout. You'll expand your horizons and get some fresh air by running or walking outdoors or taking a swim when weather permits. You might find that being outside makes the workout more interesting and invigorating.</p><p>When working out at a gym, add a fun element by creating a cardio fitness circuit, especially if you find yourself getting bored after the first 10 minutes on a machine. Break up your workout into a mini triathlon: 10 minutes on the treadmill, 10 on the bike and 10 in the pool doing laps or water exercises.</p><p>Remember that cardio doesn't always have to feel like hard work. Spend a fun evening going dancing with friends or your significant other. It may not seem like it, but if you break into a sweat, you're getting your heart rate up.</p><p>Finally, make a plan to regularly try a new form of cardio, not just to stave off boredom, but also to challenge different muscles and add to your overall fitness level.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Council on Exercise has tips to help you make the most of <a href=\"https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/lifestyle/blog/3701/4-cardio-training-mistakes-to-avoid\" target=\"_new\">cardio workouts</a>.</p>",

If you plan to do a race, go for a run or run/walk ahead of time to assess your fitness level.</li><li>Slowly ease into new activities. Cross-train to vary the stresses on your joints. Stretch after an activity and do recovery workouts to reduce soreness. Dress appropriately for the weather. If you've previously had an injury, do preventive exercises before an activity.</li><li>Instead of touch football or a holiday 5K over the holidays, consider low-impact strength-training activities such as a walk or bike ride, yoga and Pilates.</li></ul><p>Another option is to look for a holiday deal at a local gym, rather than waiting after New Year's Day to begin a fitness program, Shybut suggested.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/features/healthytips/index.html\" target=\"_new\">holiday health tips</a>.</p>",

It can happen when it's cold inside or outside and the body is unable to produce enough heat. </p><p>Even short exposure to cold can result in hypothermia. Older folks are especially vulnerable because their response to cold can be diminished by chronic medical conditions and some medicines, including over-the-counter cold remedies, the officials noted.</p><p>Warning signs of hypothermia include: slowed or slurred speech; sleepiness or confusion; shivering or stiffness in the arms and legs; poor control over body movement; slow reactions; weak pulse; or a core body temperature of 95 degrees Fahrenheit or lower.</p><p>A body temperature that low can cause health problems, such as heart rhythm disturbances, and kidney and liver damage, according to information in an NIH news release.</p><p>If you think someone has the signs of hypothermia, call 911 and try to move them to a warmer place.</p><p>Tips to avoid hypothermia include: </p><ul><li>When outside in the cold, wear a hat, scarf and gloves. Wear several layers of clothing to trap warm air between the layers.</li><li>Let others know when you're planning to spend time outside and have a fully charged cellphone with you.</li><li>Keep your home warm. Set the thermostat to at least 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Even homes at 60 to 65 degrees can trigger hypothermia in older adults.</li><li>At home, wear long underwear under clothes as well as socks and slippers.

Between 2012 and 2017, the patients had visited one of 57 federally qualified health centers that provide health care to underserved communities in 19 states.</p><p>Of the 875 people with diagnosed opioid addiction, only 36 percent were tested for hepatitis C. Of those, 11 percent had been exposed to hepatitis C and almost 7 percent had evidence of chronic hepatitis C infection, the researchers found.</p><p>Overall, 2.5 percent, or more than 6,800 teens and young adults who visited the health centers, were tested for hepatitis C. Of those, 122 tested positive for it. Those most likely to be tested were black, had any substance use disorder, and were ages 19 to 21.</p><p>The study was presented Thursday at IDWeek, a meeting of infectious disease specialists, in San Francisco.</p><p>Injection drug users who share needles often spread hepatitis C. It's possible that doctors don't test suspected opioid abusers because the drugs are available in pill form, which doesn't increase the risk of hepatitis C. However, studies show many youths who misuse prescription opioid pills eventually begin injecting drugs, the researchers noted.</p><p>Current guidelines only recommend hepatitis C testing for known injection drug users.</p><p>\"The issue is complicated by the fact that not enough at-risk youth are screened for opioid or other drug use for a variety of reasons, including lack of time, comfort level between clinician and patient, and privacy and stigma concerns,\" Epstein said in a meeting news release.</p><p>\"And even when drug use is identified, there's a belief that youth are less likely to test positive for hepatitis C, which isn't necessarily the case as we show in our study. Clearly, this is an overlooked group that is at high risk,\" she concluded.</p><p>Research presented at meetings is usually considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians has more on <a href=\"https://familydoctor.org/condition/hepatitis-c/?adfree=true\" target=\"_new\">hepatitis C</a>.</p>",

But if you have a cold that could last a full week, you probably won't want to find yourself facing a fitness setback once you've recovered.</p><p>Here's how to stay in the game.</p><p>The general guideline is that you should be able to work out if your symptoms are from the neck up, like a stuffy nose from a cold, but not when you have the whole-body achiness of the flu. Easy or moderate exercise, such as walking rather than running, should be fine. Some experts say it could even be beneficial.</p><p>But you don't want to spread germs at the gym, so work out at home to avoid infecting others. And remember to cut back on the intensity and length of your usual workout as needed to avoid further taxing your body and risking injury.</p><p>If you're sick enough that you need to significantly scale back your usual workout, a call to your doctor's office is warranted -- beyond whether it's safe to exercise with your particular illness, ask whether you need an office visit. Even if you get the go-ahead to exercise, tread lightly so you can see how your body responds. Stop if necessary -- pay attention to any clues that you just can't handle the physical exertion you're attempting.</p><p>If you have the full gamut of flu symptoms, like fever, fatigue and body aches, even moderate exercise is out. You might need to wait 2 to 4 weeks after recovery before you get back to high-level workouts. Return at a slow pace and gradually build up to avoid stressing your system.</p><p>What about exercise when you have a chronic condition?</p><p>Health experts say exercise may help you better manage it, especially if the illness is characterized by inflammation, such as an inflammatory bowel or rheumatic disease, because exercise engenders an <i>anti-</i>inflammatory response in the body. But you may need to sit out a severe flare, such as a rheumatoid arthritis attack.</p><p>And always follow your doctor's advice if you need to take any medications that make it unsafe to exercise.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Mayo Clinic has more on how to tell if you're <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/exercise/faq-20058494\" target=\"_new\">too sick to exercise</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Oct. 11, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The hormone prolactin -- most commonly associated with breastfeeding -- may play a role in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes, a new study suggests. </p><p>Researchers found that women with the highest levels of the hormone, though still in the normal range, had a 27 percent reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those with the lowest levels in the normal range. </p><p>\"Prolactin is a multi-function hormone -- it is not only related to pregnancy and breastfeeding, it also plays an important role in many other biological functions, like metabolism, immune regulation and water balance,\" said study lead author Jun Li. She is a post-doctoral research fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. </p><p>Li said previous studies have shown that prolactin may affect insulin secretion and sensitivity. Insulin carries sugar from the bloodstream into the body's cells to be used as fuel. People with type 2 diabetes don't use insulin efficiently, and as a result, their blood sugar levels rise too high. </p><p>Although the study linked higher (but still normal) levels of prolactin to a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes, Li said it's not yet clear if there are any practical implications from these findings. </p><p>\"It's too early to tell if altering prolactin concentrations is a suitable way for diabetes prevention,\" she said, adding that normally high prolactin levels are associated with a higher breast cancer risk. Plus, higher-than-normal levels can promote weight gain and increase insulin resistance, along with other adverse effects. </p><p>\"Future studies are needed to find out the mechanism and come up with practical strategies,\" Li said. </p><p>Diabetes expert Dr. Joel Zonszein said much about prolactin is unknown. \"It's a hormone made by the pituitary gland, and in women it goes up during lactation. But, we don't really know what it does in men.\" </p><p>What doctors do know is that prolactin levels normally vary a lot, he said. Zonszein is director of the clinical diabetes center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City.</p><p>Zonszein also noted that a diabetes medication called Cycloset (bromocriptine mesylate) lowers prolactin levels at the same time it lowers blood sugar levels -- an effect that would seem to contradict the new findings. </p><p>The study included more than 8,600 healthy American women whose health was tracked over time as part of a national study. Most were white and in their late 40s or 50s when the study began.</p><p>From that group, 699 women developed type 2 diabetes during an average follow-up period of 22 years.</p><p>The researchers adjusted the data to account for women's menopausal status and other diabetes risk factors.</p><p> The findings showed that the higher the women's prolactin levels (while still in the normal range), the less likely they were to develop type 2 diabetes.</p><p>But the study does not prove cause and effect.</p><p>The report was published Oct. 11 in the journal <i>Diabetologia</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/preventing-type-2-diabetes\" target=\"_new\"> preventing type 2 diabetes</a> from the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Oct. 15, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- A huge bowl of greens can be filling and chock full of vitamins, minerals and fiber. But what you top it with can turn it from diet delight to diet disaster.</p><p>Whether you're at home or facing a tempting all-you-can-eat salad bar at a restaurant, these tips will keep fat and calories in check.</p><p>Creamy dressings can have more than 130 calories per serving, nearly all of them fat -- and not the healthiest type of fat, either. Ranch, cheese and mayo-based dressings are all culprits. Instead, a drizzle of vinegar and a spray of olive oil will dress your lettuce with few calories.</p><p>Protein can turn salad into a meal, but stay away from fatty meats, bacon and fried chicken or shrimp. Try grilled salmon or chicken instead.</p><p>Cheese may be the worst of the salad bar mistakes -- mounds of shredded cheese add hundreds of calories. If you want some cheesy taste, sprinkle on a tablespoon of grated Parmesan. Even better, add a few chunks of fresh avocado for its healthy fats and creamy feel.</p><p>Croutons and crispy noodles add crunch, but little nutrition and lots of calories. A few nuts and seeds can provide the same type of crunch plus great nutrients. But use a spoon, not a ladle, to add them judiciously because they're relatively high in calories (due to healthful fats). Just make sure they're not sugar-glazed or overly salty.</p><p>Finally, if you're ordering a salad from a menu, watch out for the vessel it's served in. A bread or taco bowl, for instance, is just like eating extra servings of carbs and fat. Enjoy the contents, but not the shell.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Consumer Reports has a great guide for new ways to eat <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/fruits-vegetables/leafy-greens-new-ways-to-eat/\" target=\"_new\">leafy greens</a>.</p>",

She's a research scientist at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice in Hanover, N.H.</p><p>\"These depictions may affect fans' attitudes toward smoking and increase the likelihood of smoking -- particularly among young people,\" Knutzen said in an institute news release.</p><p>In 2017, hip-hop surpassed rock as the largest music genre in the United States.</p><p>For this study, researchers analyzed leading hip-hop music videos from 2013 to 2017. They found that the proportion that portrayed use of marijuana or tobacco/e-cigarettes ranged from 40 to 50 percent in those years, for a total of 39.5 billion views.</p><p>The more popular the song, the more likely the video featured use of these products, the researchers said. Also, smoking was most often associated with main artists. </p><p>\"When young people, especially adolescents, see their favorite artists using tobacco products in music videos, they can begin to view them as normal in hip-hop culture, and they can begin to see themselves using them,\" said study co-author Samir Soneji, an associate professor at the Dartmouth Institute.</p><p>\"They also could view them as less harmful then they are. That's a very real public health threat,\" Soneji said.</p><p>The researchers also found that brand placement became more common in online hip-hop music content over the five years studied.</p><p>In videos that showed people smoking pot or tobacco, brand placement rose from 0 percent in 2013 to 10 percent in 2017. In videos showing e-cigarettes, brand placement rose from 25 percent in 2013 to 88 percent in 2017.</p><p>These music videos provide \"largely unregulated opportunities\" for advertising of tobacco and marijuana products, the researchers said.

He is associate director of the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.</p><p>\"We now live in a fast-paced, 'always-on' era that causes increased psycho-social stress and, possibly, an increase in the likelihood of sudden cardiac arrest,\" Chugh said in a Cedars-Sinai news release.</p><p>For the study, Chugh's team analyzed data on cardiac arrests in Oregon between 2004 and 2014. Of the 1,535 people who died from sudden cardiac arrest, only 14 percent died between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 a.m., and there was no evidence that more cardiac arrests occurred on Mondays.</p><p>Along with stress, other factors that may explain the findings include changes in how high-risk patients are being treated, and problems with how past studies have measured time of death caused by cardiac arrest, such as using time of death on a death certificate rather than the actual time of death due to cardiac arrest, the researchers added.</p><p>Cardiac arrest is different than a heart attack, which is typically caused by reduced blood flow to the heart due to clogged arteries. Cardiac arrest is caused by defective electrical activity of the heart. Patients may have little or no warning, and usually experience sudden death. Each year in the United States, there are about 300,000 deaths from sudden cardiac arrest.</p><p>\"Because sudden cardiac arrest is usually fatal, we have to prevent it before it strikes,\" Chugh said. \"This is just another piece to the puzzle.

Your day might start with a relaxing yoga class, then progress to a massage or body wrap and finish with a mani-pedi. If you're unclear about any offerings, be sure to call for further descriptions or simply to ask questions.</p><p>Before booking, mention any health considerations you have, such as allergies or skin conditions. Typically a spa will also want to know if you're pregnant. If you're having a massage, state whether you prefer a man or woman practitioner, and be sure to specify the type of massage you want since techniques can vary from extremely gentle to very deep.</p><p>Often, a spa will recommend that you eat only a light meal before your visit so that your digestive system isn't working overtime while you're trying to relax. You might want to skip or at least limit the amount of caffeine you drink in the hours before you go.</p><p>To make the day effortless and prolong the spa feeling, arrange to be dropped off and picked up if possible so that maneuvering through rush-hour traffic won't erase your newfound feeling of tranquility.</p><p>Arrive about a half-hour before your first service to check in, put on a robe, and maybe even sip an herbal tea. And later, feel free to linger after your treatments. Some spas offer meals or snacks at a juice bar. Or maybe just enjoy leafing through a magazine in the reading room, soaking in the peace and quiet before returning to the real world.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Need help with your search for a great day spa?

But there are some signs that suggest your young person needs more serious help than a care package from home.</p><p>Some problems are temporary, like anxiety and stress, which affect huge numbers of college students. Some lifelong conditions, like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, may first appear now.</p><p>It may be hard for parents to tell if their college student needs better coping skills, a stronger support network or treatment for a serious mental health issue. But reaching out at the first signs of trouble can enable your child to get help before he or she reaches a crisis point.</p><p>Untreated mental health issues can lead to substance abuse, other dangerous behaviors and even suicide -- the second leading cause of death among college students after accidents.</p><p>Being unable to study, attend class or sleep and eat well are red flags for many problems, including anxiety disorders, depression and substance abuse.</p><p>Some Signs of Drug and Alcohol Abuse:</p><ul><li>Not remembering actions and events.</li> <li>Relationship problems.</li> <li>Risky behaviors like driving drunk.</li> <li>Falling and other injuries.</li></ul><p>Some Signs of Anxiety Disorders:</p><ul><li>Frequent feelings of fear or panic.</li> <li>Recurring nightmares and other sleep problems.</li> <li>Difficulty concentrating.</li> <li>Obsessive thoughts.</li></ul><p>Some Signs of Depression:</p><ul><li>Deep sadness, anxiety and irritability.</li><li>Loss of interest in social activities and favorite pastimes.</li><li>Sleeping difficulties.</li><li>Loss of or increase in appetite.</li></ul> <p>If you notice troubling signs, talk to your child about accessing on-campus resources like a student counseling center or health service. If your child is reluctant to get college counseling but willing to seek help off-campus, you might start the search for a community mental health center, hospital outpatient clinic or private therapist experienced with the situation your child is facing.</p><p>Once your child agrees to talk to a counselor or doctor, the next step is for him or her to make the appointment and take an active role in treatment.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Jed Foundation has detailed information to help parents spot <a href=\"https://www.jedfoundation.org/depresion-and-anxiety-among-college-students/\" target=\"_new\">transition year difficulties</a> early on.</p>",

For them, even a minuscule amount of gluten -- a protein in wheat and other grains -- can damage the intestinal lining.</p><p>\"As awareness of celiac disease and the gluten-free diet have increased in recent years, restaurants have sought to offer selections that are compatible with these restrictions,\" said study author Dr. Benjamin Lebwohl. \"But some establishments do a better job than others at preventing cross-contamination.\"</p><p>And some gluten-free foods were riskier than others. For example, more than half of all purportedly gluten-free pastas and pizzas had gluten, according to the study.</p><p>Why?</p><p>\"The fact that gluten was so often found in pizza suggests that sharing an oven with gluten-containing pizza is a prime setting for cross-contamination,\" explained Lebwohl, of Columbia University's Celiac Disease Center. \"Gluten-free pasta can be contaminated if prepared in a pot of water that was used to prepare gluten-containing pasta.\"</p><p>Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates packaged foods with gluten-free labeling, there's no federal oversight of gluten-free claims in restaurants, said Lebwohl. </p><p>For the study, more than 800 investigators set out to assess the true gluten content of dishes listed as gluten-free on menus. Armed with portable gluten sensors, they tested for gluten levels that met or exceeded 20 parts per million, the standard cutoff for any gluten-free claim.</p><p>Based on more than 5,600 gluten tests over 18 months, the investigators determined that 27 percent of gluten-free breakfast meals actually contained gluten. At dinner time, this figure hit 34 percent. The rise could reflect a steady increase in gluten contamination risk as the day unfolds, the researchers said.</p><p>The concerns extend beyond the celiac community alone.</p><p>\"There are also people who don't have celiac disease but have symptoms triggered by gluten,\" Lebwohl said. People with this problem -- non-celiac gluten sensitivity -- rely on gluten-free labeling and safe food preparation practices for prevention of uncomfortable symptoms, he noted. These can include constipation, bloating and nausea.</p><p>\"These results underscore the need for education in food preparation at restaurants, and the need for diners to inquire about these precautions,\" Lebwohl said.</p><p>Dietitian Lona Sandon agreed. Gluten contamination in restaurants has long \"been a concern for those with celiac disease,\" said Sandon, an associate professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. She was not involved with the study.</p><p>\"Restaurant kitchens are just not built to assure the prevention of gluten contamination,\" Sandon said. A chef may easily set a gluten-free bun down on a cutting board that just had a wheat bun on it while trying to get food out quickly to the customer. Then again, staff may just not know what has gluten in it and what doesn't, she added.</p><p>In the absence of federal enforcement at the restaurant level, it's up to the person handling the gluten-free product to keep it from becoming contaminated, Sandon said.</p><p>The study is scheduled for presentation Monday at a meeting of the American College of Gastroenterology, in Philadelphia. Research presented at meetings is usually considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on gluten-free foods and celiac disease at <a href=\"https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2016/05/going-gluten-free/\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Oct. 29, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Many injured workers turn to opioid painkillers for relief, and nearly 30 percent may still be taking them three months after their injury -- increasing the odds of addiction, a new study suggests.</p><p>\"The increased likelihood of persistent opioid use among strain and sprain injuries is potentially concerning, particularly given the limited evidence to support opioid therapy for these injuries,\" said study lead author Nathan O'Hara. He's a research associate at the University of Maryland School of Medicine's  department of orthopedics, in Baltimore.</p><p>Common injuries for which people claiming workers' compensation received opioids include crushes, strains and sprains, permanent disability and chronic joint pain, the researchers reported.</p><p>Because many workers use opioids for work-related injuries, and given the danger of addiction, O'Hara believes it's a big and possibly growing problem. Common opioids include OxyContin and Vicodin.</p><p>\"Since persistent opioid use does not correlate well with injury severity, consideration should be given to not initiating opioid use for non-severe injuries,\" he said.</p><p>The main concern shared by doctors is the use of opioids for non-acute pain, said senior researcher Dr. Gerard Slobogean, an assistant professor of orthopedics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. \"Physical therapy, other complementary and alternative therapies, as well as non-opioid medical therapies, should be considered for many injured workers,\" he said.</p><p>For the study, the researchers collected data on nearly 9,600 injured workers who filed workers' compensation claims in Maryland from 2008 to 2016. All patients were initially treated with opioids.</p><p>Other factors linked to persistent opioid use included being older and having a yearly income of more than $60,000, the researchers found.</p><p>Lindsey Vuolo is associate director for health law and policy at the Center on Addiction. \"The high rate of persistent opioid use among injured workers in this study is concerning because such use may signify misuse, a risk factor for opioid use disorder,\" she said. </p><p>The progression from misuse to use of illicit opioids, such as heroin and fentanyl, is a hallmark of America's opioid crisis, said Vuolo, who was not part of the study. In 2016, more than 11.5 million Americans reported misuse of prescription opioids, with more than 14,000 people dying from overdoses involving prescription opioids, the researchers noted.</p><p>What's more, opioids are often ineffective for long-term pain management, Vuolo said. Safer treatment options, such as non-opioid painkillers and physical therapy, should be tried first to manage chronic pain, she said. </p><p>Dr. Jianguo Cheng, director of the multidisciplinary pain medicine fellowship program at the Cleveland Clinic and president of the American Academy of Pain Medicine, agreed.</p><p>Doctors need to get out of the habit of prescribing opioids as the first option to treat pain, said Cheng, who was not involved with the study. </p><p>\"Minimize exposure and use in terms of dose and frequency,\" he recommended. \"However, for certain patients who have failed other treatments, opioids are still an option and can be effective. So patients should not be denied this treatment option.\"</p><p>The report was published online Oct. 26 in the journal <i>JAMA Network Open</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse</a> for more on opioids.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<!--Spanish ID: 739157 --><p>TUESDAY, Oct. 30, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Deciding to have weight-loss surgery is tough enough, but then you have to choose between several procedures -- each with different risks and potential weight loss.</p><p> So how do you decide which one is best for you?</p><p>New research that compares three types of weight-loss surgery in more than 46,000 patients may help. The three types of surgery included gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy and adjustable gastric banding (also known as lap band). </p><p>The study found that gastric bypass surgery boasted the greatest weight loss -- both short- and long-term. But that procedure also had the highest rates of complications in the month following surgery.</p><p>\"There are trade-offs. Bypass is more effective for weight loss, but has a greater risk of short-term complications. People need to consider, 'What do I value most?' Is safety your biggest concern?  Or, is it the magnitude of the weight loss?\" said study lead author Dr. David Arterburn. He's a senior researcher at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle.</p><p>Arterburn added that it's important to consider other weight-loss treatments, such as medication. </p><p>Nearly 25,000 people in the study had Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. This procedure involves making the stomach smaller and bypassing part of the small intestine, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). After this surgery, people get fuller on much less food, and the body doesn't absorb as many calories. </p><p>Almost 19,000 people in the study had sleeve gastrectomy, which involves taking out a portion of your stomach so that you get fuller faster.</p><p>Finally, more than 2,500 people had adjustable lap-band surgery. A surgeon places an inflatable band around the top of your stomach, leaving only a small pouch that can be filled with food. The rest of your stomach is filled with a balloon containing saline solution that is attached to the band, according to NIDDK. Arterburn said this procedure has fallen out of favor in recent years. </p><p>The study found that gastric bypass appeared to be most effective for weight loss:</p><ul><li>Gastric bypass surgery resulted in an average 31 percent loss of total body weight in the first year and 25 percent of total body weight after five years.</li><li>Sleeve gastrectomy led to a 25 percent loss in total body weight in the first year and 19 percent loss of total body weight after five years.</li><li>Adjustable gastric banding led to a 14 percent total weight loss after a year and 12 percent at five years.</li></ul><p>For the average person in this study, there was a 19-pound weight loss difference between the bypass and sleeve procedures after five years. The average person in this study weighed 277 pounds before surgery, the researchers said.</p><p>But the 30-day rate of serious complications for gastric bypass was nearly double the risk of the sleeve procedure. The rate of complications in the 30-day period after surgery was 5 percent for gastric bypass, 2.6 percent for sleeve gastrectomy and 2.9 percent for adjustable gastric banding. </p><p>The complications measured in the study included death, reoperation/repair procedures, clots, or failure to be discharged from the hospital within 30 days.</p><p>Gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy are similar in terms of cost, according to Arterburn. Each procedure averages between $20,000 and $30,000, he estimated. Adjustable gastric banding is less expensive and may average around $15,000, he noted. Insurance coverage for these procedures varies quite a bit, and not all will cover weight-loss surgery. </p><p>Dr. Mitchell Roslin, director of the bariatric surgery program at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y., said that people shouldn't only focus on the total weight loss when trying to select a procedure. </p><p>\"There is no perfect way. The more we change the body, the higher the weight loss, but complications may be higher. There's no one-size-fits-all weight-loss surgery,\" said Roslin, who wasn't involved with the study. </p><p>\"The decision really requires detailed conversation and education. You need to understand your own individual medical issues and objectives,\" he said. </p><p>Arterburn added that people should look for a surgeon that has experience in multiple weight-loss procedures. </p><p>\"Not every surgeon is equally comfortable with all of the procedures. Have a conversation with a surgeon who does all of the surgeries so the conversation is about what's right for you,\" he said. </p><p>The findings were published Oct. 29 in the <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases has more about <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/bariatric-surgery\" target=\"_new\"> weight-loss surgery</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Oct. 22, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- For some college students in the United States, the 2016 presidential election triggered significant distress symptoms, a new survey suggests.</p><p>Nearly 800 students were surveyed at one university. One-quarter suffered distress levels similar to what's seen among witnesses to a mass shooting, researchers said.</p><p>Such stress can interfere with daily tasks, including academic work. It can also be predictive of symptoms seen in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the researchers said in background notes.</p><p>However, the findings don't mean the election caused PTSD in those students, said Melissa Hagan, the lead researcher on the study.</p><p>The election and its outcome do not constitute a \"trauma\" as defined by the American Psychiatric Association, explained Hagan, an assistant professor of psychiatry at San Francisco State University.</p><p>By that definition, a trauma refers to an immediate threat to a person's physical safety or life.</p><p>\"These students were not assessed for PTSD, and therefore cannot be diagnosed as having PTSD or not,\" Hagan said.</p><p>But the findings do add to evidence that the political climate since the 2016 election has been a source of stress for many Americans.</p><p>The American Psychological Association (APA) conducts an annual \"Stress in America\" survey. Last year, it found that nearly two-thirds of Americans were stressed over the future of the nation -- making it the most commonly reported source of stress (just beating out perennial issues such as money and work.)</p><p>Lynn Bufka is a psychologist and associate executive director of practice research and policy at the APA.</p><p>While the new study asked different questions, the findings are \"certainly consistent\" with the APA survey, said Bufka.</p><p>She said the post-election political climate may have been enough to create an unusual amount of stress for some people.</p><p>Bufka noted that the survey was done about two to three months after the 2016 election.</p><p>\"At that point, people may have come to terms with the election results,\" Bufka said.</p><p>But, she added, many people may have been increasingly stressed by news reports, social media posts and face-to-face interactions with people who did not necessarily share their political views.</p><p>\"The general tenor of conversations shifted after the election. And that can be stressful in itself,\" Bufka said.</p><p>Hagan agreed that the aftermath of the election may partly explain students' distress levels.</p><p>The findings come from a survey of 769 students at Arizona State University.</p><p>They all completed a standard questionnaire on stress responses to \"significant life events.\" It asked them, for example, whether thoughts of the election cropped up in their daily lives, when they didn't actually want to think about it; or whether they actively avoided reminders of the election.</p><p>Not surprisingly, perhaps, students who identified as Democrats or Independents had higher distress scores than Republicans. Racial minorities, women, lower-income people and non-Christians scored higher, too.</p><p>The findings were reported Oct. 22 in the <i>Journal of American College Health</i>.</p><p>Since the survey was done at one university, Hagan said, the results would not be representative of all young Americans. </p><p>But she said that, to her, the message is straightforward: If the election stressed you out, \"you're not alone.\"</p><b>Unplugging may help</b><p>For people who are distressed by today's political climate, Hagan said it might help to take more breaks from political news, including social media -- unless that's how you get your social support.</p><p>Bufka agreed that media breaks can offer some needed perspective, especially for people who think they need to stay on top of all the news.</p><p>She also suggested volunteering, either with a political campaign or any cause you care about. \"That helps you feel that you're having an impact, even when things feel like they're out of your control,\" she said.</p><p>And, Bufka said, never underestimate the importance of adequate sleep, exercise and a healthy diet -- especially when you're stressed.</p><p>Those tips do not just apply to unhappy Democrats -- or any one group, Bufka said. In the APA survey, stress over the nation's future cut across party lines.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For advice on dealing with stress related to political change, visit the <a href=\" https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/stress-political-change.aspx\" target=\"_new\">American Psychological Association</a>.</p>",

Each child's weight was checked at their preschool immunization visits, between ages 4 and 6 years.</p><p>Rates of overweight/obesity were 43 percent among children who were larger than average at birth and whose mothers developed diabetes during pregnancy (a condition known as gestational diabetes). That's compared to just to 21 percent for kids who were average size at birth and whose mothers did not have gestational diabetes.</p><p>That means that the first group of children were about 2.8 times more likely to be overweight or obese than the second groups of kids, according to the study published Nov. 13 in the journal <i>Diabetologia</i>.</p><p>Rates of overweight/obesity were also higher among children who were born large and whose mothers had \"regular\" diabetes before their pregnancy (36 percent), the findings showed. Even with no maternal history of diabetes, however, 35 percent of children who were born large were still overweight or obese by the time they had their preschool vaccinations.</p><p>In fact, being a relatively large size at birth was calculated to contribute 39 percent to the risk of obesity in a child -- much higher than having a mother with gestational diabetes alone (16 percent) or pre-existing diabetes alone (15 percent), Kaul's group said.</p><p>Dr. Mitchell Kramer heads the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwell Health's Huntington Hospital in Huntington, N.Y.  Looking over the new findings, he agreed that a baby's weight at birth is \"a potentially modifiable factor.\"  </p><p> Kramer said certain things --  the mom-to-be's weight, control of her blood sugar during pregnancy, and the weight she gains during the pregnancy -- may all come into play in reducing risks for her children.</p><p>\"Also of note is that breastfeeding in the first five months of life was associated with a 25 percent lower likelihood of childhood overweight/obesity rates,\" compared with formula feeding, Kramer said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians has more on <a href=\"https://familydoctor.org/childhood-overweight-and-obesity/?adfree=true\" target=\"_new\">childhood overweight and obesity</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 21, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- No  respectable Thanksgiving plate is without some form of cranberry, but the  fruit's popularity seems to plummet the other 364 days of the year.</p><p>That's a shame, nutrition experts say, because cranberries  deliver a bundle of health benefits. And they're quite efficient: A cup of raw cranberries  carries just 50 calories.</p><p>So why aren't they more of an everyday food? It may come  down to taste.</p><p>\"They're  a little bit more bitter than blueberries or other berries that have those  phytochemicals  and a little bit crunchier,\" said Maya Vadiveloo, an assistant  professor in the Department of Nutrition and Food Sciences at the University of  Rhode Island.</p><p>\"I  think you can start to get used to almost any flavor over time, but I think we  may have this bias that all fruit needs to be sweet,\" she  said. \"It might just be that people have not really thought that much  about cranberries, unless it's around Thanksgiving.\" </p><p>Among the health benefits associated with cranberries:</p><ul>  <li> The vitamins and minerals they contain boost the body's digestive  health and antioxidant system and promote good heart health  even possibly  improving blood pressure and cholesterol.</li>  <li>They are high in fiber. But contrary to common perception,  the most recent research has not definitively shown that cranberry products  help prevent or treat urinary tract infections.</li>  <li>In laboratory studies, they've been linked to a lower risk  of certain types of cancer.</li>  <li>They contain chemicals that may combat norovirus and other  food-borne illnesses.</li></ul><p>\"Cranberries may be a little underutilized,\" Vadiveloo said.  \"They're not nearly as expensive as many other berries, and at Thanksgiving,  the greater variety of fruits and vegetables that you have around  things like  stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy  if you're balancing your plate with a little  bit of everything, you tend to eat less of all the things and still feel very  satisfied.\"</p><p>One popular way to work cranberries into a daily diet all  year long is by adding dried cranberries to a salad. And while cranberries may  taste better when they're dried than when they're raw, that sweetness comes at  a high cost.</p><p>Nutritionally speaking, dried cranberries may be closer to  candy than they are to fruit. A 1/3-cup serving of dried cranberries carries  123 calories. Worse, most of the nutrients found in raw cranberries are nowhere  to be found in the dried version.</p><p>One cup of chopped raw cranberries, for example, contains  14.6 mg of vitamin C per serving, while one cup of dried cranberries contains  0.3 mg.</p><p>\"If you start to think that one of the snack-size Halloween  candies is 60 to 110 calories, you could have two cups of raw cranberries for  that amount  and feel fuller, and have a lot of the beneficial effects,\"  Vadiveloo said.</p><p>Similarly, sweetened cranberry sauce, a Thanksgiving staple,  contains 418 calories with just 5.5 mg of vitamin C per one-cup serving.</p><p>\"For almost any food, the preparation matters,\" Vadiveloo  said. \"Most foods can be healthy, especially in their raw form. But when we  start doing things to them, we need to be more concerned about the health  effects. If you're trying to start eating more cranberries, even if you're  planning to add sweetener, doing it yourself versus buying something that's  already pre-processed is better.</p><p>\"People tend to add far less of their own sweetener than  what's in commercially prepared food.\"</p><p>Another popular way people may try to add cranberries to the  diet is by drinking them. Cranberry juice is often combined with other fruit  juices, such as grape or apple, for a better flavor.</p><p>As with any juice, it's important to consider the amount of  sweetener that's added. Unsweetened cranberry juice contains 116 calories and  23.5 mg of vitamin C per one-cup serving. Also, it's worth noting that  cranberry juice may interact with certain medications.</p><p>And of course, cranberries are popular in muffins. But  depending on how they are made, muffins aren't necessarily a nutritionist's  favorite choice, Vadiveloo said: \"We don't want to see a muffin claim health  benefits just because it has cranberries, you know?\"</p>",

For instance, findings show that a diet high in fiber, especially from fruits and vegetables, can lower stroke risk. Following a DASH-style diet -- which is rich in whole grains and low in red meat -- boosts heart health by lowering blood pressure and cholesterol. And the Mediterranean-style diet, which uses olive oil as the primary fat and encourages mostly plant-based foods, is another great choice for longevity.</p><p>Principles from each of these diets can be combined to raise the overall quality of your diet and help you meet health goals. In fact, a Harvard study found that simply eating more whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and fewer sweetened beverages and less saturated fat can reduce type 2 diabetes risk by about 20 percent.</p><p>People also need to know what's not healthy and should be avoided. Another Harvard study identified key culprits -- potato chips, processed and unprocessed red meat, as well as sugar-sweetened beverages. Starches, refined grains, fats and sugars all lead to weight gain, while increasing high-quality foods can actually help you eat fewer calories overall because they're more satisfying.</p><p>One interesting finding is that the healthiest diets are made up of a rather small range of good-for-you foods. And the concept of eating whatever you want if you do so in moderation isn't the sound approach it was thought to be.</p><p>Boosting diet quality starts at the supermarket. Focus on the perimeter where you'll find produce, low-fat dairy, seafood and poultry, rather than the aisles where packaged and process foods are stocked.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn about the benefits of the <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/dash-eating-plan \" target=\"_new\">DASH diet</a> from the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.</p>",

She couldn't bear to look inside, not knowing if the cozy space would ever be home to their baby.</p> <p>The couple had anticipated their usual complications -- Lisa's first two pregnancies were rough and those children (another son and a daughter) were delivered prematurely. But an ultrasound taken 17 weeks into this pregnancy led to a discovery much more frightening: Their unborn son, Kaden, had a rare congenital heart defect. Instead of having two separate arteries to carry blood to the lungs and body, he had only a large one for the body, thus compromising the lungs. The condition is called truncus arteriosus.</p> <p>Doctors downplayed the diagnosis, saying, \"He'll just have a few heart surgeries and he'll be fine.\" But then Lisa and Chris visited with specialists at Children's Hospital Colorado in Denver.</p> <p>\"You don't understand how bad this is,\" doctors told them, \"and we don't know if we can fix this.\" </p> <p>Adding to their concern was the detection of a second serious issue, a leaky aortic valve.</p> <p>Worst of all, the doctors described a Catch-22 situation: If Lisa delivered Kaden prematurely, he might be too small to operate on; if he went to full term, the stress of the birth would likely leave him in late-stage heart failure.</p> <p>\"I felt like a ticking time bomb,\" she said. \"We had no idea if he could be fixed or if he'd survive the birth.\"</p> <p>Kaden was born six weeks early, on Nov. 5, 2013, sharing a birthday with his father. Unlike Lisa's other two deliveries, there were no complications, so she was able to hold him briefly, which she hadn't been able to do with her son Nathan, now 12, and Emma, 7. </p> <p>\"I wanted to be able to touch my baby first before anyone else,\" she said. \"It was very special. He came out screaming at the top of his lungs and shaking his fists. And although he was a little grayish blue, you could tell he was ready for a fight.\"</p> <p>Still, Chris said, \"We were afraid that in a few days we were going to be saying goodbye to him.\" </p> <p>Six days later, Kaden underwent a surgery to correct his congenital heart defect. Doctors used a conduit to reroute his blood flow. Doctors feared that Kaden wouldn't survive the trauma of the nine-hour operation.</p> <p>\"The doctors were absolutely blown away,\" Lisa said. \"They started calling him Rocky because he was such a fighter.\"</p> <p>The leaky valve remained a threat. However, because Kaden was so small, doctors chose to wait to repair it.</p> <p>\"Those were the worst six months of my life,\" Lisa said. \"I wasn't the mom with a child -- I was the nurse with a patient. It was all about therapies and doctor's visits -- every single field of medicine. He was on oxygen and 12 medications and didn't have the energy to eat, so we had to put a tube directly into his stomach.\"</p> <p>Kaden's breathing eventually became more labored, adding to the urgency of repairing the valve. But doctors said he was still too small.</p> <p>Searching for a solution, their surgeon, Dr. Max Mitchell, read an article about a case in which surgeons came at this same problem in a different way. The next day, he told Lisa and Chris about it. He acknowledged that it was \"extraordinarily high risk\" but he also seemed confident.</p> <p>\"Let's do it,\" they said.</p> <p>The procedure took 13 hours. Finally, Mitchell appeared.</p> <p>\"He was smiling, and we rarely saw him smile,\" Lisa said. \"If he was feeling good, so were we.\"</p> <p>Kaden improved every month, becoming pinker and more energetic. He eventually went off supplemental oxygen and a feeding tube. His immune system continues to strengthen.</p> <p>Four years later, he remains on blood thinners because of his mechanical valve. He'll face more surgeries as his heart endures more wear and tear.</p> <p>\"We welcome the fact that he's great for now, but we also know that harder days will be ahead,\" Chris said. \"And while we don't want to treat Kaden with kid gloves, of course we have to be careful. It's a balancing act.\"</p>",

Most also thought opioids were the most effective treatment for post-surgery pain.</p><p>But experts said that while the drugs do ease pain in the short term, they are not the only option -- or necessarily the best one.</p><p>Prescription opioids -- which include painkillers like OxyContin, Vicodin and codeine -- carry a risk of breathing suppression, overdose and possible addiction.</p><p>But even their more mundane-sounding side effects can be significant, said Dr. Asokumar Buvanendran, who chairs the American Society of Anesthesiology's Pain Committee.</p><p>The drugs can cause constipation, nausea and vomiting, he said -- which are not trivial matters, particularly for older people with medical conditions.</p><p>So surgery patients should discuss all their pain relief options with their doctor, and balance the benefits against the risks, said Buvanendran, who was not involved in the new study.</p><p>\"For more severe acute pain, opioids are effective,\" he said. \"But the question is, are they the best choice for your surgery?\"</p><p>After years of skyrocketing, prescriptions for opioids have been declining in the United States since 2012, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Recently, concern has focused on the rising rate of overdose deaths from illegal opioids -- namely, heroin and illicitly made synthetic fentanyl.</p><p>Still, in 2017, doctors wrote almost 58 opioid prescriptions for every 100 Americans, the CDC says. And nationwide, about 40 percent of opioid overdose deaths involved a prescription drug.</p><p>Various medical groups say doctors should prescribe opioids sparingly for acute pain -- including after surgery. That means prescribing just a small number of pills -- usually a three-day supply or less -- at the lowest dose possible, according to the CDC.</p><p>For the latest study, researchers surveyed 503 adults undergoing surgery at their hospital. The procedures including knee or hip replacements, and back, abdominal or ear/nose/throat surgeries.</p><p>Overall, 77 percent said they expected to get opioids, while 37 percent expected acetaminophen (such as Tylenol), and only 18 percent thought they'd receive ibuprofen (such as Motrin).</p><p>Most patients also believed opioids were the best way to manage post-surgery pain -- including 94 percent of those who expected to receive the drugs.</p><p>Dr. Nirmal Shah presented the findings this weekend at the annual meeting of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, in San Francisco. </p><p>\"People naturally want the most effective pain treatment, and they often assume that means opioids,\" said Shah, an anesthesia resident at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.</p><p>But, he said, the right pain management depends on various factors, including the type of surgery and patients' personal health and pain tolerance.</p><p>Opioids might help for a short time after surgery in the hospital, according to Shah. But ideally, he said, patients should be discharged with other pain-relief plans.</p><p>A second study presented at the meeting found that when it came to back surgery, patients on opioids seemed to fare worse.</p><p>In a review of nine studies, researchers found that patients prescribed opioids after surgery had more pain and gave lower ratings to their quality of life, versus those who used non-drug options -- such as exercise therapy.</p><p>And those who were using opioids for pain relief before surgery generally faced tougher recoveries: They tended to have a longer hospital stay after surgery, and were more likely to be readmitted to the hospital, compared with other patients.</p><p>In an earlier study, Shah said, his team found that relatively younger surgery patients were \"more reluctant\" to use opioids, while older patients had fewer reservations.</p><p>\"That may be because the younger generation is more educated about the opioid epidemic,\" he speculated.</p><p>Yet, Buvanendran said, the side effects of opioids can be more dangerous for older patients.</p><p>Shah suggested that patients talk to their surgical team and their anesthesiologist about what to expect as far as pain, and what can be done about it during surgery, during their hospital stay, and after they go home.</p><p>Findings presented at meetings are generally considered preliminary until they are published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Mayo Clinic has more on <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/pain-medications/art-20046452\" target=\"_new\">pain relief after surgery</a>.</p>",

The agency will also mandate age-verification measures for online sales to prevent minors from buying the flavor pods.</p><p> \"I think that there's a perception that e-cigarettes are a safer alternative for kids,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a recent interview with the <i>Times</i>. \"But it can lead to a lifelong addiction, and some percentage will migrate to combustible products.\" </p><p>So, \"in order to close the on-ramp to e-cigarettes for kids, we have to put in place some speed bumps for adults,\" Gottlieb said, referring to efforts such as the proposed ban.</p><p>The FDA first began its crackdown on flavored e-cigarettes earlier this year, as the number of teens using the products reached epidemic proportions, the <i>Times</i> reported. By far, the leading vaping product is made by Juul, whose e-cigarette devices resemble small computer flash drives. Use of Juul has skyrocketed among teens over the past year, and the company's products now command 70 percent of the market.</p><p>Flavored versions of e-cigarettes -- including chicken and waffles, rocket Popsicle and \"unicorn milk\" -- have boosted sales among the young even further, experts contend.</p><p>\"The availability of flavors in e-cigarettes is one of the top reasons that middle and high school students cite as their motivation for using e-cigarettes,\" said Patricia Folan, director of the Center for Tobacco Control at Northwell Health in Great Neck, N.Y. \"Young people are more likely to try flavored e-cigarettes and consider them less harmful than tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes.\"</p><p>Responding to the trend, the FDA recently warned several e-cigarette makers to stop marketing to teenagers or risk being banned. Major companies were given 60 days to prove they could keep their devices away from minors, and the deadline is this weekend. Companies involved include Juul, RJR Vapor Co.'s Vuse, Imperial Brands' blu and devices made by Logic.</p><p>None of the companies have responded to requests by the <i>Times</i> for comment.</p><p>The FDA also warned 1,100 retailers to stop selling e-cigarettes to minors and fined some of them, the <i>Times</i> reported.</p><p>Folan applauded the FDA's move.</p><p>\"Although the FDA plan is not a complete ban of flavored e-cigarettes, this measure is a very significant step in preventing youth initiation of e-cigarette products, which some studies have shown results in teens smoking combustible cigarettes as well,\" she said.</p><p>The proposed ban comes after months of meetings between the FDA and e-cigarette makers on how to reduce teen use of the devices.</p><p>In a statement last week, Gottlieb said some e-cigarette makers also seemed to support raising the minimum age for buying tobacco products to 21 years, the <i>Times</i> reported.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse has more about <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/electronic-cigarettes-e-cigarettes\" target=\"_new\">e-cigarettes</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Oct. 9, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The quick weight loss that occurs after bariatric surgery seems to have an unintended consequence -- a greater risk of gallstones, a new study suggests. </p><p>The rapid loss of pounds was linked to a 10-fold increase in the hospital admissions for pancreatitis, gallstones and other gallbladder conditions. </p><p>\"Gallstones are quite common in post-bariatric surgery patients. Medications called bile acid sequestrants can help, but patients have to take them several times a day,\" explained study co-author Dr. Violeta Popov. She's an assistant professor of medicine at NYU School of Medicine and Langone Medical Center in New York City. </p><p>In years past, surgeons often removed the gallbladder as part of weight-loss surgeries. However, as weight-loss surgeries have become less invasive, with smaller and smaller incisions, surgeons stopped taking the gallbladder out during the procedure, Popov said. She's also director of bariatric endoscopy at VA New York Harbor Healthcare System. </p><p>The researchers looked at records from a national sample of inpatient admissions and found more than 1.5 million admissions for gallstones, other gallbladder conditions and acute pancreatitis from 2006 to 2014. The average patient age was between 52 and 64 years old. </p><p>The findings showed that there was a 10- to 100-fold higher risk of these conditions in people who had undergone weight-loss surgery. And the average patient age was 43 to 55. </p><p>People who'd had  weight-loss surgery were less likely to die, tended to stay less time in the hospital and their gallbladder disease tended to cost less to treat, the researchers said. </p><p>Dr. David Victor III, an American College of Gastroenterology expert, said it wasn't clear before this study that bariatric surgery boosted the risk of gallstones and other gallbladder conditions. </p><p>\"Obesity is known to increase the risk of gallstones, so patients who have indications for bariatric surgery would have an increased risk of gallstones,\" said Victor, who's also an assistant professor of medicine at the Institute for Academic Medicine at Houston Methodist.</p><p>\"This study is interesting because patients who have bariatric surgery may be at risk for gallstones that we have underappreciated before,\" Victor said.</p><p>Both Victor and Popov said it's too soon to recommend again removing the gallbladder when having weight-loss surgery, but it's a question worthy of additional study.</p><p>Popov said the rapid weight loss is likely what triggers the gallbladder conditions, though the study did not prove that.</p><p> Victor said it's also too soon to know why there's an increased risk, but it could be because people are obese or it may be a technical aspect of the surgery that boosts the risk. And, he added, it's possible the risk is not permanent.</p><p>He agreed that doctors should consider putting patients on bile acid sequestrants to help prevent gallstones and other conditions. </p><p>The study was presented Monday at the American College of Gastroenterology annual meeting, in Philadelphia. Research presented at medical meetings should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. </p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>Learn more about gallstones from the <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/gallstones\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</a>.</p>",

She is a research physician at Avalon University School of Medicine in Willemstad, Curacao.</p><p>Patel cautioned that the study can't prove that using marijuana causes strokes, only that the two are associated.</p><p>\"We can't establish causation, but what we can say is that recreational marijuana users are at higher risk in terms of stroke,\" she said.</p><p>In addition, the researchers don't know if the risk is tied to smoking marijuana or ingesting it in other ways, and whether it depends on the amount of the drug used or if it is due to other psychoactive ingredients mixed in with the marijuana.</p><p>Patel said the risk may be exacerbated by chronic medical conditions of the marijuana users who had strokes, such as diabetes or obesity.</p><p>Also, the researchers could not tell from the data whether marijuana users used other drugs like cocaine or smoked tobacco, she said.</p><p>Still, more strokes occurred among marijuana users than nonusers, which leaves open the question of what accounts for the increase in risk.</p><p>\"At this point we can just say there is this increased risk,\" Patel said.</p><p>The best way to sort out whether marijuana is truly associated with an increase in stroke is in a clinical trial, said Dr. Thalia Field, an assistant professor of neurology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.</p><p>\"It's too early to say that this is causative,\" she said. \"It has to be borne out in other studies.\"</p><p>In the study, Patel and her colleagues found that among more than 2.3 million American  recreational marijuana users who were hospitalized, the risk of stroke rose, compared with people who didn't use the drug.</p><p>Between 2010 and 2014, strokes among marijuana users steadily increased, even though the overall stroke rate remained unchanged, Patel said.</p><p>Among marijuana users in the study, more than 32,000 had a stroke -- including nearly 19,500 who suffered an ischemic stroke. Ischemic strokes occur when a clot blocks blood vessels in the brain.</p><p>Over five years, the rate of all types of stroke increased from 1.3 to 1.5 percent among marijuana users, and the rate of ischemic stroke rose from 0.7 to 0.9 percent, the researchers found.</p><p>The increase in strokes among marijuana users was across all age groups -- for people in their teens to those in their 80s, Patel said. In addition, costs to care for these patients rose between 2010 and 2014, from $71,000 to $92,000, she said.</p><p>The findings were to be presented Friday at the World Stroke Congress, in Montreal. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>Paul Armentano, deputy director of the marijuana advocacy group NORML, said, \"This finding is inconsistent with other population-based studies, which failed to identify cannabis as an independent risk factor for stroke in younger subjects.\" </p><p>NORML, however, recognizes that the data on this subject is evolving and that cannabis smoke can cause a cardiovascular response, he added.  </p><p>People with a history of heart disease or stroke may be at an increased risk for adverse side effects from marijuana, particularly smoked cannabis, Armentano acknowledged.</p><p>\"As with any drug, people should consult their doctor before deciding whether the medical use of cannabis is safe and appropriate,\" he said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"http://www.stroke.org/understand-stroke/what-stroke\" target=\"_new\">National Stroke Association</a> for more on strokes.</p>",

Some of the parents also used the leftover antibiotics themselves.</p><p>A common reason parents gave for keeping unused antibiotics was to avoid the cost of a second trip to the doctor.</p><p>The dosage of the unused antibiotics given to others was typically the prescribed dosage, or was estimated based on the age of the child, the study authors said.</p><p>The survey also found that 16 percent of parents said they'd given adult medications to their children.</p><p>Milanaik said more needs to be done to educate parents about antibiotics and the risks of taking them without proper medical consultation.</p><p>\"Although the discovery of antibiotics has revolutionized medicine, it is imperative that clinicians emphasize the importance of [proper use and disposal of these medications] to make sure they remain an effective tool against infectious diseases,\" she said.</p><p> Research presented at meetings should be considered preliminary unless published in a peer-reviewed journal. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians has more on <a href=\"https://familydoctor.org/antibiotic-resistance/?adfree=true\" target=\"_new\">antibiotics</a>.</p>",

Currently, 10 states permit recreational marijuana use and 33 allow medical use of the drug.</p><p>Among the parents in the study, smoking was the most common form of marijuana use (30 percent), followed by edibles (14.5 percent) and vaporizers (9.6 percent), the investigators found.</p><p>Urine samples were collected from the parents' children. Those samples revealed that 46 percent of the youngsters had detectable levels of the marijuana metabolite tetrahydrocannabinol carboxylic acid (COOH-THC), and 11 percent had detectable levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.</p><p>THC is an indicator of both recent and active exposure to marijuana, and a higher level of exposure overall.</p><p>\"These are worrisome results, suggesting nearly half of the children of parents who smoke marijuana are getting exposed, and 11 percent are exposed to a much greater degree,\" Wilson said.</p><p>Most parents (84 percent) said no one ever smoked marijuana inside their homes, while 7.4 percent said marijuana was smoked in their home daily, the researchers said.</p><p>When asked what happened if someone wanted to smoke marijuana in the home while the children were present, 52 percent of parents said there was no smoking when children were home, 22 percent stepped outside, and nearly one in 10 smoked in another room or another floor.</p><p>One-third of children whose parents stepped outside to smoke tested positive for COOH-THC, according to the report published online Nov. 19 in <i>Pediatrics</i>.</p><p>\"Stepping outside might sound like a good idea, but the evidence we collected suggests that kids are still getting exposed through secondhand or possibly thirdhand smoke exposure,\" Wilson said.</p><p>\"We know that thirdhand smoke -- smoke that lingers in our hair, our clothes, even our skin -- results in biological exposure that we can detect. What remains unclear is the extent and consequence of this mechanism of exposure,\" Wilson explained.</p><p>\"Our findings suggest that smoking in the home, even in a different room, results in exposure to children. The more we understand secondhand and thirdhand smoke exposure, the better we can protect children in the home in states where marijuana is legal,\" she added.</p><p>Tobacco and marijuana smoke contain similar harmful chemicals, the researchers noted.</p><p>The study authors pointed out that most states that permit marijuana use don't allow it in public indoor and outdoor spaces,  but do not have restrictions on smoking marijuana in the presence of children.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation has more on <a href=\"https://no-smoke.org/secondhand-marijuana-smoke-fact-sheet/\" target=\"_new\">secondhand marijuana smoke</a>.</p>",

You may also have a higher risk of complications during labor.</p><p>Just as it's now recommended to start taking supplemental nutrients such as folic acid before getting pregnant, talk to your primary care doctor or your ob-gyn about steps you can take to lose weight. Those steps can include improving your diet and getting more exercise as part of a multi-prong way to shed pounds well before you try to conceive. Also work with your healthcare provider to get any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, under good control.</p><p>Know that your starting weight is now used to determine what you should gain during pregnancy. The guideline for an average weight gain during pregnancy is 25 to 35 pounds if you're at normal weight.</p><p>But if you're overweight, with a body mass index between 25 and 29.9, you should gain only 15 to 25 pounds. And if you're obese, with a body mass index of 30 or higher, the recommendation is for a pregnancy weight gain of between 11 to 20 pounds.</p><p>It's very hard to get through pregnancy without gaining more weight than you planned. But if you can start out close to your ideal weight, you'll have fewer pounds to lose to regain your shape after baby comes.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has detailed information on <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Obesity-and-Pregnancy\" target=\"_new\">obesity and pregnancy</a>.</p>",

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently launched an ambitious campaign to warn teens about the dangers of e-cigarettes and to stop Juul sales to young people.</p><p>Juul devices resemble a traditional USB flash drive, but they pack a potent nicotine punch. Each colorful e-liquid pod contains as much nicotine as a pack-and-a-half to two packs of traditional cigarettes, Halpern-Felsher said.</p><p>Experts are concerned that Juuls are tailor-made to target a youth audience, given the sleek look of the devices and the fact that the pods come in many different fruit and candy flavors.</p><p>Juul Labs responded to the new study with a statement denying the products' appeal to young people.</p><p>\"We agree that underage use of Juul is completely unacceptable and it is directly opposed to our mission of eliminating cigarettes by offering existing adult smokers a true alternative to combustible cigarettes. We stand committed to working with those who want to keep nicotine products out of the hands of young people,\" the company said in a statement.</p><p>For the study, the researchers asked 445 California teens and young adults about their knowledge of and use of Juul, as part of a larger tobacco study that's been ongoing since 2014.</p><p>About half of the participants had heard of Juul, and around 16 percent had used the brand -- fewer than had used other forms of e-cigarettes (30 percent) or conventional tobacco cigarettes (24 percent).</p><p>But Juul users reported using their device more often over the past week and past month than either smokers or other e-cigarette users, the findings showed.</p><p>Juul users had vaped an average 1.5 days during the past week, and 6.7 days within the past month.</p><p>By comparison, cigarette users smoked an average 0.7 days during the past week and 3 days within the past month. Users of other types of e-cigarettes vaped 0.8 days within the past week and 3.2 days during the past month.</p><p>Juul users also scored as high as users of other e-cigarettes on the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist, a questionnaire designed to gauge nicotine addiction, the researchers found.</p><p>Flavors appeared to be attractive to Juul users. About 28 percent said their first pod ever vaped was fruit-flavored and 27 percent said it was menthol or mint-flavored, according to the report.</p><p>\"Youth are using more the fruit- and mint-flavored,\" Halpern-Felsher said. \"That's what's attracting them to using these products, whereas if you kept Juul as a product that was more for adults and only flavored like classic tobacco, youth may not be using them.\"</p><p>Halpern-Felsher added that she's very concerned that teenagers are creating a lifelong addiction by using Juul.</p><p>\"In young people with developing brains, you can become addicted with a few cigarettes if you're using regularly,\" Halpern-Felsher said. \"We do know from other vaping products that adolescents and young adults who use those products are significantly more likely to go on to use a combustible cigarette product.\"</p><p>But Dr. Christy Sadreameli, a spokeswoman for the American Lung Association, said that even if teens don't move on to smoking cigarettes after using Juul, they are still creating an addiction that will cost them.</p><p>\"I would say even if they just stay with Juul forever, indefinitely, they've created an addiction that's going to be expensive. It may be life-long,\" Sadreameli said. </p><p>\"It's much more likely to be a permanent thing, because teens have an underdeveloped prefrontal cortex of their brain. They're more likely to get addicted, in general,\" she explained. \"Using a very high-potency nicotine product during that vulnerable period of life, it's just a bad combination.\"</p><p>Action needs to be taken to remove flavors from all e-cigarettes, including Juul, Halpern-Felsher said. Regulators also should step in and block advertising that targets teenagers.</p><p>\"Youth, when shown advertisements for flavored vapes, they really believe those ads are targeting them,\" Halpern-Felsher said. \"We really need to get flavors out of the products and out of the ads.\"</p><p>The new study was published online Oct. 19 in the journal <i>JAMA Network Open</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Cancer Institute has more about the <a href=\"https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/tcrb/guide-measures/honc.html\" target=\"_new\">Hooked on Nicotine Checklist</a>.</p>",

About half were born sooner than 32 weeks' gestation and/or under 3.3 pounds. The others were born full-term.</p><p>The children's head circumference was checked at birth, 5 months, 20 months and 4 years of age. The kids then took intelligence tests at 6 and 8 years, and at 26 years of age.</p><p>The very premature/very low birth weight infants had smaller heads at birth, but between birth and 20 months their heads grew relatively faster than that of full-term children because they had to catch up, the researchers said.</p><p>Study first author Julia Jaekel, of the University of Tennessee, noted that \"those who showed faster head growth, whether preterm or term-born, had higher intelligence scores at 26 years.\"</p><p>In addition, the findings showed that \"catch-up head growth was particularly beneficial for intelligence scores in very premature and very low birth weight children.

This means blood can pool and form clots that go to the brain, causing a stroke. </p><p>The good news from this study: Blood thinners can reduce the odds for stroke and maybe delay or prevent dementia, researchers say. </p><p>\"Our findings emphasize the need to improve the clinical management of patients with atrial fibrillation, which is very important since a considerable proportion of older people with atrial fibrillation are not using [anti-clotting] drugs,\" said study first author Mozhu Ding. She is with the Aging Research Center at the Karolinska Institute in Solna, Sweden. </p><p>For the study, Ding and her colleagues collected data on nearly 2,700 Swedes, average age 73. </p><p>Participants were examined at the start of the study and again after six years if they were younger than 78 or every three years for those older than that. None had dementia at the outset, and 9 percent had atrial fibrillation.</p><p>Over the study period, an additional 11 percent developed A-fib, and 15 percent developed dementia.</p><p>The researchers found that thinking and memory skills declined faster among those who had atrial fibrillation. They were 40 percent more likely to develop dementia than those without the heart condition.</p><p>However, those who took blood thinners because of the heart disorder had a 60 percent lower risk of developing dementia -- 11 percent taking anti-clot drugs developed dementia compared to 22 percent not taking them. No decreased risk was seen among those taking aspirin, the researchers found.</p><p>This study is observational, so it cannot prove that A-fib is a cause of dementia or that blood thinners prevent it. Still, the researchers believe additional efforts should be made to increase blood thinner use among older people with atrial fibrillation.</p><p>One limitation of the study is that Ding's group did not distinguish between different types of atrial fibrillation. Also, some A-fib cases may have been missed among those who didn't have symptoms.</p><p>One specialist said even tiny strokes that go unnoticed can be a gateway to dementia. </p><p>\"Atrial fibrillation is associated with formation of clots that travel to the brain,\" said Dr. Sam Gandy, director of the Mount Sinai Center for Cognitive Health in New York City. </p><p>It's been thought that blood thinners effectively prevent this, he said. </p><p>\"But with more refined neuropsychological exams and higher resolution scans we now see that while we are preventing major strokes, we apparently are not preventing formation of micro-clots that do more damage than previously realized,\" Gandy said. \"This is being recognized and documented more and more, as in the current study.\" </p><p>The report was published online Oct. 10 in the journal <i>Neurology</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Alzheimer's Association offers more details on <a href=\"https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia\" target=\"_new\">dementia</a>.</p>",

So now families have to go back every 3 months and pay $300 to get their temporary medical exemption updated.\"</p><p>These doctors are flying in the face of decades of work to develop and improve vaccines that \"beat back infectious diseases that plagued humanity since the species evolved,\" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore.</p><p>\"To hear of physicians advertising to issue medical exemptions, which are mostly unwarranted, is to spit in the face of those pioneers who gave us vaccines, and has made those physicians advocates of the primitive Dark Ages when vaccine-preventable diseases flourished,\" Adalja said.</p><p>The 2015 law made California the first state in nearly 35 years to eliminate personal belief exemptions for mandatory vaccinations, the study authors said in background notes. The law was prompted in part by a 2014 measles outbreak at Disneyland.</p><p>The law has had a positive effect on immunization rates overall in California, the researchers reported.</p><p>Following the law's implementation, the proportion of kindergartners who received all required vaccines increased to 95.1 percent in 2017-2018, up from 92.8 percent in 2015-2016.</p><p>The findings were published online Oct. 29 in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i>.</p><p>To get a ground-level assessment of the law's rollout, researchers interviewed 40 health officers representing about half of the local health jurisdictions in California.</p><p>The public health officials said they are concerned anti-vaccine parents denied personal belief exemptions for their children now are seeking out doctors willing to issue medical exemptions for a fee, Mohanty said.</p><p>Many of these medical exemptions cite conditions typically not considered barriers to immunization by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, such as a family history of allergies or autoimmune disorders, Mohanty said.</p><p>However, these conditions squeak by based on the regulatory language of the law, she said.</p><p>The number of medical exemptions issued has not yet reached the level of personal belief exemptions claimed prior to the law's passage, which for the 2015-2016 school year was about 2.4 percent, Mohanty said.</p><p>But if left unchecked, the rapid increase of medical exemptions could weaken vaccine protection for school kids, said Democratic state Sen. Dr. Richard Pan, a pediatrician and author of the California law.</p><p>\"They threaten community immunity and threaten the health of all children,\" Pan said of the exemptions.</p><p>Anti-vaccine parent groups appear to be sharing lists of doctors willing to issue medical exemptions for a fee, Pan said.</p><p>\"It's a very small number, but that's all it takes, right?\" said Pan, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study. \"They're charging $500 or more a pop for these exemptions, so they're definitely in it for the money.\"</p><p>Some of these doctors have been brought before the California Medical Board on ethics charges, the study reported.</p><p>But Pan suggested a more straightforward solution. He'd like to amend California law so public health officials would have the power to revoke doctors' authority to issue medical exemptions.</p><p>Pan argued the power to issue medical exemptions is a state-level public health function that has been delegated to doctors, and therefore could be rescinded if it's found they're taking advantage of patients.</p> <p>For example, West Virginia pediatricians do not have the ability to issue medical exemptions -- instead, they must apply to their state health department for exemptions on patients' behalf, Pan noted.</p><p>\"When someone abuses that authority that's been delegated to them, then the state should be able to take back that authority from that person,\" Pan said. \"And not only revoke that authority but then invalidate all of the medical exemptions that have been inappropriately written, as a threat to public health.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have more about <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/laws/state-reqs.html\" target=\"_new\">state vaccination requirements</a>.</p>",

He's assistant professor at the Litwin-Zucker Center for Alzheimer's Disease and Memory Disorders at The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, N.Y.</p> <p>In the new study, conducted on autopsied brains, Haroutunian and his colleagues developed a way to separate the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) in the brain from adjacent brain tissue. </p><p>They first used this method on the brains of 34 people who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and type 2 diabetes treated with standard diabetes drugs.</p><p>The researchers then compared those findings to an examination of 30 brains from people with Alzheimer's who did not have diabetes, and 19 brains of people who had experienced neither disease.</p><p>The study focused on changes in certain genetic \"markers\" tied closely to proper brain signaling.</p><p>According to the researchers, levels of about half of these markers were lower in the vessels and brain tissue of patients who had both Alzheimer's and diabetes. And the majority of the unhealthy genetic changes that are usually seen in Alzheimer's were missing in patients who had taken diabetes drugs. </p> <p>This all suggests that diabetes medications have a protective effect on the brains of Alzheimer's patients, the researchers said, which in turn might boost the search for effective therapies.</p><p>\"Most modern Alzheimer's treatments target amyloid plaques and haven't succeeded in effectively treating the disease,\" Haroutunian said in a Mount Sinai news release.</p><p>But the new study focused on \"insulin and diabetes medications such as metformin, [which are] FDA-approved and safely administered to millions of people,\" he said.</p><p>The new study suggests these drugs may \"have a beneficial effect on people with Alzheimer's,\" Haroutunian said. \"This opens opportunities to conduct research trials on people using similar drugs or on drugs that have similar effects on the brains' biological pathways and cell types identified in this study.\"</p><p>For his part, Giliberto said the results \"are not surprising,\" since experts have long noted links between diabetes' effects on blood sugar and blood vessel health, and brain health.</p><p>But he added that the study doesn't prove that these issues cause Alzheimer's, or whether diabetes medications could curb or stop the brain-wasting disease once it had begun.</p><p>However, \"treating chronic hyperglycemia will result in a reduction of further brain insult,\" Giliberto reasoned. For people with Alzheimer's disease, that \"might result in better cognitive performance and quality of life,\" he said.</p><p>Dr. Satjit Bhusri is a cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. Reviewing the study, he said it \"establishes a relationship between the blood vessels of the brain and Alzheimer's disease.\"</p><p>The findings could \"open the door to a new pathway that may be of therapeutic use in patients with Alzheimer's disease,\" Bhusri said.</p><p>The report was published online Nov. 1 in the journal <i>PLOS One</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Alzheimer's Association offers more on <a href=\"https://www.alz.org\" target=\"_new\">Alzheimer's disease</a>.</p>",

Any dispute about a person's sex would have to be settled through genetic testing.</p><p>\"The sex listed on a person's birth certificate, as originally issued, shall constitute definitive proof of a person's sex unless rebutted by reliable genetic evidence,\" according to the proposed HHS definition, <i>The Times</i> reported.</p><p>After more than a year of discussions, HHS is expected to formally present the new definition to the Justice Department before the end of the year, according to Trump administration officials.</p><p>If the Justice Department decides that the new definition is legal, it can be enforced across government agencies.</p><p>The new definition would halt federal recognition of about 1.4 million people who recognize themselves as a gender other than the one they were born into, <i>The Times</i> reported.</p><p>\"This takes a position that what the medical community understands about their patients -- what people understand about themselves -- is irrelevant because the government disagrees,\" Catherine Lhamon, who led the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights in the Obama administration and helped write transgender guidance, told <i>The Times</i>.</p><p>This is the latest in a series of Trump administration attempts to reverse recognition and protections of transgender people. It has sought to prevent transgender people from serving in the military and has legally challenged transgender civil rights protections in the health care law.</p><p>\"Transgender people are frightened,\" Sarah Warbelow, the legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, which promotes the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, told <i>The Times</i>.</p><p>\"At every step where the administration has had the choice, they've opted to turn their back on transgender people,\" Warbelow said.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Immunotherapy-Chemo Combo Extends Lives of Women With Aggressive Breast Cancer</b></span></p><p>Treatment with immunotherapy plus chemotherapy extended the lives of women with an aggressive form of breast cancer longer than chemotherapy alone, researchers report.</p><p>The findings could lead to the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of an immunotherapy drug to treat breast cancer and may change the standard of care for women with advanced triple-negative breast cancer, according to <i>The New York Times</i>.</p><p>Triple-negative tumors occur in only about 15 percent of patients with invasive breast cancer in the United States (nearly 40,000 each year), but account for as many as 30 to 40 percent of breast cancer deaths.</p><p>The study included 902 patients treated at 246 medical centers in 41 countries. Half received chemotherapy alone (nab-paclitaxel/Abraxane), and half received chemotherapy plus Genentech's immunotherapy drug atezolizumab (Tecentriq), <i>The Times</i> reported.</p><p>Atezolizumab belongs to a class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, which help immune system T-cells recognize cancer and attack it.</p><p>Median survival was 17.6 months among those who received chemotherapy alone and 21.3 months among those who received the combination therapy. That difference was not statistically significant.</p><p>But among women with a marker called PD-L1 on their cancer cells, median survival was 15.5 months among those who received chemotherapy alone and 25 months in the combination group.</p><p>Those results have not been analyzed statistically, and the patients are still being followed, <i>The Times</i> reported.</p><p>The study was published Oct. 20 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> and was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology annual meeting in Munich.</p><p>Genentech has submitted the data to the FDA  to get approval of atezolizumab for treatment of triple-negative patients with the PD-L1 marker.</p><p>\"This is truly a game changer,\" study author Dr. Sylvia Adams, from NYU Langone Health's Perlmutter Cancer Center, told <i>The Times</i>.</p><p>She noted that cancer patients with the PD-L1 marker tend to respond better to checkpoint inhibitors than those without it. The marker was present in 41 percent of patients in this study.</p><p>After initial treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy, some patients have been doing well for two or three years with immunotherapy alone, Adams told <i>The Times</i>.</p><p>She added that the \"million-dollar question\" is whether they can safely stop the immunotherapy if they have no sign of cancer. For now, they are continuing with immunotherapy.</p><p>While she has received no payments from drug companies, her medical center did receive funding from Genentech to pay for the research, Adams said.</p><p>The new study \"is a big deal and has been the buzz of the breast cancer research world,\" Dr. Larry Norton, of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, told <i>The Times</i>.</p><p>He was not involved in the study, but has done paid consulting work for the past two years for Genentech.</p><p>The study results are \"very significant\" and it seems that chemotherapy \"takes away the invisibility cloak the cancer has managed to put on,\" Dr. Ingrid Mayer, a breast cancer specialist at Vanderbilt University, told <i>The Times</i>.</p><p>She was not part of the study, but has received consulting fees from seven drug companies, including Genentech.</p><p>The chemotherapy may help trigger the immune system, in part by killing cancer cells that then leak compounds that T-cells detect and begin to hunt, Mayer explained.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Ready-to-Eat Salads Recalled</b></span></p><p>Possible salmonella and listeria contamination has led to the recall of ready-to-eat salads sold at Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and other stores, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) said.</p><p>A number of companies have announced recalls.

He worked on the study while studying health care policy at the University of Michigan.</p><p>The results show out-of-pocket costs matter a great deal to patients facing weight-loss (bariatric) surgery, Rozier said in a university news release.</p><p>The survey of 800 adults considering obesity surgery also found that the most commonly performed operation, sleeve gastrectomy, doesn't meet patients' highest priorities.</p><p>With sleeve gastrectomy, a portion of the stomach is removed, leaving a thinner stomach. With a gastric bypass, the stomach is made much smaller and rerouted to bypass part of the small intestine. Patients who have sleeve gastrectomy lose less weight the first year, on average, than patients who have gastric bypass surgery, according to the university research team. </p><p>\"We know there may be slightly better weight loss and increased comorbidity resolution [more weight-related health issues solved] with bypass, so recommending sleeve gastrectomy may be somewhat different than what patients in this study valued,\" said study co-author Dr. Amir Ghaferi, a bariatric surgeon at Michigan Medicine.</p><p>The findings can help doctors guide conversations with patients pondering weight-loss surgery, the researchers said.</p><p>They noted that even though cost is a main consideration for patients, health care providers are rarely trained to discuss that issue.</p><p>\"We probably need to figure out an appropriate way to incorporate cost into conversations providers have with their patients,\" said Rozier, now an assistant professor of health management and policy at Saint Louis University.</p><p>The study was published Nov. 28 in the journal <i>JAMA Surgery</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases has more on <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/bariatric-surgery\" target=\"_new\">weight-loss surgery</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Oct. 11, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Lesbian and gay couples might one day be able to produce offspring that share genetic traits from both parents, a study in mice has determined.</p><p>Researchers with the Chinese Academy of Sciences produced 29 healthy mouse pups from two mothers using stem cells and targeted gene editing, according to a new report.</p><p>\"Not only were they born, the reassuring part was that these pups went ahead and had offspring of their own later on,\" said Dr. Tomer Singer, director of reproductive endocrinology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>\"They were healthy enough to reproduce, which is important,\" added Singer, who was not involved in the experiment. </p><p>The Chinese research team also produced 12 live offspring from two genetic fathers, but the process was more complicated and the offspring lived only a few days. </p><p>Nevertheless, \"this study is a very important first step to prove the concept that in mammals, you may not need a male and a female parent,\" Singer said.</p><p>Still, experts note that research in animals often doesn't pan out in humans.</p><p>The research was published online Oct. 11 in the journal <i>Cell Stem Cell</i>. </p><p>Some reptiles, fish and amphibians can have babies without requiring sperm from a father and an egg from a mother, but that's not the case with mammals, said co-senior study author Qi Zhou. He is a professor with the Institute of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.</p><p>\"We were interested in the question of why mammals can only undergo sexual reproduction,\" Zhou said in a journal news release.</p><p>For their experiment, the investigators relied on haploid embryonic stem cells. Haploid stem cells contain half the number of  chromosomes and DNA as normal stem cells, which typically have a blend of genetic material from both parents.</p><p> Singer explained that the researchers \"removed half of the genetic material because that's what happens in nature, once the sperm penetrates the egg. Half of the genetic material comes from the mom, and half comes from the dad.\"</p><p>But there was another reproductive hurdle that had to be overcome --  that of genomic imprinting.</p><p>Mammals inherit two working copies of most genes, one from mom and one from dad. But in specific cases, genes are \"imprinted\" and mammals inherit only one working copy -- either from the dad or the mom.</p><p>\"This is a very important step in reproduction that essentially shuts down some genes once the egg and sperm are fertilized and create an embryo,\" Singer said.</p><p>In mice, more than 100 genes have been confirmed to be imprinted, and about 50 imprinted genes have been detected in humans, according to a 2013 report in the journal <i>Molecular Aspects of Medicine</i>.</p><p>Inadequate genomic imprinting can cause reproductive failure, as well as severe developmental abnormalities, cancer and other health problems in babies who survive.</p><p>To get around this, the Chinese researchers deleted three genes involved in imprinting from the genetic information derived from the female mouse pair, and seven genes from the male mouse pair.</p><p>For the female couple, the process was relatively simple, according to the report. The haploid stem cells from one female essentially acted as sperm that was then injected into an egg from the other female mouse, who carried the pups to term.</p><p>The male couple required a donated empty egg from a female mouse. Into it went a blend of the two males' edited genetic information. A female mouse also was required to serve as a surrogate mother, carrying the male/male progeny to term.</p><p>Offspring from the male couple was not viable, probably because the correct imprinted genes were not deleted, Singer said.</p><p>\"It's either that they didn't shut down enough genes or too many genes or the wrong genes,\" Singer suggested.</p><p>For this process to work in humans, researchers would have to figure out which imprinted genes would need to be deleted in both women and men, he noted.</p><p>Scientists last year isolated and replicated the very first haploid human stem cells. But Singer predicts it will take decades to identify the specific imprinted genes that would need to be shut down to allow for healthy same-sex reproduction in humans.</p><p>Getting it wrong could cause birth defects, as well as other health problems that might not emerge for decades, Singer added.</p><p>\"That brings us to an ethical dilemma,\" he said. \"Are we creating a generation of animals and, in the future, human beings where we cannot predict how this will affect them? Will they have the life expectancy, will they develop cancer or heart disease or mental retardation or autism or other conditions?\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The University of Utah has more about <a href=\"https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/epigenetics/imprinting/\" target=\"_new\">genomic imprinting</a>.</p>",

Gout is caused by hyperuricemia -- high blood levels of uric acid, which forms crystals that collect around the joints.</p><p>In the study, New Zealand researchers analyzed genetic and diet data from nearly 17,000 American men and women of European ancestry.</p><p>The investigators found that diet was much less important than the individual patient's genes in deciding whether or not they would develop hyperuricemia.</p><p>The findings \"are important in showing the relative contributions of overall diet and inherited genetic factors\" in gout, wrote a team led by Dr. Tony Merriman of the University of Otago.</p><p>In a related editorial, rheumatologist Dr. Ed Roddy, of Keele University in the United Kingdom, said the findings have important psychological implications for patients.</p><p>That's because people with gout often face stigma due to the misconception that gout is a \"self-inflicted\" condition, caused by unhealthy lifestyle habits. That, in turn, can make some patients reluctant to seek medical help.</p><p>But the new research \"provides important evidence that much of patients' preponderance to hyperuricemia and gout is [genetic and] non-modifiable, countering these harmful but well-established views and practices,\" Roddy said.</p><p>For centuries, diet was considered the main risk factor for gout, and recent studies suggest that certain foods such as meat, shellfish, alcohol and sugary soft drinks are associated with a higher risk of gout, while other foods such as fruit, vegetables, low-fat dairy products and coffee may protect against gout.</p><p>But other studies have also shown that genetics plays an important role in gout.</p><p>Dr. Waseem Mir is a rheumatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.  The new findings are \"consistent with what I see in clinical practice,\" he said.</p><p>\"There is a lot of misunderstanding amongst patients as to why they are getting gout attacks. Diet seems to play little role even in clinical practice,\" he said. </p> <p>\"What we learn from this study is that it is a genetic problem and needs to be addressed with medication and not just diet in most cases,\" Mir added.</p><p>The study was published online Oct. 11 in the <i>BMJ</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases has more on <a href=\"https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/gout\" target=\"_new\">gout</a>.</p>",

And with massive rainfall and 13-foot storm surges, flooding is a major danger as the storm tracks northward.</p><p>\"Floodwater places virtually all people at risk for drowning, even for experienced swimmers,\" warned Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"Fast-moving water can be lethal, and even shallow-appearing water can be deadly for toddlers and small children.\"</p><p>He stressed that trying to outrun the storm has its own dangers.</p><p>\"It's important to realize that vehicles do not guarantee sufficient protection from fast-moving floodwaters, as it's possible to stall out or be swept away in fast-moving water,\" Glatter said.</p><p>He added that the storm surge associated with a hurricane is particularly dangerous, especially if you live near the ocean, lakes or streams, which can rapidly overflow and lead to drowning.</p><p>One potentially lifesaving tip: \"Never drive into a standing pool of water on a road after a hurricane, as the water may rise rapidly and trap you in your vehicle,\" Glatter said.</p><p>Already, at least two people have died due to Michael -- a man from Greensboro, Fla., was killed when a tree crashed onto his home, and a girl in Seminole County, Ga., died when debris hit her home, <i>The New York Times</i> reported. Winds from the category 4 storm have topped 150 miles per hour.</p><p>\"It's vital to respect this dangerous time, and make plans to stay abreast of news alerts and keep in touch with family,\" Glatter said.</p><p>The aftermath of serious flooding brings other hazards, he said.</p><p>Flooded areas pose risks for fire hazards or electrical injury associated with downed power lines. \"Never approach a downed power line, as the risk of being electrocuted always exists,\" Glatter said. If you come upon one, contact the power company. </p><p>Floods may also increase the spread of waterborne diseases, including cholera, typhoid fever, hepatitis A, as well as leptospirosis.</p> <p>\"While most floods do not result in serious outbreaks of infectious disease or chemical toxicity, they can result in bacterial and viral infections involving the lung and GI tract in those who are exposed to contaminated floodwater,\" Glatter explained.</p><p>Waterborne infection may occur after washing, drinking or bathing in contaminated water, or by eating infected food. It's essential to boil all water for bathing, brushing your teeth or drinking after a flood, the ER doctor said. Bottled water is the safest bet. </p><p>\"Use only bottled water until the water supply is declared safe,\" Glatter said.</p><p>Hurricane Michael is tracking northward through the Carolinas, before it will make its way to the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>For anyone who still has time to evacuate, Glatter offered this advice:</p><ul><li>Have a family communications plan in case you get separated during the storm. Take your cellphone, and if it uses replaceable batteries, take extras. </li> <li>Carry a one- to two-week supply of any prescription medications. (Diabetics should keep extra insulin on hand, as well as a ready supply of snacks in case their sugar level drops. Store insulin or any liquid antibiotics on ice or cold packs during power failures. Have a list of your doctors with their contact information.</li><li>Patients who use a CPAP machine for sleep apnea or COPD may need an alternative power source during the storm. This includes a CPAP battery pack or marine battery adapters in case of electrical outage.</li><li>Take bottled water (at least 1 gallon daily per person for three to seven days).</li><li>Pack enough nonperishable food for three to seven days.</li><li>Take a flashlight with extra batteries, road maps, basic tools (pliers, wrench, duct tape), cash and coins, sleeping bags.</li><li>Store important documents in a water-resistant container or plastic bag.</li><li>Pack a first aid kit with ibuprofen, acetaminophen, antacids, adhesive tape, Benadryl (for any allergic reactions), motion-sickness medicine, alcohol wipes, forceps and tweezers, instant cold packs, bandage scissors, sterile gauze, elastic wraps, antiseptic solution, adhesive bandages, triple antibiotic ointment, exam gloves, gauze sponges (4 inch-by-4 inch), butterfly tape, sterile saline, hydrogen peroxide, and thermometer with extra batteries.</li><li>For infants, have plenty of diapers and wipes available, as well as formula, powdered milk and extra sanitized bottles.</li><li>Take along an extra pair of contact lenses or eyeglasses with cleaner.</li></ul><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the American Red Cross for more on <a href=\"https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/hurricane.html\" target=\"_new\">hurricane safety</a>.</p>",

She is head of family medicine and primary health care at Ghent University in Belgium.</p><p>Certain decongestants \"can have serious side-effects, such as hypertension, excitation and convulsions,\" De Sutter said.</p><p>The new evidence review lends additional weight to a 2008 warning issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that no cough and cold product should be given to children younger than 2, and they should be used only with caution in older kids.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics also recommends against the use of OTC cough and cold remedies for children younger than 4, said Dr. Jeffrey Gerber, medical director of the Antimicrobial Stewardship Program at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.</p><p>\"Generally speaking, at best in adults the risks and benefits are probably around equal. And in kids the risks outweigh the benefits,\" Gerber said.</p><p>The common cold is usually caused by viruses, and symptoms usually clear in seven to 10 days, the study authors noted in background notes. Children get about six to eight colds a year, compared with two to four colds annually for adults.</p><p>Current evidence from clinical trials shows decongestants provide little to no relief for children, the researchers said.</p><p>The study authors concluded that decongestants or medicines containing antihistamines should not be given to children under 6, and used with caution in children aged 6 to 12.</p><p>The tradeoff simply isn't worth it, Gerber said, even if the chances of a severe side-effect are minimal.</p><p>\"You can have interactions that can make your heart race, for example,\" he explained. \"If you had some type of underlying condition you may or may not know about, you could exacerbate that and cause an arrhythmia. That doesn't happen so often, but it is a possibility.\"</p><p>The OTC remedies don't work much better for adults, the study found. Using decongestants either alone or with antihistamines or pain relievers can have a small effect on blocked or runny noses, for up to three to seven days, the researchers said.</p><p>But adults run an increased risk of side-effects like insomnia, drowsiness, headache or stomach upset, the findings showed. Ironically, long-term use of decongestants can lead to chronic nasal congestion.</p><p>There's also inadequate evidence supporting other commonly used OTC or home treatments, such as steam, heated air humidifiers, analgesics, vapor rub, echinacea or probiotics, the report said.</p><p>Saline nasal irrigation or drops are a parent's safest way to relieve a child's stuffy nose, according to the report, but these may not work.</p><p>Parents can use acetaminophen (children's Tylenol) or ibuprofen (children's Motrin) to reduce fever, aches and pains in children, and a cool-mist humidifier can help nasal passages shrink to allow for easier breathing, the FDA suggests. In addition, kids should drink plenty of fluids to remain hydrated.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has more about <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/specialfeatures/ucm263948.htm\" target=\"_new\">cough and cold products and kids</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Oct. 11, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- While rates of colon cancer have declined among people 50 and older, they're on the rise for younger Americans. Now, new research suggests widening waistlines may be one reason why.</p><p>In the study, women aged 20 to 49 who were overweight or obese had up to twice the risk for colon cancer before age 50, compared with normal-weight women.</p><p>\"Our findings really highlight the importance of maintaining a healthy weight, beginning in early adulthood, for the prevention of early onset colorectal cancer,\" said study co-author Yin Cao. She's an assistant professor of surgery at Washington University in St. Louis.  </p><p>Even though obesity has been floated as a possible reason for rising colon cancer rates among the young, \"we were surprised by the strength of the link,\" Cao said in a university news release.</p><p>The study wasn't designed to prove cause and effect, only an association. But one colon cancer expert wasn't surprised by the finding.</p><p>Dr. Jeffrey Aronoff, a colorectal surgeon at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, noted that obesity has long been a risk factor for colon cancer in people over 50. \"I do believe that a healthy lifestyle, which includes diet, exercise,\" may help curb even younger people's odds for the disease, he said.</p><p>In the new study, Cao and her colleagues collected data on more than 85,000 U.S. women ages 25 to 44 who took part in a large, ongoing study.</p><p>Women who were heavy as teens and gained weight in early adulthood had an increased risk of colon cancer before age 50, the researchers found.</p><p>In fact, they estimated that about 22 percent of early onset colon cancers could have been prevented if those who were diagnosed had maintained a healthy weight. Across the whole American population, that could represent thousands of cases of early onset colon cancer that might be prevented.</p><p>The risk of early onset colon cancer for overweight and obese women was the same regardless of whether or not the woman had a family history of the disease. </p><p>Cao and her team members cautioned that the study cannot prove that increased weight causes early onset colon cancer, only that the two are associated. It is possible that weight is just a marker for other risk factors, such as diabetes or metabolic issues like high blood pressure or higher cholesterol, which have also been on the rise.</p><p>And the researchers stress that despite the rise in colon cancer among people under 50, it remains relatively rare, at about 8 cases per 100,000 people. Still, because screening for colon cancer usually starts at 50, those who develop it younger are often diagnosed when the disease is in its late stages and more difficult to treat. </p><p>That's why the American Cancer Society recently lowered its recommended age at which most people should have a first screening colonoscopy. The new guidelines advise that screening begins at 45, not 50 as in the previous guidelines. </p><p>Colon cancer expert Dr. Sherif Andrawes directs endoscopy at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City. He said the study \"is very important and confirms a recent observation among clinicians and experts in the field.\"</p><p>And Andrawes said there's another reason to urge Americans to get screened for colon cancer earlier.</p><p>\"A bigger concern is those younger patients with cancer present symptomatic at diagnosis -- which may reflect aggressive disease and an advanced stage at onset of discovery, which leads to overall worse outcomes in a younger individual,\" he said.</p><p>And what about the risk for young obese men? According to Cao's team, one limitation of the study is that it included mostly white women, so more research is needed to see if these associations hold for men and other populations.</p><p>The report was published online Oct. 11 in the journal <i>JAMA Oncology</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more information on obesity and cancer, visit the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/diet-physical-activity/body-weight-and-cancer-risk/effects.html\" target=\"_new\"> American Cancer Society</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p> WEDNESDAY, Dec. 5, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Nobody knows who first said, \"To succeed, you first have to fail.\" But it's a phrase many smokers likely relate to.</p> <p> About half of all smokers try to quit each year, according to federal data. But only about 7 percent are successful.</p> <p>\"We've heard about people who say, 'That's it!' and they stop for good. But that's pretty rare,\" said tobacco researcher John Dani. \"The average person makes multiple attempts before they quit.\"</p> <p> It is the nicotine in cigarettes that keeps people physically addicted. But there are multiple social and psychological factors that also play a role in determining why some smokers who decide to quit are successful while others aren't.</p> <p> For women, weight gain is a common reason for relapse, said Dani, chair of the department of neuroscience at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.</p> <p> He advises women and men to substitute exercise for food when battling the cravings and nervous energy that often accompany nicotine withdrawal.</p> <p>\"Healthy habits like running or walking or doing yoga are great alternatives,\" Dani said. \"I know people who started walking the steps of their building at work instead of walking out to the parking lot to smoke a cigarette.\"</p> <p> Thomas Payne, director of ACT Center for Tobacco Treatment, Education and Research at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, said moments of extreme tension and strain often play a powerful role in why people return to smoking. </p> <p>\"Stress undermines our coping efforts and is often associated with more intense cravings,\" he said.</p> <p> Getting enough sleep each night is essential in reducing stress and increasing a person's chance of quitting for good, he said. Trying to reduce stress with a glass of wine or beer, on the other hand, could make the problem worse.</p> <p>\"Even small amounts of alcohol are associated with an increased risk of relapsing because it causes our inhibitions to drop off a little bit,\" said Payne, who's also an investigator with the American Heart Association Tobacco Regulation and Addiction Center.</p> <p> Studies show smokers have somewhat higher quitting success rates if they use interventions such as counseling; quit lines; nicotine replacement products such as gum, patches and lozenges; and prescription medications.</p> <p>\"Professional help can make all the difference in the world, and many insurance plans cover all or most of the costs involved,\" Payne said.</p> <p> The key, he said, is for people to keep using these programs and products even after they've stopped using tobacco.</p> <p>\"Think of it like antibiotics: You need to keep taking it even if you feel great,\" Payne said. \"A minimum of three months of usage is really what we're shooting for, and for many people, as long as six months may be the sweet spot.\"</p> <p> People who want to stay quit also shouldn't fall prey to the \"one won't hurt\" myth, Dani said.</p> <p>\"Just one often turns into one every couple of weeks, and then once a week, and pretty soon, they're smokers again,\" he said. \"It's similar to how people start smoking in the first place.\"</p> <p> Those who want to quit should also realize that setbacks are manageable.</p> <p>\"People can recover from a slip if they have a good mindset about it,\" Payne said. \"The important thing is not to beat yourself up about it. Think about it as a learning opportunity. Recognize what happened that made you want a cigarette so badly and plan for how you'll react in similar situations down the road.\"</p> <p> Every day, week and month a person goes without smoking, the better their chances of kicking nicotine addiction forever, experts say.</p> <p>\"There is never no risk of relapsing,\" Payne said. \"But the greatest risk period is the first two weeks after quitting. And once a person gets past the first three months or so, relapse risk drops considerably.\"</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Jan. 7, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Older adults who find meaning in their daily activities may remain in better health as they age, a new study suggests.</p><p>Researchers found that when middle-aged and older adults felt their days held meaningful activities, they tended to report better health and well-being four years later.</p><p>Not only were they less likely to develop physical health conditions or chronic pain than other folks, they were also more physically active and less likely to be depressed.</p><p>The results do not prove that cultivating meaningful activities will make a person healthier, said lead researcher Andrew Steptoe, a professor at University College London, in England.</p><p>\"But,\" he said, \"we think there is a two-way relationship between our experiences and life seeming worthwhile. People who are socially engaged and healthy may rate their activities as more meaningful, while at the same time this sense of meaning may contribute to more engagement, better mental health, less loneliness and so on.\"</p><p>The bottom line, added Steptoe, is that \"it seems sensible to think about how to add worthwhile activities to our lives.\"</p><p>And what, exactly, is the definition of \"worthwhile\"? That's in the eye of the beholder, he said.</p><p>The participants in his study were simply asked to rate, on a scale of 1 to 10, the extent to which they felt their daily activities were worthwhile.</p><p>\"The things that bring meaning to people's lives are hugely variable,\" Steptoe said. \"It does not have to be a big project. For some people, things like hiking in the countryside, singing in a local choir, or looking after grandchildren will provide a strong sense of living a worthwhile life.\"</p><p>The findings were published online Jan. 7 in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>. They're based on about 7,300 adults, aged 50 to 90, in the United Kingdom.</p><p>The study participants answered surveys on their health and lifestyle, and underwent objective health tests that measured their cholesterol levels, walking speed and hand strength, among other things.</p><p>Overall, the more meaning people saw in their lives, the better their physical and mental health at the outset, and four years later. The odds of developing a new disease, depression, chronic pain or a disability dipped as \"worthwhile\" ratings rose, the researchers found.</p><p>Of course, people who are in good health, or have high incomes or more education, may be more likely to see their daily activities as worthwhile. But Steptoe said his team factored in those other key variables -- and there was still a connection between viewing life as meaningful and having better health four years later.</p><p>Plus, he noted, people with high ratings on the \"worthwhile\" scale were more likely to make positive lifestyle changes over those four years -- such as starting an exercise routine or eating more fruits and vegetables.</p><p>James Maddux is a senior scholar with the Center for the Advancement of Well-Being, at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va.</p><p> Maddux said he was not surprised by the findings, since they support connections seen in other studies: The more meaning people see in their lives, the healthier they tend to be.</p><p>Why would that be? Personality enters the picture here, he believes.</p><p>People who \"naturally see the good, even in little day-to-day things,\" are likely to take steps that support their physical and mental well-being -- from exercise to eating well to spending quality time with family and friends, Maddux said.</p><p>But even though personality has a large genetic component, that doesn't mean people with a less-sunny disposition are doomed. If you are grumping on the couch, \"the first step is to get off the couch,\" he said.</p><p>Think about what things in life are truly important to you, Maddux suggested -- whether it's family, friends, a creative activity, volunteering or getting involved in a political issue. And then choose those things over Netflix marathons.</p><p>\"Try to spend time, every day, doing something that reflects who you are,\" Maddux said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The University of California Berkeley Greater Good Science Center has advice on <a href=\"https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/key\" target=\"_new\">building well-being</a>.</p>",

Emotional and mental symptoms may become more noticeable several weeks later when children return to school and sports. </p><p>Although symptoms often disappear within a month, some children have prolonged difficulties that likely affect their school functioning, she explained. </p> <p>\"Children with symptoms that persist beyond a month should be monitored by their pediatrician so that they can be referred for any needed physical or psychological health services,\" Ewing-Cobbs added. </p><p>For the study, the researchers looked at nearly 350 children, aged 4 to 15, who suffered either a concussion or an orthopedic injury. Parents completed surveys that asked about their kids before the injury and general information about their home life.</p><p>The researchers then used a ratings scale to evaluate post-concussion recovery. </p><p>Although girls and boys had similar pre-concussion characteristics, girls had significantly more persistent symptoms than boys. They also had twice the odds of symptoms lasting one year after injury, the findings showed.</p><p>Family dynamics were also an important factor in children's recovery, the study authors noted. </p><p>\"Children from families that are supportive, communicative, and have access to a community network of supports tend to do better in a variety of areas, including recovering from a concussion, than children who do not have these assets,\" Ewing-Cobbs said.</p><p>How soon a child can return to school and sports after a concussion needs to be tailored to each child, Ewing-Cobbs suggested. \"There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of return-to-play in high-impact sports,\" she said.  </p><p>That decision should be based on collaboration between medical and school personnel and family, she added. </p><p>Each year, 1 million to 2 million children in the United States are treated for mild traumatic brain injury, which includes concussion from sports and other causes. </p><p> Glatter said this study suggests special accommodations may be needed when kids return to school in order to ensure that recovery continues. </p><p>\"This may include medications to manage headaches, regulate mood and anxiety, as well as cognitive behavioral therapy to help with adjustment and problem solving,\" he said. </p><p>Parents and teachers need to look out for any signs of depression or anxiety that could influence school performance and social integration, Glatter advised. </p><p>\"Trainers, coaches, school administrators and parents need to be invested and aware of the gender-associated medical, family and social issues that play a role in post-concussion recovery,\" he said.</p><p>The report was published online Oct. 15 in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>To learn more about concussion, visit the <a href=\"https://www.aans.org/Patients/Neurosurgical-Conditions-and-Treatments/Concussion\" target=\"_new\"> American Association of Neurological Surgeons</a>.</p>",

In fact, there was a decline in the percentage who said they'd ever had sex: from almost 21 percent in 2008, to about 18 percent in 2013.</p><p>And when girls did have sex, they were more likely to use condoms and birth control in more recent years, the findings showed.</p><p>The findings align with smaller studies from the United States and Europe, said Ogilvie, a professor at the University of British Columbia's School of Population and Public Health.</p><p>\"This study gives us more evidence HPV vaccination is not causing kids to make poorer choices in their sexual behavior,\" she said.</p><p>Dr. Ina Park, an advisor to the American Sexual Health Association, agreed. She said she hopes the findings reassure parents who have lingering worries.</p><p>\"Any fears that HPV vaccination would lead to increased sexual risk-taking should finally be put to rest,\" said Park, who is also an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine.</p><p>\"We should continue to encourage HPV vaccination for all preteen girls and boys,\" she said.</p><p>The findings are based on nearly 300,000 girls who took part in a periodic health survey of British Columbia teenagers. The girls were 15 years old, on average. </p><p>Of girls surveyed in 2003, 21 percent said they'd ever had sex. That figure was similar in 2008, the year the HPV vaccine program began. But by 2013, only about 18 percent of girls said they'd ever had sex. </p><p>There were also signs that more girls were delaying sex in recent years. Among those who were sexually active, the percentage who'd had sex before age 14 dipped by one-quarter.</p><p>Meanwhile, more girls in 2013 said they'd used condoms or birth control pills.</p><p>\"Their sexual health choices actually got better,\" Ogilvie said. She noted that there could be various reasons for that, and no one is saying the HPV vaccine program deserves the credit.</p><p>Some parents, Ogilvie said, might wonder why their 11-year-old needs a vaccine against a sexually transmitted disease.</p><p>\"But that's exactly when we want to get them -- before they start having sex and are exposed to HPV,\" Ogilvie said. \"This is about prevention.\"</p><p>And ultimately, she added, it's about preventing cancer.</p><p>\"This is really a vaccine against cancer,\" Ogilvie said. \"And it's exciting that we have a cancer vaccine.\"</p><p>The study was published Oct. 15 in <i>CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal)</i>. It was funded by the Canadian government.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-vaccine-fact-sheet\" target=\"_new\">HPV vaccination</a>.</p>",

It's also known that the number of babies suffering from neonatal abstinence syndrome -- because of opioid use during pregnancy -- has increased dramatically in recent years, she added.</p><p>\"Our research points to yet another spill-over effect of these broader trends of the opioid crisis,\" added Gemmill, an assistant professor of family, population and preventive medicine.</p><p>The analysis looked at the U.S. National Vital Statistics System's death certificate data for women aged 15 to 49. The researchers focused on deaths across 22 states and Washington, D.C., that occurred during pregnancy and up to one year post-pregnancy.</p><p>The study team found that even though white women are less likely to die from any cause while pregnant, they are more likely than blacks or Hispanics to die because of opioids.</p><p>\"We think this is because what we're seeing mirrors broader race-specific trends of the epidemic,\" said Gemmill.</p><p>She pointed to research conducted by her co-authors that found that between the mid-1990s and 2010, \"the opioid epidemic expanded quickly within the white population, while opioid mortality remained stable in the black population.\"</p><p>The vast majority of opioid-related deaths in the study group (70 percent) occurred either during pregnancy or within 42 days after terminating a pregnancy, according to the new report.</p><p>Also, the underlying class of drugs implicated in a pregnant woman's death shifted over the decade, with fewer fatalities involving methadone.</p><p>By 2016, nearly 80 percent of these deaths involved either heroin or a synthetic opioid such as fentanyl. This figure was less than 20 percent in 2007, the study authors said.</p><p>Exactly how these women died -- whether it was due to overdosing, for instance -- remained outside the scope of the study.</p><p>But because pregnancy typically entails frequent contact between a woman and her health care providers, Gemmill suggested that clinicians have a great opportunity to intervene in the face of drug abuse.</p><p>She also noted that a substantial proportion of women die from opioid use more than six weeks after giving birth. This \"underlines the need for specialized strategies that address the complex needs women face after giving birth,\" she said.</p><p>\"This is a difficult task,\" Gemmill acknowledged, \"given that many women do not even attend their recommended postpartum checkup.\"</p><p>Dr. Maria Small is an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C.</p><p>\"The problem needs a policy-based and medical-based solution,\" said Small.</p><p>Any response to the growing risk will need to go beyond simply addressing each woman's immediate medical and emergency needs, she suggested. It will also require clinicians \"with knowledge of how to treat opioid and other substance toxicities,\" Small said.</p><p>Also needed are treatment programs that enlist loved ones and the community at large, Small added.</p><p>The findings were published online recently in the <i>American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on pregnancy and opioid use at the <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/women-drugs/pregnant-concerned-about-opioid-use#videos/\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Oct. 19, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The latest national tally on dieting finds that nearly half of U.S. adults are doing what they can to trim a widening waistline.</p><p>Overall, 49.3 percent of people aged 20 and older said they'd tried to lose weight over the past 12 months, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The findings were based on a 2015-2016 national health survey, the latest data available.</p><p>The new stats reflect a significant increase from prior surveys. For example, 43 percent of American adults were trying to slim down in 2007-2008, but the numbers have crept steadily upwards every year since, the CDC said.</p><p>Attempts at weight loss were higher for women than men in the latest survey (56.3 percent and 42.2 percent, respectively), but over time rates of increase have been steady for both genders.</p><p>Why are more Americans than ever concerned about overweight and obesity? Registered dietitian Stephanie Schiff cites multiple reasons.</p><p>First off, \"we are more sedentary than ever before,\" said Schiff, who guides the nutrition program at Northwell Health's Huntington Hospital, in Huntington, N.Y. \"Our entertainment is more likely to occur while we are sitting -- in front of the TV, in front of a computer, in bed with our phones in our hands.\"</p><p>Next, \"we're not cooking our own food as much, we're eating out more,\" she said. \"And when we don't have a hand in our own meals, we don't have control over what goes into it -- others do. And they add more fat, more sugar, more salt.\"</p><p>Increasing stress levels can also \"play havoc with our metabolisms,\" Schiff said, and that can prompt people to overeat. Sleeplessness is another known risk factor for poor eating, she added.</p><p>So what works to get slim and keep the weight from coming back?  Sharon Zarabi is a registered dietitian who leads the bariatric program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p>  <p>She believes the key is to incorporate healthy living habits that last a lifetime -- not just a fast fix.</p><p>\"I try to avoid using the word 'diet,' as it is something you manage for a short period of time based on food intake,\" she said. Instead, Zarabi said, she would \"encourage more healthy living, which focuses on incorporating rituals to define a new sense of optimal well-being to feel good for life.\"</p><p>\"You follow a diet when you want to lose weight -- and then what?,\" she said. \"Lifestyle is what keeps the weight off, and that comes through our behavior.\"</p><p>Schiff agreed. She noted that even the faddiest, \"odd\" diets can work to drop pounds, but then those pounds come creeping back.</p><p>\"Because eating only 500 calories a day may not be sustainable, or eating only certain foods for your blood type,\" she explained.</p><p>The real solution is finding \"a way of eating that is natural and has you feeling satisfied\" over the long term, Schiff said. That means including foods you actually enjoy.</p><p>Sticking to plant-based foods and avoiding refined sugars, refined flour and chemically processed foods works best, Schiff said.</p><p>\"Sometimes it also means changing your environment -- getting rid of problem foods in your house, the foods you have no control over, or that you eat just because they're there,\" she said.</p><p>The bottom line, she said, is to \"make changes that you know you can live with for the rest of your life.\"</p><p>And don't forget exercise. Exercise can help boost weight loss, but more importantly it's a way of \"keeping your body finely tuned and healthy and strong,\" Schiff said.  And with exercise -- especially resistance exercise -- if weight does come back, it will return as healthy muscle, not fat, she said.</p><p>The new stats on weight loss were published Oct. 18 in the CDC journal <i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There;'s more on maintaining a healthy weight at the <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute</a>.</p>",

She is a surgical resident and research fellow at Michigan Medicine.</p><p>\"This is not a phenomenon of a few outlier surgeons -- it was seen across the state, and across many operations,\" Vu noted in a university news release.</p><p>In the study, the researchers analyzed data from nearly 2,400 patients who had one of 12 common types of surgery at 33 hospitals in Michigan. On average, patients took only 27 percent of the opioids (such as OxyContin) prescribed to them. However,  for every 10 additional pills prescribed, patients took five of them.</p><p>The median number of pills prescribed was 30 and the median number used was nine, the researchers found.</p><p>Patients who had a hernia repair operation -- either open or minimally invasive surgery -- took the most opioids, while those who had their appendix or thyroid taken out took the least, the findings showed.</p><p>But the size of the opioid prescription was a more important factor in how many pills a patient took than their pain scores, the intensity of their operation and personal factors, the study authors said.</p><p>According to study first author Dr. Ryan Howard, \"In what we tell patients about what kind of pain to expect after surgery, and how many pills we give, we set their expectations -- and what the patient expects plays a huge role in their post-operative pain experience. So if they get 60 pain pills, they think they have to take many of them.\" </p><p>Howard, a surgical resident with Michigan Medicine, added, \"We hope that by shining a spotlight on the difference between prescription size and actual use, we can empower surgeons to change their prescribing habits, and be a better steward to both their patient and the broader community.\" </p><p>The report was published Nov. 7 in the journal <i>JAMA Surgery</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse has more about <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/prescription-opioids\" target=\"_new\">prescription opioids</a>.</p>",

Beta amyloid plaques and tangles of tau proteins are two of the hallmarks found in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.</p><p>But the effect that herpes may have on the brain is not yet fully understood, and it's unlikely that the virus alone can explain all cases of Alzheimer's, said James Hendrix, director of global science initiatives for the Alzheimer's Association.</p><p>Hendrix noted that half of all adults carry the herpes simplex 1 virus.</p><p>\"We know that 50 percent of the population isn't getting Alzheimer's disease, so it's not a 1-to-1 correlation,\" Hendrix said. \"If we took the recommendation of the author of this paper and gave everybody over the age of 55 antiviral drugs, I don't think we would wipe out Alzheimer's disease. We might lower it somewhat, but I don't think we would eliminate Alzheimer's disease.\"</p><p>Herpes simplex virus 1 infects most humans in infancy, and remains dormant within the peripheral nervous system from then on, Itzhaki said. Stress can cause the virus to reactivate and, in some people, cause cold sores.</p><p>Itzhaki and her colleagues believe that herpes contributes to Alzheimer's disease by migrating into the brains of elderly people as their immune system naturally declines.</p><p>Once it has infected the brain, Itzhaki argues, HSV1 causes damage and inflammation in brain cells whenever it's reactivated by events such as stress, immune suppression or infection by other microbes.</p><p>This damage is particularly bad in people with the APOE4 gene, which has been directly linked to Alzheimer's disease, she said.</p><p>\"The likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease is 12 times greater for APOE4 carriers who have HSV1 [the herpes virus] in the brain than for those with neither factor,\" Itzhaki said.</p><p>\"We suggest that repeated activation causes cumulative damage, leading eventually to Alzheimer's disease in people with an APOE4 allele,\" Itzhaki continued. \"Presumably, in APOE4 carriers, Alzheimer's disease develops in the brain because of greater HSV1-induced formation of toxic products, or lesser repair of damage.\"</p><p>Dr. Sam Gandy is associate director of the Mount Sinai Alzheimer's Disease Research Center in New York City. He said there's evidence that viruses can have an effect on other diseases of the brain and nervous system, in particular Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).</p><p>\"Probably the best evidence that viruses can contribute to major brain illnesses comes from ALS, where they found not a herpes virus but a retrovirus,\" Gandy said. \"The peptides of the virus appeared in the spinal fluid of patients with ALS, and when they treated those patients with antiretrovirals, they seemed to clinically stabilize.\"</p><p>Itzhaki said a newer study out of Taiwan seems to indicate that ridding the body of herpes through antiviral drugs could reduce Alzheimer's risk.</p><p>The Taiwan results showed that the risk of dementia was much greater in people infected with herpes, and that treatment with antivirals caused a dramatic decrease in the number of people severely infected by HSV1 who went on to later develop dementia, Itzhaki said.</p><p>However, Hendrix said, the Taiwanese results can be explained in other ways. For example, it might not be the antiviral drugs that reduced the rates of dementia, but the fact that those specific patients were receiving better medical treatment overall.</p><p>\"We know that better quality health care leads to lower rates of dementia,\" Hendrix said.</p><p>Gandy said that, while the link between herpes and Alzheimer's is promising, clinical trials would be needed to show that antiviral treatment can effectively head off dementia in people.</p><p>\"There's lots of circumstantial evidence. The definitive proof requires finding living people who have the virus and symptoms of dementia, giving them the antiviral, and showing that their symptoms stabilize or improve,\" Gandy said.</p><p>New research tools will be needed, including a brain scan that can specifically detect herpes in the brain, he added.</p><p>\"We have to be able to find the virus as a warning flag, to tell us to initiate the treatment, and then see whether that has an impact on the progression,\" Gandy said.</p><p>The new paper was published online Oct. 19 in the journal <i>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The World Health Organization has more about <a href=\" http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/herpes-simplex-virus#hsv1 \" target=\"_new\">herpes simplex virus 1</a>.</p>",

In a study of 12 dogs, the investigators say they've dug up some new details about how pooches process words.</p><p>\"Many dog owners think that their dogs know what some words mean, but there really isn't much scientific evidence to support that,\" said study first author Ashley Prichard, a Ph.D. candidate in psychology. \"We wanted to get data from the dogs themselves -- not just owner reports.\"</p><p>The study included various breeds. The dogs were trained for months by their owners to retrieve two different objects when told the objects' names -- \"Monkey\" and \"Piggy.\" One was a soft toy, the other a hard one.</p><p>The dogs underwent brain scans while their owners first presented the toys and said the toys' names. The owners then held up new objects and said nonsense words.</p><p>The dogs showed greater activation in the sound-processing (auditory) regions of the brain in response to the new nonsense words than to the words they were trained to recognize, the researchers found.</p><p>\"We expected to see that dogs neurally discriminate between words that they know and words that they don't,\" Prichard said in a university news release.</p><p>\"What's surprising is that the result is opposite to that of research on humans -- people typically show greater neural activation for known words than novel words,\" she noted. </p><p>The dogs may show greater brain activity in response to a new word because they sense their owners want them to understand what they are saying, and they are trying to do so, the researchers suggested.</p><p>\"Dogs ultimately want to please their owners, and perhaps also receive praise or food,\" said study senior author and neuroscientist Gregory Berns. </p><p>The findings suggest that dogs have at least a basic ability to recognize words they've been taught, and to distinguish between words they've heard before and those they haven't, according to the researchers.</p><p>\"We know that dogs have the capacity to process at least some aspects of human language since they can learn to follow verbal commands,\" Berns said. \"Previous research, however, suggests dogs may rely on many other cues to follow a verbal command, such as gaze, gestures and even emotional expressions from their owners.\"</p><p>The study was published Oct. 15 in the journal <i>Frontiers of Neuroscience</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The National Canine Research Organization has more on the <a href=\"https://www.nationalcanineresearchcouncil.com/news/are-you-happy-disgusted-your-dog-can-tell-difference\" target=\"_new\">human-dog connection</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Oct. 23, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration \"jumped the gun\" when it declared the chemical BPA safe for consumers earlier this year, experts from the Endocrine Society claimed Tuesday.</p><p>The FDA asserted in February that its \"initial review supports our determination that currently authorized uses of BPA continue to be safe for consumers.\"</p><p>But the FDA made that statement without reviewing pending evidence from ongoing studies being conducted outside the agency, said Heather Patisaul, a professor with North Carolina State University's department of biological sciences.</p><p>Further, the agency even shrugged off its own data showing that low levels of BPA could increase risk of breast and prostate cancer, said Laura Vandenberg, an associate professor with the University of Massachusetts Amherst School of Public Health and Health Sciences.</p><p>\"There are serious effects that were observed in the FDA core study, even in the groups that were exposed only to low doses of BPA,\" Vandenberg said. \"Unfortunately, these effects seem to be dismissed by the FDA, often because they aren't observed at high doses.\"</p><p>The FDA did not respond to a request from <i>HealthDay</i> for comment.</p><p>The FDA study had been designed as a groundbreaking collaboration between federal regulators and academic scientists.</p><p>In the study, researchers force-fed BPA to lab rats at varying doses and for varied amounts of time, out to two years.</p><p>The effort was aimed at clearing up safety concerns regarding BPA, a chemical used to make plastic containers and the lining of food cans. BPA mimics the hormone estrogen in the body, and has been linked to reproductive, behavior and metabolic disorders, Vandenberg said.</p><p>But the final report, which integrates the FDA data with results from academic studies, won't be released until fall of 2019, said Patisaul. She is one of the academic researchers involved in the final report. Some of the academic studies are still undergoing peer review.</p><p>Despite this, the FDA issued a statement months ago based solely on its own data, which it referred to as \"an important step for this consortium.\"</p><p>But, Patisaul explained, \"Now we're in the very critical phase where we have to take all of that information, put all of that data together, and come up with a conclusion for how BPA impacts our bodies. That will involve not only the FDA's core study data, but all of the data from the independent investigators.\"</p><p>So, she added, \"that's why there has been concern from the Endocrine Study and others that FDA is jumping the gun a little bit in its conclusion that BPA in food packaging is safe, because the data has not yet been integrated.\"</p><p>The FDA statement did note that the integrated report would be released in the future, but Patisaul said that by issuing the statement, the agency had essentially established a firm position in favor of BPA's safety.</p><p>\"The FDA has put a stake in the ground. They have said BPA is safe. And they are very reluctant to back away from that stake, because doing so requires them to admit, essentially capitulate, that they got it wrong the first time,\" Patisaul said.</p><p>However, even within the FDA's own data there's reason to doubt BPA's safety, Vandenberg said.</p><p>The FDA data shows that at low doses, BPA increased the incidence of breast cancer, prostate inflammation and kidney disease in lab rats, she explained.</p><p>For example, more than 20 percent of rats exposed to a low dose of BPA developed breast cancer, and about 45 percent had increased prostate inflammation at a similarly low dose, according to Vandenberg.</p><p>The FDA might have disregarded these findings because there wasn't a clear dose-response relationship, in that the health risk from BPA failed to increase with the level of the dose, she noted.</p><p>But substances that affect the hormone system often only show effects at low doses (where the body mistakes the substance for an actual hormone) and high doses (where levels become toxic), she said.</p><p>\"The reality is not a linear relationship between dose and effect, but a U-shaped relationship,\" Vandenberg explained.</p><p> Patisaul said that consumers worried about BPA safety can protect themselves by using less plastic, instead storing food in glass containers. They also can avoid handling thermal paper receipts or microwaving food in plastic containers.</p><p>\"If you're really worried you can avoid canned foods, particularly things like tomatoes that are acidic and react with the lining,\" Patisaul suggested.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Mayo Clinic has more about <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/bpa/faq-20058331\" target=\"_new\">BPA</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Oct. 25, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- You can get your hands on pumpkin seeds on about any store's snack aisle, but your healthiest option may be the old-fashioned way: scooping them out of the stringy guts of that jack-o'-lantern you're carving.</p> <p>That's because store-bought pumpkin seeds -- ever more popular because they're easy to eat and loaded with nutrients -- may be loaded with salt as well. But when they come straight from the source, pumpkin seeds are lower in sodium and have more of the minerals that make them so nutritious, said Judith Wylie-Rosett, a professor and division head for health promotion and nutrition research at New York's Albert Einstein College of Medicine. </p> <p>Of course, buying whole pumpkins for the seeds isn't exactly economical or practical. But you can and should find the unsalted variety, Wylie-Rosett said. </p> <p>\"We think of savory foods as having that salty flavor,\" she said. \"We're very acculturated to that. If we eat less salt, then we crave less salt, but that takes a lot of work for some people.\"</p> <p>Pumpkin seeds, also known as pepitas, can be consumed with or without their shells. Once you've scooped them out of the pumpkin, it's advisable to soak them in water for a few hours to help remove the pulp from the shells. (There's nothing wrong with consuming the fleshy bits that are attached to the shells, but many don't care for the texture.) A common practice is to add light spices and roast the seeds on a cookie sheet on the top rack of the oven for 15 to 20 minutes at 350 degrees.</p> <p>Eating the shells only adds to the seeds' high fiber content, which has been associated with a reduced risk of heart disease and obesity. Whole, roasted pumpkin seeds in their shells contain about 5.2 grams of fiber per serving, while shelled seeds contain just 1.8 grams.</p> <p>\"There is one caveat to the fiber, though,\" Wylie-Rosett said. \"If somebody has not been eating very much fiber at all, and they then eat a large quantity of pumpkin seeds  they may end up with some digestive-tract disturbance.\"</p> <p>Pumpkin seeds also are rich in other nutrients, including magnesium, which can aid in heart and bone health, lower blood pressure and even prevent migraines. Just a quarter cup of pumpkin seeds includes 42 percent of a person's recommended daily intake of magnesium, a potentially easy solution for almost half of Americans who don't get enough magnesium in their diets.</p> <p>\"As a mineral, magnesium actually helps with a lot of the somatic (bodily) functions of the body,\" Wylie-Rosett said. \"Historically we ate a lot more magnesium, but as we have processed food, it is processed out and may not be replaced that much.\" </p> <p>Other benefits of pumpkin seeds include:</p> <ul> <li> A serving of seeds contains about 6.6 mg of zinc, which accounts for almost half the recommended daily intake. Zinc is important in the diet because it's an antioxidant and an anti-inflammatory agent that also helps the metabolic process. </li> <li>They're a natural source of tryptophan, which can help promote sleep.</li> <li> They have been linked to a reduced risk of some types of cancer, including breast and prostate cancers.</li> <li> Studies have shown that pumpkin seed oil may reduce cholesterol and high blood pressure. </li> <li> Studies also have shown that seeds can reduce blood sugar, which is important for people who have diabetes.</li> </ul> <p>One cautionary note: Pumpkin-spiced everything during the autumn months is not necessarily recommended.</p> <p>Pumpkin spice itself contains just a couple of calories per serving, but it often shows up with foods and drinks that are not so healthy. </p> <p>\"People come up with methods of overdoing it that I never could think of,\" Wylie-Rosett said. \"So often we don't eat pumpkin as a vegetable. We eat it as an ingredient in a dessert. We treat it as a seasonal item.\"</p> <p>Two healthy options for eating pumpkin no matter the season are pumpkin stew and roasted pumpkin, she said. Recipes for those dishes offer a way to consume the flesh of the pumpkin, which is high in carotenoids and fiber and low in fat. </p>",

He's an assistant professor of medicine at Pitt's Center for Research on Media, Technology and Health.</p><p>\"This is highly concerning because adolescents exposed to e-cigarette marketing are more likely to use e-cigarettes and, in turn, young adults who use e-cigarettes are four times as likely as their non-vaping peers to transition to smoking traditional tobacco cigarettes,\" Chu explained in a university news release.</p><p>But Ted Kwong, a Juul spokesman, said the company works hard to aim its messages at adults.</p><p>\"We have taken numerous actions to prevent and combat underage use, including focusing our website and social media exclusively on the adult smoker community and removing all product-related content from our social media accounts,\" he said.</p><p>\"Since 99.7 percent of JuuL mentions on Twitter are generated by other users, we have also aggressively worked with social media platforms to remove posts and accounts that portray our product in unauthorized and youth-oriented manners,\" Kwong added.</p><p>It's believed that teens are more susceptible to nicotine addiction than adults. Nine out of every 10 cigarette smokers started before age 18, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Juul e-cigarettes resemble a flash drive and can be plugged into a computer to recharge. Juul vapor contains about double the concentration of nicotine found in other e-cigarettes and comes in flavors appealing to youngsters, such as mango and fruit medley, the researchers said.</p><p>The study looked at 3,239 tweets from Juul's official Twitter account between February 2017 and January 2018. The tweets were retweeted 1,124 times by 721 Twitter users.</p><p>The users' profiles were examined to determine if they were younger than 18. If the user didn't reveal an age, certain clues were used to find out if that person was a minor, such as a mention of their grade in school or an age-specific event.</p><p>If there was any doubt, the user was classified as an adult.</p><p>Along with concluding that at least 25 percent of Juul's Twitter followers are minors, the researchers also found that some of the Juul tweets were retweeted in a chain that extended through four Twitter users.</p><p>When someone retweets, the original tweet is shared with all of that person's followers, even if none of them follows the source of the original tweet, the researchers explained.</p><p>\"When this happens, the people seeing the retweet are getting it from a person, not a brand. It adds a level of normalization and buffers the viewers from the impersonal element of advertising, particularly if the person who retweeted it is a trusted friend or someone they aspire to be like,\" Chu said.</p><p>The same type of analyses used in this study could be used by public health agencies to identify teen Twitter networks promoting e-cigarette use and target them with counter-messaging, Chu suggested.</p><p>But Kwong reiterated that Juul products are only for use by adults.</p><p>\"We cannot be more emphatic on this point: no minor or nonsmoker/vaper should ever use Juul products,\" he said. \"Underage use is directly opposed to our mission of eliminating combustible cigarettes by offering the world's one billion existing adult smokers a true alternative.\"</p><p>The study was published Oct. 19 in the <i>Journal of Adolescent Health</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse has more about <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/electronic-cigarettes-e-cigarettes\" target=\"_new\">e-cigarettes</a>.</p>",

Note that you'll also see the term telemedicine, which usually refers to virtual visits with a doctor. Telehealth is broader and includes care from other types of health professionals, such as nurses.</p> <p>During \"visits\" you video chat with a health-care professional through your smartphone, tablet or computer, sometimes with no waiting time. And it all happens in real time.</p><p>Telehealth services vary from getting a diagnosis and a prescription, if needed, for minor medical issues, to ongoing monitoring of chronic conditions -- especially helpful to older Americans. As an example, your heart rate or blood sugar levels can be sent remotely to your doctor's office and he or she can review them with you while you have your virtual visit.</p><p>One study found that the most common virtual visits were for acute respiratory problems, urinary tract infections and skin complaints. In fact, telehealth can be very helpful in dermatology, a specialty that's short on doctors.</p><p>Telehealth for mental health care is another growing area. Video sessions can help people stick with their treatment plan if getting to a therapist's office is difficult. And it can be just as effective as face-to-face appointments.</p><p>Some health insurance providers now offer telehealth as an option in some of their plans. There's usually a fee for a telehealth visit, but it can be lower than your in-office co-pay. If you're on a high-deductible plan, the cost will certainly be less than you'd pay out-of-pocket for an office visit.</p><p>The Veterans Administration is just one of many government agencies that offers a variety of telehealth services.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The National Conference of State Legislatures has state-by-state information on <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-coverage-for-telehealth-services.aspx\" target=\"_new\">telehealth</a> services in your area.</p>",

Meanwhile, 92 percent agree that doctors and other health care professionals should only prescribe antibiotics when necessary.</p><p>The survey also found that: 37 percent of respondents mistakenly believe that antibiotics can treat viral infections; only 57 percent knew that even a single course of antibiotics taken when not appropriate can contribute to antibiotic resistance; and only 61 percent knew that antibiotic-resistant bacteria can spread from person to person.</p><p>Also, 29 percent of respondents said they would be unhappy if their doctor did not prescribe antibiotics for their child's viral infection.</p><p>Dr. Cynthia Sears is president of IDSA. \"Antibiotic resistance is threatening our ability to safely and effectively provide medical care to many patients, including organ and bone marrow transplants, joint replacements and other complex surgeries, cancer chemotherapy, and care of preterm infants,\" she said. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/about.html\" target=\"_new\">antibiotic resistance</a>.</p>",

Thirteen of those cases were severe enough to require hospitalization and one patient developed kidney failure, although no deaths have so far been reported.</p><p>The latest case of reported illness onset occurred Oct. 31. States affected by the outbreak include California (10 cases), Connecticut (1 case), Illinois (2 cases), Massachusetts (2 cases), Maryland (1 case), Michigan (7 cases), New Hampshire (2 cases), New Jersey (3 cases), New York (2 cases), Ohio (1 case) and Wisconsin (1 case).</p><p>The FDA noted that romaine lettuce typically has a shelf life of about 21 days, so contaminated produce could still be on store shelves or in people's refrigerators. For that reason, \"consumers throughout the U.S. shouldnot eatromaine lettuce until further notice,\" the agency advised.</p><p>The exact source of the outbreak remains unclear, but tests are being done on romaine lettuce throughout the U.S. market.</p><p>The strain of E. coli O157:H7 that's causing illness in the current outbreak \"is different than the one identified in the large outbreak in Spring 2018 linked to romaine from the Yuma growing region,\" the FDA said. However, \"it does appear to be similar to the strain that caused a smaller outbreak linked to leafy greens that occurred in the fall of 2017 in both the U.S. and Canada,\" the news release stated.</p><p>\"The quick and aggressive steps we're taking today are aimed at making sure we get ahead of this emerging outbreak, to reduce risk to consumers, and to help people protect themselves and their families from this foodborne illness outbreak,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in the press release. \"This is especially important ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, when people will be sitting down for family meals.\"</p><p>He said that, right now, there's just not enough evidence to request a recall from specific lettuce supplier, so in the meantime consumers should just avoid the product altogether.</p><p>If you feel you might be ill with E. coli, seek medical help. Symptoms often include severe stomach cramps, diarrhea (often bloody), and vomiting.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Find out more about E. coli illness at the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/ecoli-symptoms.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

The College of New Jersey exercise science professor Avery Faigenbaum defined the term exercise-deficit disorder -- or EDD -- to draw attention to our children's shortfall when it comes to meeting moderate-to-vigorous physical activity recommendations of at least 60 minutes a day.</p><p>And experts warn that the unhealthy effects of EDD will extend into adulthood, causing problems like high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes, and that it's time to think of exercise as illness prevention.</p><p>The secret to getting kids motivated is the same as it is for adults: Make exercise fun.</p><p>One way to do that is by engaging kids in activity bites, small chunks of play that add up to better health without seeming like a chore. Here are some ideas to get your family started.</p><p>In your backyard or a nearby park, set up relay races or an obstacle course and invite neighborhood families to join.</p><p>For an activity that can be done anywhere, blow up some balloons and make a game of keeping them all up in the air. You can also do this with exercise balls or even beach balls, no matter what the season.</p><p>Take a page from your own childhood playbook and share the fun of hula hoops and tossing a Frisbee. Even an activity like drawing with sidewalk chalk gets kids out of the house and away from their electronic devices.</p><p>Turn <i>scheduling</i> exercise into a fun project by having your kids create an activity calendar and check off each \"bite\" as it's completed. Post the calendar on the fridge along with snapshots of their best chalk artwork, for instance, for motivation.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Council on Exercise has details for creating <a href=\"https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/lifestyle/blog/5053/youth-fitness-activity-calendar\" target=\"_new\">an activity calendar</a> to get and keep kids motivated to exercise.</p>",

Low energy translates to less self-control and a greater chance of aggression.</p><p>The good news: A study published in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i> found that a steady blood glucose level can translate into fewer fights with your spouse.</p><p>People in general have a harder time controlling anger than other emotions. It takes self-control to keep it reined in, but that's not something we have in unlimited amounts.</p><p>In fact, once you start drawing on your daily store of self-control, it quickly becomes depleted. So if you use it to keep from arguing with a co-worker or even to stop yourself from eating a donut in the breakroom, you'll have less of it by the time you get home.</p><p>Complicating the picture is that exerting self-control itself takes energy. So if your blood sugar is down because you haven't eaten in hours or didn't eat enough, self-control becomes even harder to draw on -- you just won't have the energy to cope with or even focus on the situation at hand. That's the reason dieting in particular can make people cranky. We also tend to take out frustrations on those closest to us, like our spouse.</p><p>Understanding why there are times when it's hard <i>not</i> to snap at your partner can help you know when to \"bite your tongue\" and resist engaging in an argument. The answer can be as simple as grabbing a snack or, even better, having a relaxing dinner together to put you in a happy mood for the evening ahead.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>You can read the entire <i>PNAS</i> study on <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/17/6254.full\" target=\"_new\">low blood sugar and bickering</a> online.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Oct. 22, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Childhood obesity has been linked to a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and early heart disease, but new research now ties it to a sometimes crippling hip condition.</p><p>It's called slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), and it causes the hip to become deformed, occasionally so much so that the hip collapses. SCFE causes pain and may result in lifelong disability, British researchers said. </p><p>\"Children with severe obesity at 5 years old had almost 20 times the risk of developing the severe hip deformity than a thin child,\" said study author Dr. Daniel Perry, a senior clinical lecturer in orthopedic surgery at the University of Liverpool.</p><p>The heavier a child was, the greater the risk of the hip condition, Perry said.</p><p>SCFE happens when the epiphysis -- the head of the thighbone -- slips from the bone at the growth plate, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Growth plates are weaker areas of bone that aren't fully developed yet. </p><p>So how does excess weight cause this problem?</p><p>\"The belief is that this is a mechanical failure,\" Perry said. \"Quite simply, the support structures around the growth plate in the hip can't withstand the weight of the child. The growth plate therefore slips out of place -- sometimes this is a sudden process, or sometimes this occurs very gradually.\" </p><p>Dr. Matthew Hepinstall, associate director of the Center for Joint Preservation and Reconstruction at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said SCFE is most common in preteens and young teens.</p><p>\"It seems to happen most often during growth spurts, when growth plates are wider, and therefore weaker. If not diagnosed early and stabilized with surgery, the parts of the thighbone on either side of the growth plate shift,\" he explained.</p><p>Hepinstall added that while this injury may heal, the bone develops with an abnormal shape that may cause hip problems into adulthood. </p><p>He said the problem is more common in heavier children because \"weight places more stress on the growth plate.\" </p><p>Perry said the condition should always be treated surgically to stabilize the hip. If the problem is diagnosed early, surgery is minor. </p><p>If it isn't diagnosed until the hip is severely displaced, \"then the child may have to undergo high-risk surgery to reconstruct the hip. Despite [our] best efforts, the hip bone often dies as the blood supply that feeds the hip gets injured, either by the disease or by the reconstructive surgery,\" he said.</p><p>When the hipbone dies, a hip replacement may be the only alternative. \"This is a huge undertaking in a youngster, with many repeat surgeries expected to be necessary throughout their life,\" Perry explained. </p><p>In the study, the researchers looked at health information on nearly 600,000 Scottish children from two different studies. One study included 5-and 6-year-old children born from 1970 onward. The other study began in 1995.</p><p>All of the children had height and weight measurements taken when they started elementary school and then again when they were 11 to 12 years old. </p><p>Seventy-five percent of the youngsters who were obese at 5 or 6 were still obese when they were 11 or 12, the study found.</p><p>Kids who were severely obese at 5 or 6 had almost six times the risk of SCFE compared to their normal-weight peers. Those who were severely obese at 11 or 12 had 17 times the risk of the hip condition. And the more weight a child put on, the greater the risk of SCFE. </p><p>\"We are very apprehensive that there will be an explosion in this hip disease if childhood obesity continues to rise,\" Perry said. </p><p>He said it's important that parents realize children won't just outgrow obesity. Significant lifestyle changes are needed. </p><p>But given the rise in childhood obesity, Perry also noted that physicians who care for children need to be aware of this condition. </p><p>\"Hip pain -- and knee pain, as the hip and the knee share sensory [feeling] nerves -- in adolescents, and especially obese adolescents, may mean the child has a SCFE,\" Perry said. Children with hip pain need to be examined on an urgent basis, as well as have X-rays to identify the deformity. </p><p>The findings were published online Oct. 22 in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons has more details on <a href=\"https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe\" target=\"_new\"> slipped capital femoral epiphysis</a>.</p>",

He is director of the mood and anxiety disorders program at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in New York City.</p><p>Ezogabine was approved in 2011 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an anti-seizure medication. Shortly after its approval, concerns were raised about the drug's effect on the retina and the possibility of it causing blindness.</p><p>The FDA ordered the drug's maker, GlaxoSmithKline, to do further safety studies. After reviewing those studies, the FDA ruled in 2015 that the drug did not appear to affect vision. Still, the company withdrew ezogabine from the U.S. market in 2017, citing poor sales.</p><p>Even so, psychiatrists noted that if the drug proves effective against depression in larger studies, other drugs that target this area of the brain could be developed.</p><p>Some 15 million Americans suffer from major depressive disorder, which is a leading cause of disability. Treatments include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such a Prozac and Paxil, but they are not effective across the board, the researchers noted.</p><p>It may be that depression is not one disease, but several that affect different areas of the brain, Murrough said.</p><p>That's why new approaches are needed to increase the number of drugs available that target different areas of the brain where depression arises and help patients cope with depression's various forms, he said.</p><p>\"Ongoing research is trying to find new ways to treat depression based on understanding what's going on in the brain when someone gets depressed and how can we reverse that,\" Murrough said.</p><p>Ezogabine works by increasing the activity of the area in the brain that controls potassium. Murrough explained animal studies have shown that depression can reduce the activity of this potassium channel and that ezogabine can increase its activity, thus relieving depression.</p><p>To see if the drug could work in humans, Murrough and his colleagues treated 18 people suffering from major depression with daily doses of ezogabine for 10 weeks.</p><p>MRI scans of the participants found that the drug activated the brain's so-called reward system, which resulted in a significant reduction of depressive symptoms.</p><p>Not all patients responded to the drug, which might mean that their condition has a different cause, Murrough said.</p><p>The researchers said they are currently conducting a larger trial that will compare ezogabine with a placebo, to get a better idea of how effective the drug is at treating depression. </p><p>The report was published online Nov. 1 in the journal <i>Molecular Psychiatry</i>.</p><p> Dr. Victor Fornari is a psychiatrist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He said, \"We need to find newer ways to treat depression,\" and ezogabine might be one of these new approaches.</p><p>\"This study doesn't change treatment -- yet,\" he added. \"At least this is preliminary evidence that this potassium channel target might be another avenue for treatment.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression/index.shtml\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institute of Mental Health</a> for more on depression.</p>",

The findings showed that substituting just 5 minutes of down time with moderate-to-high intensity walking was linked to a 16 percent decline in the odds of needing knee replacement surgery.</p><p>The study authors defined \"moderate-to-high\" intensity as more than 100 steps per minute. In laymen's terms, Master said, that's a \"brisk\" walk that gets your heart rate up -- not a stroll around the block.</p><p>The findings were presented Saturday at the American College of Rheumatology's annual meeting, in Chicago. Such research should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>Knee osteoarthritis develops when the cartilage cushioning the joint gradually breaks down, which can eventually result in bone scraping on bone.</p><p>The condition is common among middle-aged and older Americans. According to the Arthritis Foundation, up to 13.5 percent of men and 19 percent of women aged 45 and older have knee arthritis that's severe enough to cause pain and other symptoms.</p><p>And those patients often wonder whether walking is good or bad for their arthritic joints, said Dr. Paul Sufka, a rheumatologist at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis.</p><p>\"They often ask whether they should minimize their activity, keep doing what they're doing, or intensify,\" said Sufka, who is also with the American College of Rheumatology's communications committee.</p><p>\"The general advice we give to patients is to stay active,\" Sufka said. But, he added, the truth is  there is too little evidence to give patients definitive recommendations.</p><p>The new findings do not prove that brisk walking directly lowers the risk of needing knee replacement surgery, Sufka noted.</p><p>But,  \"this gives us some useful information to bring to the discussion,\" he added.</p><p>Overall, Sufka said, research does suggest it's better for people with knee arthritis to be active rather than sedentary. And that's not just for the sake of their knees. Physical activity has a range of health benefits, including lower risks of heart attack and stroke.</p><p>Master agreed, and pointed out that exercise can help arthritis patients' mental well-being, as well as physical.</p><p>And it doesn't take a huge lifestyle change, she explained. The new findings suggest people can benefit from adding a short, brisk walk to their day.</p><p>In fact, Sufka said, such incremental shifts may be best.</p><p>\"The best exercise program is the one you can actually stick with,\" he said. \"If right now, you're walking around the block every day, what would be 5 percent or 10 percent more than that? You can gradually build from where you are.\"</p><p>And what if walking is painful? That's a tricky question, Sufka acknowledged. Some patients might benefit from physical therapy rather than only exercising on their own, he said.</p><p>Beyond aerobic exercise like walking, strengthening exercises for the leg muscles supporting the knees can also be helpful, he suggested.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Arthritis Foundation has an overview on <a href=\"https://www.arthritis.org/about-arthritis/where-it-hurts/knee-pain/\" target=\"_new\">knee arthritis</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 9, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The &#35;MeToo movement has given many Americans a glimpse into an unfamiliar world that may have left many wondering, \"What were they thinking?\"</p><p>It turns out they might not have been thinking much at all. New research suggests that almost 9 percent of people in the United States have distress caused by difficulty controlling their sexual feelings, urges and behaviors.</p><p>But the gap between genders was very small: Just over 10 percent of men showed compulsive sexual behavior, compared to 7 percent of women. </p><p>\"Historically, it's been thought that compulsive sexual behaviors affect mostly men. But women are showing that they are experiencing difficulty controlling sexual urges and behavior, too,\" said study author Janna Dickenson. She is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis.</p><p> Dickenson explained that such behaviors can vary widely. \"Some people might masturbate excessively so that it interferes with the ability to work, or someone might be paying for sex so much that it's damaging financially,\" she explained, adding that sexual behaviors become a problem when they influence your life in a way that's destructive.</p><p>So, does that mean people like Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein should be excused for aberrant and potentially criminal behavior?</p><p>\"When anyone faces a problem and there's a classification for that problem, it doesn't mean that it excuses that behavior. [In these cases], there's this link between hypersexuality and non-consent, but these are two separate issues that can be hard to tease apart,\" Dickenson explained.</p><p>Michael Klein, a psychologist at Gracie Square Hospital in New York City, said it's difficult to comment on individual cases, but \"it's possible that these high-profile cases reflect examples of compulsive sexual behavior. However, it may also be better explained by something else, such as taking advantage of a power dynamic, in the context of another [psychological] condition, or any combination of factors.\"</p><p>Mental health professionals have long debated whether or not sexual addiction is an actual addiction or an impulse disorder. What is common to problematic sexual behavior, no matter how it is classified, is substantial difficulty controlling sexual feelings, urges and behaviors to the point that it causes distress and impairment. </p><p>Distress and impairment includes neglecting social activities or personal health, repeatedly attempting to control sexual behavior unsuccessfully, and engaging in sexual behavior despite adverse consequences or minimal pleasure from his or her sexual activities, according to the researchers. </p><p>Using this definition, the study team asked more than 2,000 people to complete a screening test for compulsive sexual disorder. The study participants were already a part of a nationally representative study on sexual health and behavior. They were all between the ages of 18 and 50.</p><p>The researchers expected between 1 percent and 6 percent of the study group would meet the definition of compulsive sexual behavior disorder (CSBD). Instead, 8.6 percent of those screened were found to possibly have CSBD.</p><p>Dickenson said it's important to note that this study only used a screening tool. Someone who tests positive on this test should be referred for further evaluation. </p><p>Klein added that \"a large study such as this helps to increase our understanding of compulsive sexual behavior and related phenomena, as well as provide for future directions of study,\" but there are a lot of issues left to sort out. </p><p>\"There is a difference between feelings and actions, and thoughts and actions; having trouble controlling urges is not the same as acting on urges,\" he said. And cultural, social and religious norms and beliefs can impact how someone feels about sexual behavior. </p><p>Both experts said that if someone is concerned about their sexual behaviors, they should seek help. </p><p>\"People need to realize there is a wide spectrum of sexuality.  Thoughts and feelings are one thing, but behavior that you are unable to control is another matter.  If certain behaviors interfere with your life or cause distress for you or others, you may want to speak with a professional,\" Klein said.</p><p>The study was published online Nov. 9 in the journal <i>JAMA Network Open</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Read more about compulsive sexual behavior from the <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/oct03/compulsive.aspx\" target=\"_new\">American Psychological Association</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 14, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- People with celiac disease must follow a very restrictive diet, but an experimental vaccine may offer many of them the freedom to eat more normally. </p><p>Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder. If someone with the disease eats gluten -- a protein found in wheat, barley and rye -- it can damage the small intestine.</p><p>The vaccine, dubbed Nexvax2, is designed to elicit an immune system response in about 90 percent of people with celiac disease -- specifically those who carry a gene that allows their immune system to \"see\" the vaccine. </p><p>\"People with celiac disease often are afraid of food. Nexvax2 will give them freedom to be able to live life and not be afraid of eating out. It will be socially liberating,\" said Leslie Williams, CEO of ImmusanT, the company developing the vaccine. </p><p>Eating a gluten-free diet isn't easy, according to Alice Bast, CEO of Beyond Celiac, a nonprofit research organization. Cross contamination with foods containing gluten is always a concern, she explained. </p><p>\"Because people with celiac disease note that their toughest challenges are when dining out, socializing and traveling, an effective treatment could bring back some of the freedoms people in our community have lost,\" Bast said. </p><p>\"If [Nexvax2] is effective, it may one day be used to enable people with celiac disease to eat a normal diet that contains gluten without damaging their system or getting sick,\" she said. </p><p>About 1 percent of Americans have celiac disease. Symptoms include stomach pain and bloating, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, weight loss, fatigue, and delayed growth and puberty. Long-term problems can include malnutrition and nervous system problems. </p><p>The current treatment is avoiding gluten. But gluten is found in many foods and products such as lipstick. Even foods that don't directly contain gluten may be contaminated by gluten during the production process. Something as simple as a gluten-free chicken cutlet being fried in a pan previously used to cook a breaded (containing gluten) chicken cutlet may cause damage to someone with celiac disease, Bast explained. </p><p>Williams said that inadvertent gluten exposures like that occur an average of three to four times a month. </p><p>Nexvax2 works by reprogramming the T cells in the immune system that attack the small intestine in people with celiac disease. The injectable vaccine makes these cells nonresponsive to gluten exposure, Williams said. </p><p>The maintenance injections can be given at home with a device that automatically injects the vaccine under the skin. Williams said people would likely need to give themselves a shot once a week to protect themselves from inadvertent gluten exposures. </p><p>ImmusanT has completed five phase 1 trials of Nexvax2, Williams said. Early trials caused patients to vomit, so the initial vaccine dose was lowered. Then it's slowly increased until people are exposed to an amount of gluten that's about equivalent to two loaves of bread. </p><p>Williams said the vaccine was safe and well-tolerated in the early trials. Because it affects a specific part of the immune system, she said there aren't concerns about immune system suppression. </p><p>\"The vaccine targets only the part of the immune system that leads to celiac disease complications throughout the body. Unlike immunotherapy treatments for cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, Nexvax2 does not suppress the whole immune system,\" Bast said. </p><p>ImmusanT is planning a six-month phase 2 study on the vaccine. It will include 150 people with celiac disease from 40 sites in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, Williams noted. She said it's too soon to predict right now when the vaccine might potentially be available. It's also too soon to estimate the cost, she said. </p><p>Bast said that Nexvax2 isn't the only possible treatment for celiac disease in development. </p><p>\"There are more than a dozen therapies in the research pipeline. Nexvax2 is one of three therapeutic vaccines under investigation. Other approaches include preventing gluten from being absorbed by the body, breaking the gluten down using enzymes, and managing the body's reaction to gluten after it is absorbed,\" Bast said. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Celiac Disease Foundation offers more on <a href=\"https://celiac.org/about-celiac-disease/what-is-celiac-disease/\" target=\"_new\">celiac disease</a>.</p>",

USPSTF panels regularly convene to issue evidence-based guidance on a wide variety of medical matters. Their advisories help inform care and insurance coverage.</p><p>The benefits of taking PrEP far outweigh the risks, which can include kidney problems and nausea, the task force announced Tuesday.</p><p>PrEP -- perhaps best known as the two-drug combo pill Truvada (emtricitabine/tenofovir) -- is for use by people who do not have HIV but who are at high risk for getting it for various reasons.</p><p>For example, they may have a regular sex partner infected with HIV; have sex without a condom with a partner or partners whose HIV status is unknown; or share needles or other injection-drug equipment.</p><p>\"The evidence is clear: when taken as prescribed, PrEP is highly effective at preventing HIV,\" panel member Dr. Seth Landefeld said in a task force news release.</p><p>\"To make a difference in the lives of people at high risk for HIV, clinicians need to identify patients who would benefit and offer them PrEP,\" said Landefeld, chair of the department of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine.</p><p>Going forward, physicians should support patients taking PrEP to ensure they take the pill daily for maximum protection, the USPSTF said.</p><p>But while PrEP helps prevent HIV, it does not protect against other sexually transmitted infections, the panel noted. People who take PrEP should still use condoms and follow other safe sex measures to reduce the risk of other sexually transmitted infections.</p><p>In another draft recommendation, the task force reiterated that everyone ages 15 to 65 and all pregnant women should be screened for HIV as part of routine medical care. Younger adolescents and older adults at increased risk for HIV should also be screened.</p><p>\"About 40,000 people are diagnosed with HIV each year. This is why the task force, once again, calls for universal screening for HIV in adolescents and adults ages 15 to 65 years and in all pregnant women,\" task force member Dr. John Epling said in the news release. He is   professor and medical director of research, family and community medicine at Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine.</p><p>\"People deserve to know their HIV status so, if needed, they can start treatment early and live long, healthy lives,\" Epling added.</p><p>There are two ways to screen for HIV -- a conventional blood test sent to the laboratory for analysis, or a rapid test (finger prick or saliva swab) that provides results in less than 15 minutes.</p><p>While overall HIV infection rates in the United States have been going down, rates among some groups are on the rise, most notably among people ages 25 to 29.</p><p>The draft recommendations have been posted for public comment on the task force website and comments can be submitted now through Dec. 26, 2018.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/prep.html\" target=\"_new\">PrEP</a>.</p>",

A new study finds that if you get the wrinkle-relaxing shots today, you can speed up the effect by making faces.</p><p>Simple facial exercises can speed the wrinkle-smoothing effects of botulinum toxin (Botox), according to  researchers from Northwestern University in Chicago.</p><p>\"Patients often leave getting their Botox to the last minute,\" lead researcher and professor of dermatology Dr. Murad Alam said in a university news release.</p><p>\"If people get their botulinum toxin right before a social engagement or important work event, they may worry it won't start working in time,\" he added. \"Speeding up the effects could be important to people.\"</p><p>The new study included 22 adult women with forehead wrinkles who were treated with Botox. Half of them exercised their facial muscles for four hours after the injections, and the other half did not.</p><p>It was quite a workout for the face: Exercises included raised motions of the forehead and scowls in three sets of 40 repetitions, separated by 10 minutes.</p><p>Six months later, the women received another treatment and the two groups reversed doing exercises or no exercises.</p><p>Forehead wrinkles were rated as looking better within just two to three days after the treatment if the injections were followed by the facial exercises, compared with three to four days without the exercises.</p><p>\"Botox binds to receptors on nerve cells to relax muscles, and it is possible that exercise speeds this binding process,\" Alam explained. \"For patients who need quick results, the exercise may be worth the effort. Patients appreciate having more control over their care.\"</p><p>After two weeks, there was no difference between those who did or did not do facial exercises, however. The exercises also made no difference in how long the effects of treatment lasted, according to the study published Oct. 25 in the <i>Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology</i>.</p><p>Alam said that dermatologists have often assumed that face exercises might speed up the effects of Botox treatment, but until now, \"there had not been any well-designed randomized studies comparing exercise and no exercise side-by-side.\"</p><p>So, \"there finally is an answer to the myth of whether or not facial exercises after Botox has any effect,\" said Dr. Michele Green, a dermatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>\"Since so many patients wait until the eleventh hour to do cosmetic procedures, this will be a great way to have the results that they want more quickly,\" said Green, who wasn't involved in the new study.</p><p>In fact, she said, \"I am going to suggest this to all of my patients who are in this circumstance and need 'emergency Botox.'\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Ophthalmology has more on <a href=\"https://www.aao.org/eye-health/treatments/what-is-botox-facial-wrinkles\" target=\"_new\">Botox injections for facial wrinkles</a>.</p>",

Surfing the internet.</p><p>These are activities taken for granted by most, but denied to paralyzed people who've lost the use of their arms and hands.</p><p>Now, thanks to a brain implant, a small group of paralyzed patients can directly operate an off-the-shelf tablet device just by thinking about it.</p><p>The implant reads their brain waves, allowing the participants to move a cursor on their tablet and perform mouse clicks, said lead researcher Dr. Paul Nuyujukian, an assistant professor of bioengineering and neurosurgery at Stanford University in California.</p><p>With their minds alone, the participants navigated commonly used tablet programs, messaged family and friends, looked up websites, checked the weather and shopped online.</p><p>One participant, a musician, even played a bit of Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\" on a digital piano interface.</p><p>\"The tablet became second nature to me, very intuitive,\" one of the participants said in the study. \"It felt more natural than the times I remember using a mouse.\"</p><p>Three paralyzed subjects had a 100-electrode implant placed into the motor regions of the brain, with a thin bundle of wires leading to a plug fixed to the skull, Nuyujukian said. The implant is about the size of a large pea, or a baby aspirin.</p><p>Two of the participants in this latest study had weakness or loss of movement of their arms and legs due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease), a progressive disease affecting the nerves in the brain and spine that control movement. The third participant was paralyzed due to a spinal cord injury.</p><p>The implant monitors brain patterns and feeds them into a computer algorithm, which decodes the thoughts and translates them into wireless signals, researchers said. Those signals are sent to the tablet, allowing subjects to control the device.</p><p>\"If you think back to the old one-button computer mouse of yesteryear, that's the signal we are able to extract from the brain,\" Nuyujukian said. \"It's the equivalent of a cursor velocity and a one-button click.\"</p><p>It usually takes about 5 to 10 minutes to calibrate the system to accurately translate a person's brain waves into cursor movements, Nuyujukian said.</p><p>\"The participant is instructed to imagine moving the cursor to the right or the left or up or down while the cursor is actually making that movement automatically,\" he said. \"It turns out that simply imagining making that movement is very similar to the patterns of neural activity that occur when one actually makes this movement.\"</p><p>Subjects are able to make up to 22 point-and-click selections per minute while using a variety of apps, and type up to 30 characters per minute using standard e-mail and text apps.</p><p>\"Participants can control these on day one. That is possible, and we have shown that,\" Nuyujukian said. \"That's not to say there is no benefit to practice. Our participants definitely feel more comfortable and capable with these systems after a week or two of actually practicing it.\"</p><p>The project is a collaboration that included researchers from Brown University, Massachusetts General Hospital and Stanford. The findings were published Nov. 21 in the journal <i>PLOS ONE</i>.</p><p>Last year, this same research group published a paper in which they were assessing the same patients' ability to type words using their thoughts, said Dr. Thomas Oxley, a clinical instructor and director of innovation strategy at Mount Sinai Hospital Health System's department of neurosurgery in New York City.</p><p>\"They've now gone beyond that to demonstrate that this system can e-mail, text message and surf the internet, amongst other things,\" said Oxley, who wasn't involved with the study. \"Those seem to be the three most-used applications in this group.\"</p><p>The researchers have further honed their system by integrating other useful \"smart\" computer technologies, Oxley said.</p> <p>For example, the paralyzed people's typing speed underwent a \"big jump primarily because they utilized predictive text, and it made a big difference in the patient's capacity to usefully utilize the system and interact with their social network,\" Oxley said.</p><p>This latest advance is the culmination of 15 years of research into brain patterns of movement, built on top of decades of previous neuroscience, Nuyujukian said.</p><p>The system could transform the lives of people with \"locked-in syndrome,\" whose paralysis has robbed them of the ability to speak, Oxley said.</p><p>\"That's so exciting for patients who've lost the capacity to speak, to be able to communicate with their loved ones again,\" Oxley said.</p><p>However, it will be years before the technology reaches the point where it becomes widely available, Nuyujukian said.</p><p>\"The final device needs to be something that's fully implantable, that needs to be miniaturized. It cannot be a giant stack of computers and a giant cart. That's not a clinical device,\" Nuyujukian said. \"It needs to be something that is just as accessible and easy to use as many of the other implantable technologies that we have for interacting with the brain, like deep brain stimulators or cochlear implants.</p><p>\"This isn't something that will be clinically available, say, next year,\" Nuyujukian noted.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation has more about <a href=\"https://www.christopherreeve.org/living-with-paralysis\" target=\"_new\">living with paralysis</a>.</p>",

But the new findings suggest that the antiplatelet drug, called ACT017, may be a safe and effective alternative to current therapies used in stroke patients.</p><p>\"Any way to minimize bleeding risk after administering antiplatelet agents is highly desirable,\" said one expert, Dr. Andrew Rogove. He directs stroke services at Northwell Health's Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y.</p><p>\"Further investigation of this promising drug in treatment of acute ischemic stroke is warranted and necessary,\" said Rogove, who wasn't involved in the new study.</p><p>This early, phase 1 trial of ACT017 was funded by the drug's maker, Acticor-Biotech. It included 36 healthy men and women, aged 22 to 65, who were divided into six groups.</p><p>Each group received intravenous infusions of the drug over six hours with doses ranging from 62.5 milligrams (mg) to 2,000 mg.</p><p>The drug did not significantly extend \"bleeding time\" -- a marker of increased risk for dangerous bleeds, said a team led by Dr. Martine Jandrot-Perrus, a scientist at France's National Institute of Health and Medical Research. </p><p>ACT017 was also well-tolerated at all doses, without serious side effects, her team reported, although a dose of 2,000 mg was most effective. The most common side effects were mild to moderate headache and head discomfort.</p><p>The findings were published April 18 in the journal <i>Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology</i>.</p><p>Jandrot-Perrus said there is a clear need for a drug to treat acute stroke that prevents clotting without increasing the risk of bleeding.</p><p>ACT017 inhibits blood platelet clumping and clot formation by targeting a protein in platelets that plays a critical role in clot formation, the researchers explained.</p><p>\"Our results are quite encouraging because they show the candidate compound is well-tolerated at doses even twice as high as the ones targeted for a future treatment and without any signs of bleeding,\" Jandrot-Perrus said in a journal news release. </p><p>She said the drug's action on platelets is fast, specific and largely reversible within 24 hours. </p><p>Another U.S. stroke expert agreed that doctors have long sought better, safer blood thinners.</p><p>\"The biggest impediment to removal of clots has always been the risk of bleeding that each treatment carries with it,\" said Dr. Salman Azhar, director of stroke care at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>Azhar explained that ACT017 seems to \"prevent formation of clots on the inner lining of the exposed blood vessel -- as is found in strokes and heart attacks -- without interfering with the ability of platelets to prevent bleeding elsewhere in the body if needed.\"</p><p>But he said more study -- in actual stroke patients -- is needed.</p><p>\"The caveat here is, of course, that this study was in normal volunteers without a clot and/or damaged brain tissue,\" Azhar said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Stroke Association has more on <a href=\"https://www.strokeassociation.org/en/life-after-stroke/preventing-another-stroke/anti-clotting-agents-explained\" target=\"_new\">anti-clotting drugs</a>.</p>",

People at higher risk of severe illness include those with weakened immune systems or existing respiratory or cardiac disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <i>CNN</i> reported.</p><p>This outbreak \"is affecting medically fragile children with severely compromised immune systems. The strain has been particularly associated with disease in communal living arrangements and can be more severe,\" the health department said.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>120 Salmonella Cases in 22 States in Outbreak Linked to Ground Beef</b></span></p><p>The number of illnesses in a salmonella outbreak linked to recalled ground beef has risen to 120 people in 22 states, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.</p><p>Since the last update on Oct. 4, there have been 63 illnesses reported and six more states reported cases. The most recent illness began on Sept. 28. Thirty-three people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.</p><p>The CDC says consumers and retailers should not serve, sell or eat recalled ground beef produced by JBS Tolleson, Inc., of Arizona. The company recalled about 6.5 million pounds of beef products, including ground beef, that may be contaminated with salmonella.</p><p>The recalled meat was sold under many different brand names and many different stores. A complete list of stores and states where the recalled ground beef was sold is on the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service website.</p><p>In most cases, salmonella infection results in diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps 12 to 72 hours after eating contaminated food. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most people recover without treatment, according to the CDC.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Progress Against U.S. Opioid Crisis, HHS Secretary Says</b></span></p><p>There may be progress in the fight against U.S. drug overdose deaths, according to health secretary Alex Azar.</p><p>\"We are so far from the end of the epidemic, but we are perhaps, at the end of the beginning,\" Azar said Tuesday at a health care event sponsored by the Milken Institute think tank, the <i>Associated Press</i> reported.</p><p>He said that from late last year through early this year, the number of overdose deaths \"has begun to plateau,\" meaning that such deaths appear to be rising more slowly than before.</p><p>More than 70,000 people died of drug overdoses last year, according to preliminary data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this summer. That's 10 percent higher than in 2016.</p><p>Other preliminary figures released earlier this month by the CDC suggest that the rate of increase in overdose deaths between December 2017 and March 2018 slowed to 3 percent, compared with 10 percent over the previous 12 months, the <i>AP</i> reported.</p><p>In his speech, Azar suggested that a number of efforts are helping bring the overdose epidemic under control.</p><p>These include an increase in treatment with medications such as buprenorphine and naltrexone, much greater access to the overdose-reversing drug naloxone, and a decline in misuse of prescription opioids as doctors are being more careful in prescribing the painkillers, the <i>AP</i> reported.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Why Cancer Risk Is Higher in Taller Folk</b></span></p><p>Taller people are more likely than shorter people to develop cancer because they have more cells in their body in which cancer-causing mutations can occur, according to a new study.</p><p>Previous research has found that for every 10 centimeters (4-inches) of height within the typical range for people, there is a 10 percent higher risk of cancer, <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper in the U.K. reported.</p><p>A number of theories have been suggested to explain this, but this new study by Leonard Nunney, professor of biology at the University of California Riverside, suggests it just comes down to a person's size.</p><p>Tall people simply have more cells in which cancer can develop, according to the study in the journal <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</i>.</p><p>\"Whether that comes from a better diet or the fact that your parents happen to be tall doesn't matter  it is purely a number of cells, however that comes about,\" Nunney told <i>The Guardian</i>.</p><p>However, he noted that height differences don't fully explain why men are at higher risk for many cancers than women.</p><p>Taller people don't need to be concerned about their cancer risk, according to Georgina Hill, Cancer Research UK.</p><p>\"A number of studies over the years have shown that taller people seem to have a slightly higher risk of cancer,\" she told <i>The Guardian</i>. \"But the increased risk is small and there's plenty you can do to reduce the risk of developing cancer, such as not smoking and keeping a healthy weight.\"</p>",

He is chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y.</p><p>That's not to say it's easy. Researchers found that grandparents who take on a late-in-life role of parenting tend to be in worse physical and mental health than actual parents. They are also more likely to be single and to struggle financially.</p><p>But responses offered in the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health by roughly 46,000 caregivers in grandparent- and parent-led households suggested that grandparents are no more overwhelmed by the burden of caregiving than parents are.</p><p>Why are more grandparents finding themselves having to make this tough choice?</p><p>\"The reasons for this are many, with fatal overdoses related to the opioid epidemic responsible for a significant proportion of these cases,\" Adesman said.</p><p> \"Child abuse or neglect is another frequent reason for children being placed with their grandparents,\" he noted. \"Other common reasons include mental health problems of one or both parents, or unexpected deaths due to health problems or motor vehicle accidents.\"</p><p>Adesman is to present his team's findings Monday at the American Academy of Pediatrics meeting, in Orlando, Fla. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>The survey enlisted nearly 45,000 parent-led households, of which about 5,000 were single parents. Grandparent-led families made up another 1,250 of those surveyed.</p><p>The researchers found that grandparent caregivers were more likely to care for black children and have a lower level of educational attainment. They were also more likely to say they had nobody to turn to for emotional support (31 percent of grandparents versus 24 percent of parents).</p><p>Children cared for by grandparents were more apt to lose their temper, argue, and/or become anxious or angry when confronted with change, according to the report.</p><p>But the researchers found no appreciable difference between grandparents and parents in terms of being bothered or angered by their child, and neither group suggested that caregiving was more difficult.</p><p>Amy Goyer, family and caregiving expert at AARP, observed that the roughly 5.7 million American children now being raised by grandparents are following a well-trodden path.</p><p>She noted, for example, that President George Washington and his wife Martha raised two of Martha's grandchildren.</p><p> Goyer also pointed out that, on average, first-time grandparents are in their late 40s, \"so it's important not to assume these grandparents are older than they are.\"</p><p>But Goyer, who is the former head of the AARP's Grandparenting Program, also said that \"the phenomenon of grandparents raising grandchildren has risen in recent decades, due to increased problems with substance abuse and addiction, incarceration, divorce and military deployment among other issues.\"</p><p>In that context, she suggested that the relatively positive findings are somewhat surprising, \"considering the extreme challenges so many grandparent caregivers face.\"</p><p> Goyer pointed out that \"this issue hits families in every socioeconomic level, but we know that grandparents with lower incomes struggle all the more with the extra costs. These children often have chronic health problems, mental illness. They have suffered trauma. They may be born addicted or suffer from attachment disorders. They tend to have more learning disabilities, and they may have more behavioral problems.\"</p><p>Still, grandparents have a leg up when it comes to experience, she added. \"They do this out of love. They do it because they want to keep their family together. They are motivated, and they are survivors,\" Goyer said.</p><p>The bottom-line is that \"children raised by relatives do better than those being raised in foster care,\" she said. \"There is the continuity of family. A child's identity is so closely tied to their family and being with grandparents helps continue that. The love from a grandparent is a special thing.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on grandparents as caregivers at <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/relationships/friends-family/info-08-2011/grandfamilies-guide-support.html\" target=\"_new\">AARP</a>.</p>",

That's a relative increase of 28 percent, the researchers noted.</p><p>But it's not much different from 1999, when the rate hovered just under 4.5 firearms deaths per 100,000 children, or the 2007 rate of 3.9 deaths per 100,000.</p><p>Between 2013 and 2016, gun-related homicides among children rose 32 percent, and gun-related suicides increased by 26 percent, according to the report.</p><p>\"We see more suicide in rural areas and more homicide in urban areas, but nonetheless, firearms are a safety problem for children across all neighborhoods. They're in everyone's back yard,\" Cunningham said.</p><p>The difference in progress can be chalked up to the interest, emphasis and money that the public has placed on motor vehicle deaths versus firearms deaths, she added.</p><p>\"We've invested a lot of money in traffic safety research. There's been a lot of investment in counseling families and teens around driving more safely. We've invested a lot in safer vehicles. We've invested a lot in safer roads. We've spent a lot of money on research to see which of those factors matter. We've invested as a country tremendously. We do not want these many people dying on the roads, and we've changed that,\" Cunningham said. </p><p>\"The message around firearm injury is we haven't invested at all. As a country, we've invested really not at all in firearm-related research, in doing any of the public health and injury prevention science we know could contribute to a decrease,\" she continued. </p><p>\"We've seen tremendous decreases in all other types of injury when we've applied research to them,\" Cunningham explained. \"We haven't done that with firearms, and because we haven't done that, we have pretty much a flat line, with the bump of the last couple of years even going in the wrong direction.\"</p><p>The report by Cunningham and her colleagues was published in the  Dec. 20 issue of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p>According to Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, the United States can halt these reversals through \"common sense and practical behaviors that can save our children's lives.\"</p><p>These include \"eliminating distractions, such as texting while driving, and getting more sleep to reduce driver fatigue and drowsiness,\" Glatter said. \"When it comes to gun safety, proper storage of guns along with novel biometrics to keep triggers locked could also be lifesaving.\"</p><p> Of the 20,360 deaths among U.S. children and teenagers that occurred in 2016, injuries caused more than 60 percent, Cunningham's team found.</p><p>Rural kids were most at risk with 33 deaths per 100,000, compared with 27 per 100,000 for suburban kids, and 23 per 100,000 for urban children, the study authors said.</p><p>That's mainly due to higher injury-related deaths in rural settings. For example, rural children and teens died 2.7 times more frequently in motor vehicle crashes. One factor in these deaths could be longer emergency medical service response times. </p><p>\"The bottom line is that we need to be proactive by focusing on research related to injury prevention, as opposed to being reactive once tragic events occur,\" Glatter said. \"We owe it to our children and future generations.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/safechild/index.html\" target=\"_new\">preventing childhood injuries</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 24, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Millions of Americans take angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to lower their blood pressure, but a new study suggests they might also increase their odds of developing lung cancer.</p><p>Among people taking these drugs for more than five years, the increased risk may be as high as 14 percent. Although that seems a small number, it could represent a large number of patients, the study authors noted.</p>  <p>\"The silver lining of our findings is that while we found an association, the risk at the individual patient level is likely low, even after 10 years of use,\" said lead researcher Laurent Azoulay, an associate professor of epidemiology and oncology at McGill University in Montreal.</p><p>\"For this reason, this should not deter patients from taking these drugs, should their physician deem the treatment appropriate,\" he said.</p><p>Azoulay also cautioned that this is an observational study, and it can't prove these drugs actually cause lung cancer.</p><p>Although ACE inhibitors are great for lowering blood pressure, they may also increase chemicals in the body that are linked with lung cancer, he explained.</p><p>Specifically, chemicals called bradykinin and substance P in the lung have been found in lung cancer tissue, and bradykinin may stimulate the growth of lung cancer.</p><p>Common ACE inhibitors include Lotensin (benazepril), Prinivil (lisinopril) and Altace (ramipril).</p><p>Deirdre Cronin Fenton, from the department of clinical epidemiology at Aarhus University in Denmark, said patients should weigh the benefits of these drugs against a small possible risk.</p><p>\"In an individual patient, any concerns about the risk of lung cancer should be balanced by the survival benefit associated with the use of ACE inhibitors,\" said Cronin Fenton, who wrote an editorial that accompanied the study.</p><p>Both were published Oct. 24 in the medical journal <i>BMJ</i>. </p><p>For the study, Azoulay and his colleagues collected data on nearly 1 million patients whose medical records were in a British database. These patients began taking drugs to control blood pressure between 1995 and 2015. </p><p>The participants were at least 18, with no history of cancer, and they were followed up for an average of six years. During that time, nearly 8,000 developed lung cancer. </p><p>After accounting for factors that might influence the findings, such as age, gender, weight, smoking, drinking and history of lung disease, Azoulay's team found that ACE inhibitors were tied to a 14 percent increased risk for lung cancer. </p><p>The risk for lung cancer was seen after five years of taking these drugs. For those who took them for more than 10 years, the risk increased to 31 percent, the researchers found. </p><p>A specialist not involved with the new study said patients taking ACE inhibitors should not worry because the benefits of these drugs far outweigh any risk for lung cancer. </p><p>\"ACE inhibitors have been extensively studied in a multitude of large-scale, randomized clinical trials in very diverse patient populations,\" said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. </p><p>In these trials, the benefits of ACE inhibitors have outweighed any potential risks, and many of these studies showed reductions in deaths without any evidence of an increased risk of cancer in general or lung cancer in particular, he said. </p><p>\"These findings should not raise concerns about the safety of ACE inhibitors,\" Fonarow said. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine for more on <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000087.htm\" target=\"_new\">ACE inhibitors</a>.</p>",

If you feel drowsy when driving, find a safe place to pull over and nap.

These hormones can stay higher, encouraging weight regain, <i>for more than a year</i>, even after the pounds start creeping back.</p><p>So the tendency for weight regain could be part of the body's natural instinct and not simply because you went back to old eating habits. To combat this, you need to keep a diet mindset for at least one year after you reach your goal weight.</p><p>But what can you do if that weight has already started coming back? First, go easy on yourself. Dieting takes dedicated effort and you don't want to waste energy blaming yourself.</p><p>Next, go back to all the diet principles that helped you lose weight. Do a self-checkup to see if your portions have gotten bigger recently, if you're eating too often, or if you're not being as careful about the quality of calories you choose as you were when you were losing weight.</p><p>It may also be that you aren't exercising as much as you did. While calorie restriction seems to increase appetite, exercise can reduce it as well as burn off calories. A study published in the <i>Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism</i> found that exercising after a meal may extend the feeling of satisfaction that the food gave you. This could be helpful in coping with smaller portions.</p><p>Just be sure not to overeat right before exercise. A small snack is OK, but you should wait two hours after a full meal so that digestion isn't fighting against your workout efforts.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>To help you calculate the right amount of calories to both get to and stay at your desired weight, use the <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/body-weight-planner\" target=\"_new\">body weight planner tool</a> from the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.</p>",

But the university recently announced that a years-long investigation discovered \"falsified and/or fabricated data\" in 31 papers from Anversa's laboratory, the <i>Washington Post</i> reported.</p><p>Anversa worked at the hospital until 2015. Last year, the hospital reached a $10 million settlement with the Justice Department to settle allegations that fake data was used by Anversa's laboratory in grant applications for federal funding.</p><p>Before working at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Anversa worked at New York Medical College.

But could a simple vaccine help prevent a recurrence in stroke survivors someday?</p><p>That's the promise from new Japanese research conducted in mice.</p><p>A vaccine that would replace or be used alongside standard heart pills might help prevent secondary strokes and possibly heart attacks, saving many lives, said study co-author Dr. Hironori Nakagami, a professor at Osaka University.</p><p>\"Many stroke patients don't take their blood-thinning drugs as prescribed, which makes it more likely they will have another stroke,\" he explained. \"This vaccine might one day help solve this issue since it would only need to be injected periodically.\"</p><p>As the researchers noted, people who've suffered a stroke caused by a blood clot often taken blood-thinning drugs afterwards, to cut the risk of a second stroke. But these drugs can also raise the odds of serious bleeding.</p><p>However, in mice at least, the experimental vaccine protected against blood clots for more than two months. It did so without increasing the risk of bleeding or causing any autoimmune response, and it worked as well as the blood-thinner pill clopidogrel (Plavix), Nakagami's team reported Oct. 29 in <i>Hypertension</i>.</p><p>Of course, many findings from animal studies fail to pan out in humans. But Nakagami said his team members plan to test the vaccine in people in the future.</p><p>\"We are continuing our research in hopes of being able to start clinical trials between five and 10 years from now, but there are differences between mice and humans in how the vaccine will be recognized by the immune system,\" Nakagami said in a journal news release. \"We should be able to overcome such problems and believe this vaccine provides a very promising strategy in secondary prevention of stroke.\"</p><p>One U.S. stroke expert believes the strategy may hold promise.</p><p>\"Experimentally, this sounds promising,\" said Dr. Satjit Bhusri, a cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>However, the vaccine's effectiveness in stroke survivors \"may be more complicated,\" Bhusri noted.

In fact, a 2009 study showed that simply viewing an image of a person smoking can trigger someone who has recently quit to abandon their newfound resolve.</p> <p>The classic example of how a trigger works is from Psychology 101: Pavlov's dogs salivated every time they heard Ivan Pavlov ring a bell because the researcher always rang a bell before feeding them.</p> <p>\"We too have these conditioned responses,\" said clinical psychologist Barry J. Jacobs, a Pennsylvania-based clinical psychologist and health care consultant. \"Certain stimuli wind up giving us a certain response.\"</p> <p>Jacobs, who specializes in helping people form good health habits, adds that when a person smokes while drinking coffee, for example, cigarettes and coffee eventually become associated so that when the person drinks coffee he or she automatically wants a cigarette. \"Coffee becomes a trigger,\" he said.</p> <p>Triggers come in a few categories. Etta Short, director of clinical development and support at Optum, a corporate tobacco cessation program, said dependence on the nicotine in tobacco causes physical cravings that become paired with actions and emotions throughout the day.</p> <p>Triggers associated with behaviors include driving, finishing a meal or talking on the phone. Environmental triggers include spending time with smoking friends or being at a bar or music concert. And emotional triggers can include stress, boredom, anger or even pleasurable feelings.</p> <p>For Poirrier, who started smoking at age 20 while on a college exchange program in France, it was a business trip. Although he had quit smoking two years earlier, returning to Paris caused a personal trigger so strong and so unexpected that he relapsed.</p> <p>\"I think the need to smoke was fueled by nostalgia,\" said Poirrier, who smoked for more than two decades.</p> <p>His relapse was short-lived. He walked throughout the city smoking the cigarettes in that single pack for hours, then took the metro back to his hotel, smoked one last cigarette outside and tossed the remainder.</p> <p>That was in 2014. \"I haven't smoked since,\" he said.</p> <p>Poirrier initially quit when his workplace became smoke-free, which caused him to cut back from his three-pack-a-day habit to one pack a day. But he also had a constant cough, struggled to catch his breath when walking up stairs and was concerned about the effects of secondhand smoke on his kids. He said staying focused on the benefits of not smoking helps him to avoid triggers now.</p> <p>Tying your motivation to quit to those types of core values can really help, Short said. \"Living up to core values is a strong intrinsic reinforcement that helps the person stick to the plan and not let triggers get in the way of the resolve.\"</p> <p>Short said the way to turn your back on triggers is to anticipate them and make a plan with coping strategies, such as substitutes for smoking, distractions, relaxation techniques and motivating statements. She also recommends nicotine replacement therapy to manage physical cravings so that the person can stay focused.</p> <p>\"The first two to four weeks are the toughest,\" she said. \"But for many people, it takes much longer for all triggers to fade.\"</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 23, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Type 2 diabetes has reached alarming numbers in the United States. But you can prevent or delay it through healthy eating and active living, an expert suggests.</p><p>Diabetes affects more than 30 million Americans, and type 2 is the most common form. As many as one-third of Americans have prediabetes, but most don't know it, according to the American Association of Diabetes Educators.</p><p>Small lifestyle changes, like signing up for a morning exercise class, can help protect you from type 2 diabetes and its complications, according to association spokesperson Kathleen Stanley of Lexington, Ky. </p><p>Here, she shares some other tips: </p><p><b>Determine your personal risk. </b>Find out if your family has a history of diabetes, because that puts you at increased risk. Men have a higher risk than women. Your ethnic background is also important. Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Pacific Islanders are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes.</p><p><b>Assess your lifestyle and make any necessary changes.</b> Get at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week -- about a half-hour most days of the week. Plan three 10-minute walks during the day to get away from your desk. Climb the stairs instead of taking the elevator. </p><p><b>Watch your plate</b>. Eat a balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats and whole, nourishing foods. Vegetables and fruit should occupy half your plate.</p><p><b>Maintain a healthy weight.</b> Your body mass index (BMI) should be lower than 25, or lower than 23 for Asian American Pacific Islanders. BMI is an estimate of body fat based on height and weight. Research shows that losing just 5 percent to 7 percent of your body weight can reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes by more than half.</p><p><b>Talk to your doctor</b>. Ask how to safely get more active and have a healthier diet. Get support for your lifestyle changes. Find out if there's a National Diabetes Prevention Program in your neighborhood. If there isn't an in-person program, check online. Other options include joining an exercise group, fitness facility, yoga or dance studio, or senior center.</p><p><b>Get tested</b>. A simple blood test (fasting glucose) can reveal if you have prediabetes, a condition where blood sugar is consistently higher than normal. Discuss your risk of type 2 diabetes with your doctor.</p><p>Diabetes can cause serious health complications, such as stroke, heart disease, vision loss and foot problems.</p> <p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases has more on <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/preventing-type-2-diabetes\" target=\"_new\">diabetes prevention</a>.</p>",

It will also help to have a plan for any leftovers, such as a brown bag lunch the next day.</p><p>Be sure the seafood is fresh when you buy it. At the store, it should be refrigerated or displayed on ice in a case or under a cover. Fish should smell like the sea, not fishy or ammonia-like -- those are signs of spoilage in raw or cooked fish.</p><p>Seafood shopping tips:</p><ul><li>The eyes of whole fish should be clear and bulge slightly.</li> <li>Flesh should be shiny, not slimy, and spring back when pressed.</li><li>Shrimp flesh should be translucent.</li></ul><p>Consider buying frozen seafood, like bags of shrimp, which can be economical and used as needed.</p><p>At home, store fresh seafood properly so it won't spoil before you can eat it. If you'll cook it within two days, you can put it in the fridge, optimally on ice. Otherwise, wrap it tightly in paper and then plastic, and freeze.</p><p>Thaw frozen seafood gradually in a fridge overnight. If you're in a hurry, place it in a sealed plastic bag and immerse it in cold water. If you'll be cooking it immediately, you can microwave it on the defrost setting, but stop when the fish is just pliable and still a bit icy.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has detailed information on <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/food/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm077331.htm\" target=\"_new\">seafood storage</a>, including helpful videos.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Dec. 12, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- For certain men with early prostate cancer, choosing surgery over \"watchful waiting\" may add a few years to their lives, a new study suggests.</p><p>European researchers found that among nearly 700 men with earlier-stage prostate cancer, those who received surgery to remove the gland lived three years longer, on average, than those assigned to watchful waiting.</p><p>However, experts had major caveats about the study, which followed men who were treated for prostate cancer 20 to 30 years ago.</p><p>Namely, the patients had tumors that were larger and more aggressive than the norm for men diagnosed with early prostate cancer in recent years. So the results cannot be translated to most men diagnosed today, experts said.</p><p>\"This is an important study with useful information. But it won't change how we manage prostate cancer today,\" said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, interim chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society.</p><p>The study authors themselves made the same point.</p><p>Lead researcher Dr. Anna Bill-Axelson stressed that the patients were different from many men diagnosed with prostate cancer these days -- because they all had \"clinically detected\" cancer.</p><p>Many were diagnosed, for instance, after they developed symptoms of prostate cancer. In other cases, a doctor felt the tumor while doing a rectal exam for other reasons.</p><p>In other words, their tumors were advanced enough to cause symptoms or be palpable.</p><p>That's in sharp contrast to the situation today, Lichtenfeld said. In the United States, most men are now diagnosed through PSA screening, a blood test that picks up tiny prostate tumors that are not causing any problems.</p><p>Often, those men do not need immediate treatment, because prostate cancer is typically slow-growing and may never progress to the point of being life-threatening. Experts say that surgery to remove the gland -- which can cause incontinence and erectile dysfunction -- could do more harm than good.</p><p>Instead, men diagnosed through PSA screening can often take a wait-and-see approach -- where their cancer is monitored, and treated only if it progresses.</p><p>\"The last thing I'd want to see is headlines saying, 'Surgery is better than no surgery,'\" Lichtenfeld said. \"That's not what this study tells us.\"</p><p>The findings are based on 695 European men diagnosed with prostate cancer that was still confined to the gland.</p><p>All were younger than 75 and in good enough health that their life expectancy was at least 10 more years.</p><p>Between 1989 and 1999, the men were randomly assigned to either have their prostate gland removed or have their disease monitored.</p><p>By 2017, researchers found that 72 percent of surgery patients had died, versus 84 percent of men in the watchful-waiting group. The rate of death from prostate cancer, specifically, was also lower in the surgery group: 20 percent versus 31 percent.</p><p>On average, the study found, surgery patients lived three years longer.</p><p>But that added life expectancy would not necessarily be seen in men diagnosed through PSA screening, said Bill-Axelson, of Uppsala University in Sweden. </p><p>\"PSA adds a lead time of at least eight years,\" she said.</p><p>And many of those men, she added, will ultimately develop and die from other health conditions, like heart disease.</p><p>That was true even in this study, Bill-Axelson noted, despite the fact that patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer much later than they typically are today.</p><p>Overall, she said, about 70 percent of the men died of some other cause.</p><p>What about men today whose cancer is not caught by PSA screening, but after they develop symptoms?</p><p>Even then, immediate surgery is not always the best option, Lichtenfeld said. There are other factors to weigh, he explained -- such as the size and aggressiveness of the tumor, and a man's age and general health. An elderly man in poor health is unlikely to see any benefit from surgery.</p><p>But, Lichtenfeld said, if a man is like those in this study -- with a life expectancy of a decade or more -- surgery is likely to be recommended.</p><p>The study appears in the Dec. 13 issue of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Cancer Society has more on <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostate-cancer.html\" target=\"_new\">prostate cancer</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Oct. 30, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- If you insist on dressing your pet in a costume for Halloween, Fido will thank you for doing so in a safe and comfortable way, veterinarians suggest.</p><p>\"Make sure costumes are the appropriate size and fit for the pet. A costume that is too tight will be constricting and uncomfortable, and a costume that is too loose may rub and cause skin irritation; in either case, the pet may have difficulty moving around and will not enjoy their experience,\" said   Leni Kaplan. She is a clinician at Cornell University's Hospital for Animals.</p><p>\"Costumes with accessories that are easy to grab or pull off are not recommended; a pet might eat the accessory predisposing them to a gastrointestinal foreign body obstruction, which will require veterinary medical attention and possible surgery,\" Kaplan warned in a Cornell news release.</p><p> Katherine Houpt is professor emeritus of behavior medicine at Cornell's College of Veterinary Medicine. She suggested if you're planning to dress up your pet, \"make the costume a signal that good things are about to happen, like a walk. Another method is to pair a tiny, but delicious snack with the placement of the costume.\"</p><p>Costumes aren't the only thing you need be careful with: Halloween candy may be a treat for you, but could be dangerous for animals.</p><p> Kaplan explained that, for pets, \"candy and human snacks can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration and, in some circumstances, pancreatitis -- a serious illness which may require hospitalization. Restrict access to chocolate, coffee, caffeine, macadamia nuts, grapes, raisins and any food containing xylitol or psychoactive cannabinoids, such as marijuana.\"</p><p>It's also probably a bad idea to take your dog trick-or-treating.</p><p>\"It is not advised to take your dog trick-or-treating -- due to crowds, children, unfamiliar people dressed in unfamiliar outerwear (costumes, masks, and carrying props). Dogs who are normally fine in crowds may be scared or spooked, and may act aggressively or out of character,\" Kaplan said. </p><p>\"If you do take your pet trick-or-treating, make sure to dress your pet in brightly colored and reflective clothing so they are easy to see at night, and keep them on a leash at all times,\" Kaplan added.</p><p>Halloween decorations can also pose risks to your pet, the vets added.</p><p>\"Pumpkin is safe for pets to eat as long as it is not moldy. If your pet eats moldy pumpkin, contact a veterinarian immediately,\" Kaplan said.</p><p>\"Avoid using real candles, as pets are often drawn to the flickering light and warmth. They could burn themselves or start a fire if the candle or Jack-o'-Lantern is tipped over,\" she noted. \"Instead of candles, use battery-powered LED candles or glow sticks. Make sure your pet cannot access and eat the LED candles or glow sticks.\" </p><p>If Halloween hijinks are too much for your dog,  take steps to keep your pet calm.</p><p>For example, Houpt suggested, \"During parties or trick-or-treater visits, dogs can be confined in a room with a long-lasting treat or a food-dispensing toy. Play loud music or white noise so the dog is unaware of the people.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has more on <a href=\"https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/halloween-safety-tips\" target=\"_new\">Halloween safety for pets</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 2, 2018 (HealthDay News) --  Mental health issues are sending more and more kids and teens to  hospital emergency rooms, and that increase has been most dramatic among minorities, a new report shows.</p><p>Between 2012 and 2016, overall admissions  shot up 50 percent in the United States, the researchers said.</p><p>\"Prior to our study, we knew that an increasing number of children with mental health concerns were coming to the nation's pediatric emergency departments,\" said study author Dr. Anna Abrams. She is a resident physician with the Children's National Health System in Washington, D.C.</p><p>\"What this new research demonstrates is that not only are these visits increasing at a staggering rate, but that there are significant racial and ethnic disparities in the trends of who visits pediatric emergency departments for mental health issues,\" Abrams said.</p><p>Why this is so remains unclear, she noted.</p><p>\"Our study really was an effort to characterize the frequency of these emergency department visits,\" Abrams explained. \"It was not designed to investigate the potential reasons that triggered these visits. We do plan to investigate this question in future work.\"</p><p>Abrams and her colleagues plan to present their findings Friday at an  American Academy of Pediatrics  meeting, in Orlando, Fla. The  research should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>The study team said that more than 17 million American children struggle with some form of psychiatric illness. In recent years, that has meant that somewhere between 2 percent to 5 percent of all pediatric visits to the emergency department have been related to mental illness concerns.</p><p>To drill down on the trends, the investigators sifted through data that had been collected by the Pediatric Health Information System.</p><p>The team focused on the overall number of mental health-related visits to an emergency department among children up to the age of 21.</p><p>The mental health issues covered by the analysis included: acute anxiety and delirium states; adjustment disorders and neuroses; alcohol abuse; drug abuse (including opioid abuse); bipolar disorders; childhood behavioral disorders; depression; major depressive disorders; disorders of personality and impulse control; eating disorders; psychosis; and schizophrenia.</p><p>During the study period, investigators determined that more than 293,000 children -- who were an average age of just over 13 -- had been diagnosed for some type of mental illness in a pediatric emergency room setting.</p><p>Overall, these visits rose dramatically during the study period, up from about 50 visits for every 100,000 children in 2012 to nearly 79 visits per 100,000 by 2016, according to the report.</p><p>But when broken down by race, the investigators found that the observed rise had not unfurled at an equal pace.</p><p>For example, nearly 52 out of every 100,000 white children were visiting an ER for a mental health issue by 2016. But among black children, that figure shot up to 78. Among other non-Hispanic minorities, the number rose to more than 79.</p><p>The majority of all pediatric mental health visits (55 percent) was covered by some form of public insurance, the study authors noted.</p><p>William Tynan is director of integrated health care with the American Psychological Association. He said he wouldn't be surprised if the study actually underestimates the degree to which mental health is the central concern among pediatric ER visits.</p><p>\"I would have estimated 10 percent, so the 2 percent to 5 percent  looks low to me,\" Tynan said.</p><p>As for the observed racial disparities, Tynan suggested that they are likely \"a function of social circumstances.\"</p><p>Poverty aside, \"families go to the emergency department because, in general, when there is a problem with a child  -- either medical or behavioral -- all parents feel a sense of urgency and want it addressed immediately,\" Tynan said.</p><p>But, \"we do know that children in poverty who have been exposed to social stressors -- and sometimes more trauma and violence -- have a higher risk of disorders, so the numbers on differences between black and white need to be compared with poverty rates,\" he added.</p><p>On that front, Tynan noted that some estimates put the poverty rate for black children at 27 percent, compared with just 10 percent among white children. Pew Research paints an even starker divide, he added: 38 percent among black kids versus 11 percent among their white peers.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on children and mental health at the <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/child-and-adolescent-mental-health/index.shtml\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institute of Mental Health</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 1, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- More men are delaying fatherhood, and new research suggests that might raise the risk of both birth complications and infant health problems.</p><p>When new fathers are aged 45 or older, there's an increased chance of preterm birth, infant seizures and even gestational diabetes in the mother, the study found.</p><p>\"When you think about fertility, don't forget the father. Having a baby is a team sport, and fathers do play a role as well,\" said study senior author Dr. Michael Eisenberg. He is director of male reproductive medicine and surgery at Stanford University School of Medicine in California.</p><p>\"Men shouldn't think of their runway as unlimited. There may be some health implications from waiting,\" he said.</p><p>But men shouldn't panic either. Eisenberg said to think of the potential risks like you would the lottery. If you buy two tickets, you've doubled your odds of winning, but you still probably won't hit the jackpot. Likewise, if you increase your risk of birth complications or child health problems slightly, the chances are still good that everything will be OK.</p><p>Eisenberg and his colleagues started the study because more men are choosing to have kids at older ages. Almost one in 10 children are fathered by a man over 40, the researchers noted. Yet, scant research has looked at how dad's age contributes to the way a pregnancy progresses and to the health of the child.</p><p>The study looked at data from more than 40 million births between 2007 and 2016. For infants, the researchers looked at birth weight, Apgar score at 5 minutes, admission to neonatal intensive care, seizures and the need for postpartum antibiotics. In moms, the researchers looked at the incidence of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia (dangerously high blood pressure during pregnancy). </p><p>The researchers controlled their findings to account for the mother's gestational age. They also controlled for education level, marital status, smoking history and access to care.</p><p>The investigators found that the greater the father's age, the greater the risk of problems. Men aged 45 and older had a 14 percent higher risk of a child being born prematurely. Men who were 50 or older had a 28 percent increased risk of that outcome, the study authors said.</p><p>Dads aged 45 and older also had an 18 percent higher risk of having an infant who had seizures compared to fathers between the ages of 25 and 34. They also had a 34 percent higher risk of having a partner who had gestational diabetes.</p> <p>Eisenberg said he can only speculate on why older dads might face these higher risks. He said there are some mutations in sperm DNA as men age, and those changes might impact the pregnancy and child. It's also possible that epigenetic changes that affect the embryo and placenta when there's an older father may also affect maternal health.</p><p>Dr. Anthony Vintzileos, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at NYU Winthrop Hospital in Mineola, N.Y., said the study may open the way for more research on how dad's age may play a role in pregnancy and child health.</p><p>But, he was quick to point out that the study cannot prove a cause-and-effect relationship, only an association.</p><p>And as for the connection to gestational diabetes, Vintzileos expressed concern that the researchers weren't able to adjust the data to control for the mother's weight. Maternal obesity is a risk factor for gestational diabetes.</p><p>Both Eisenberg and Vintzileos said these findings shouldn't lead anyone to change their family planning or life plans. They also both emphasized that it's too soon to make any changes in clinical practice based on this study. </p><p>The findings were published online Oct. 31 in the <i>BMJ</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Read more about older dads from the <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/getting-pregnant/expert-answers/paternal-age/faq-20057873\" target=\"_new\">Mayo Clinic</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 31, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Every year around Oct. 31, as horror films, haunted houses and pranksters in creepy costumes try their best to give you a fright, the question arises: Can a person literally be scared to death?</p> <p>The answer is a very conditional \"Yes.\" But, experts say, it's extraordinarily unlikely to happen from Halloween hijinks.</p> <p>\"Those circumstances are extremely rare when that happens,\" and pre-existing conditions are typically a factor, said Dr. Mark Estes, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.</p> <p>When a person is frightened or perceived to be in danger, the brain triggers a surge of adrenaline, which makes the heart beat faster and pushes the body instantly into \"fight-or-flight\" mode. It also affects the liver and pancreas, triggers perspiration and pushes blood toward major muscle groups.</p> <p>\"It's measured on how big the scare is,\" said Dr. Vincent Bufalino, a cardiologist and president of Advocate Medical Group in Downers Grove, Ill. He said the more dangerous adrenaline surges come from the body's response to a life-threatening situation or the stress of discovering the deceased body of a loved one.</p> <p>\"You can have a sudden cardiac-related event related to an adrenaline surge, but I think it would be a stretch to say you could get that from someone coming in a werewolf costume to your front door,\" he said. \"This is the kind of thing that you can't prepare for. If it happens, it happens, and you hope your body doesn't overreact to that event.\"</p> <p>People can typically get an adrenaline rush from skydiving or bungee jumping -- even while watching a horror flick from the couch. More dangerous adrenaline surges come from life-or-death moments such as getting out of the way of an oncoming car or fleeing a tornado.</p> <p>\"Swings of emotion and roller coasters are OK for people who are young, who have a healthy heart,\" Estes said. \"But certainly, in people with pre-existing risk factors or pre-existing cardiovascular disease, you want to reduce the environments in which you might be suddenly stressed like this.\"</p> <p>People are able to prepare themselves when they go to a haunted house or get on an amusement park ride, so their risk isn't the same as when they find themselves in life-threatening danger. </p> <p>\"The human mind and the human body do have the ability to prepare themselves for situations that can be anticipated that might be stressful and generally handle them much, much better,\" Estes said. \"It is the sudden, unexpected things which tend to cause a dramatic increase in heart rate and blood pressure and put people with pre-existing cardiovascular disease at risk.\"</p> <p>A possibly dangerous result of sudden stress may come from takotsubo cardiomyopathy, a weakening of the heart's main pumping chamber that is typically caused by emotional or physical stress. The temporary condition affects women significantly more than men.</p> <p>Also known as broken-heart syndrome, takotsubo cardiomyopathy is different from a heart attack in that arteries are not blocked but blood flow is negatively affected nonetheless.</p> <p>\"Adrenaline is a funny thing,\" Bufalino said. \"We can't measure it. The precipitating events are diverse. Your response to an event might be different than mine.\"</p> <p>Occasional rushes from adrenaline can be good for you, sometimes leading to increased cognitive function. But prolonged stress and an abundance of stress hormones over time can have negative effects, such as high blood pressure or anxiety.</p> <p>\"It's hard for us to be precise in saying, 'This event led to a certain amount of adrenaline that led to a cardiac event.' They're sporadic at best,\" Bufalino said.</p> <p>And there's little that can be done to prevent being frightened to death, he said, but being in good shape may help.</p> <p>\"Those folks who are used to dealing with adrenaline with exercise probably have a blunted response\" because their higher cardiovascular fitness level may allow their body to better handle an adrenaline surge, Bufalino said. \"I would speculate that aerobic exercise might be preventative or at least modify the body's response (to adrenaline).\"</p>",

Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said, \"Physical activity is about finding opportunities to add movement throughout the day as part of a bigger commitment to healthy living.\" </p><p> Being inactive causes 10 percent of early deaths in the United States, according to Giroir. If 25 percent of inactive people got at least the recommended 150 minutes of moderate  exercise a week, nearly 75,000 premature deaths could be prevented.</p><p>According to the new guidelines:</p><ul><li>A single bout of physical activity can sharpen your mind, reduce your anxiety, lower your blood pressure, improve your sleep and strengthen your body's ability to convert blood sugar into energy.</li><li>Regular physical activity can improve your brain health, reduce your risk of eight different forms of cancer, and lower your risk for excess weight gain.</li><li>Chronic health conditions improved by physical activity include osteoarthritis, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, anxiety and depression.</li></ul><p>The latest report was published Nov. 20 in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/index.htm?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fphysicalactivity%2Fbasics%2Fpa-health%2Findex.htm\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention </a> for more on physical activity.</p>",

He is a researcher at the University of Toronto's Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences.</p> <p>\"On Halloween, there is a 43 percent increased risk of a pedestrian death -- about four extra children are killed trick-or-treating,\" he said.</p><p>More boys than girls are killed, Redelmeier said. That's because boys often wear dark costumes -- \"pedestrian ninjas,\" he calls them.</p><p>The time when most deaths occurred was 6 p.m. That's when the really young kids are out and some folks are rushing home from work, he explained.</p><p>Children between the ages of 4 and 8 had the highest risk of being accidentally struck by a vehicle, the findings showed, and a lot more children are injured than killed.</p><p>\"Our study only looked at deaths,\" Redelmeier said. \"For every child who dies, there's probably one or two dozen children who are run over, survive, but are left with all sorts of disabilities.\"</p><p>But all these deaths and injuries could be prevented, he added.</p><p>Here's a few quick tips to follow:</p><ul><li>Look both ways before crossing the street.</li><li>Don't get distracted by your smartphone.</li><li>Instead of crisscrossing streets, go to houses on one side, and then the other -- so you're only crossing the street once.</li><li>Have reflectors or flashing lights on your kids' costumes. </li><li>Worry a lot more about road safety and a lot less about hidden dangers like razorblades in your child's candy bag. </li><li>Drivers need to slow down in residential neighborhoods.</li></ul><p>Dr. Barbara Pena, research director of the  emergency medicine department at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami, said she sees more injuries on Halloween. </p><p>\"We see big increases in trauma because all these kids are walking around in dark costumes at night,\" Pena said. \"We always have to stack the emergency department with extra people because we see a jump in injuries.\"</p><p>Pena also thinks that communities can help by closing streets so kids can trick-or-treat safely. In addition, parents need to keep a tight leash on their kids to prevent accidents and deaths. </p><p>Using data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Redelmeier and his colleagues looked at the number of pedestrian deaths on Oct. 31, from 1975 to 2016. They focused on the hours between 5 p.m. and midnight. </p><p>The investigators compared these deaths with those occurring during the same time period on Oct. 24 and Nov. 7.</p><p>Over 42 years, 608 pedestrians died on the 42 Halloween evenings, while 851 died on the 84 other evenings used for comparison.</p><p>The absolute death rates averaged 2.07 per hour on Halloween and 1.45 on other evenings, the researchers found. </p><p>The absolute risk of pedestrian deaths per 100 million Americans was small, Redelmeier's team noted. And that rate dropped from 5 to less than 3 deaths per 100 million Americans during the years between 1975 and  2016. </p><p>According to Maureen Vogel, a spokeswoman for the National Safety Council, \"There's no reason to keep kids from trick-or-treating. There's just more reason, in light of this study and others, to be aware of your surroundings and exercise caution.\"</p><p>The report was published online Oct. 30 in the journal <i>JAMA Pediatrics</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more Halloween safety tips, visit the <a href=\"https://www.nsc.org/home-safety/tools-resources/seasonal-safety/autumn/halloween\" target=\"_new\">National Safety Council</a>.</p>",

Movements are similar to those used in downhill skiing, basketball and even tennis. So it's a great way to train for those sports, but almost anyone can benefit.</p><p>One caveat though: plyometrics is a type of exercise that isn't for people who are currently out of shape or have orthopedic issues.</p><p>Plyometrics uses simple exercises like hops and jumps that alter your muscles' cycle of lengthening and shortening to increase their power. Jumps should always begin from ground level, from and onto cushioned surfaces for both ease and safety. Jumping on and off a low box or over cones or foam barriers are all simple options.</p><p>Low-impact landings are key. Land from toe to heel, use the entire length of your feet as rockers to help disperse the force of the landing, and keep knees from swaying to better distribute that force through the muscles that protect these joints. The experts at the American Council on Exercise suggest visualization to lighten your landings: Picture yourself landing like a feather or springing back easily like a coil.</p><p>Under the right supervision, youngsters and teens can benefit from plyometrics training, according to the American College of Sports Medicine. It may help strengthen bones, keep kids at a healthy weight, and decrease sports-related injuries, especially for girls who are at higher risk than boys. Common childhood pastimes like hopscotch, jumping rope and jumping jacks are actually all examples of plyometrics.</p><p>Because of its explosive nature and very specific movements, instruction makes sense at every age. Also, as with strength training, allow 48 to 72 hours between sessions to give muscles time to recover.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Council on Exercise has more on how to use <a href=\"https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/lifestyle/blog/6692/plyometrics-controlled-impact-maximum-power\" target=\"_new\">plyometrics</a> safely.</p>",

Try to place items in a few smaller bags instead of one large one. When lifting luggage, stand alongside it and bend at the knees, lifting the luggage with your leg muscles. Once lifted, hold luggage close to your body.</p><p>Don't twist when lifting and carrying luggage. Point your toes in the direction you're going and turn your entire body in that direction. Don't carry bulky luggage for long periods of time. When possible, use the airline's baggage service when you have heavy luggage.</p><p>Carry luggage in both hands, rather than one hand off to the side. This can decrease stress to the spine and reduce the risk of developing elbow problems.</p><p>Carry, don't drag, rolling luggage when climbing stairs.</p><p>If you're using a backpack, it should have two padded and adjustable shoulder straps to equally balance the weight. Pack heavier items low and towards the center.</p><p>When using a duffel or shoulder bag, switch sides often.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/family/holiday/\" target=\"_new\">holiday health and safety</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 31, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Long belittled as inconsequential, the appendix is hardly the rock star of body organs. But its reputation may get a boost from new research that suggests that removing it may lower the risk for Parkinson's disease.</p><p>The finding follows an analysis that examined how appendix removal surgery (appendectomy) affected Parkinson's risk among 1.6 million Swedish residents.</p><p>The study couldn't prove cause and effect, but it found that appendectomy lowered Parkinson's risk by roughly 20 percent.</p><p>\"This is a tissue that most people consider to be a useless organ. It's attached to the large intestine, and it's removed as a very common surgical practice,\" said study author Viviane Labrie. She's a neuroscientist with the Center for Neurodegenerative Science at the Van Andel Research Institute in Grand Rapids, Mich.</p><p>The new findings suggest, \"that the appendix may be a tissue site that plays a role in the initiation of Parkinson's disease,\" she said.</p><p>Why? \"The hallmark pathology of Parkinson's disease in the brain is Lewy bodies, which is characterized by a clumped form of a protein called alpha-synuclein,\" Labrie explained.</p><p>What's more, clumps of this protein are found in the intestinal tract and are \"present in the appendixes of all of us,\" sometimes years before Parkinson's symptoms arise, she said.</p><p>So, \"we think that if in rare events [such protein clumps] were to escape the appendix and enter the brain, this could lead to Parkinson's disease.\" How? Simply by traveling up the nerve that connects the intestinal tract directly to the brain, Labrie said.</p><p>Parkinson's attacks the nervous system and results in a progressive loss of both motor function and many non-motor functions.</p><p>Common among the complications of Parkinson's is the onset of gastrointestinal dysfunction -- including constipation -- which can actually precede mobility loss by as much as 20 years. This signaled a potential link between Parkinson's onset and the appendix, the researchers explained.</p><p>To investigate, researchers pored over data previously collected by the Swedish National Patient Registry. The registry is unique because since 1964 it has maintained a full record of diagnoses and surgeries for a huge swath of the Swedish patient pool.</p><p>Of the 1.6 million covered patients, more than 550,000 had undergone an appendectomy.</p><p>After following Parkinson's incidence for up to 52 years post-surgery, investigators found that Parkinson's was ultimately diagnosed in 1.2 out of every 1,000 appendectomy patients, compared to a risk of 1.4 out of every 1,000 people in the general Swedish population.</p> <p>That meant that Parkinson's risk had dropped by 19.3 percent among those who had had their appendix removed.</p><p>What's more, after honing in on the specific experiences of about 850 Parkinson's patients, the researchers determined that appendix removal was also associated with a 3.6-year delay in the onset of Parkinson's among those who had the surgery and still developed the disease.</p><p>Still, Labrie stressed that \"we are not saying that having an appendix causes Parkinson's disease, and that all people should go out and remove their appendix.\"</p><p>Rather, \"we think that what actually distinguishes a person that goes on to develop Parkinson's from one that does not is not the presence of this pathology, but rather the factors that trigger departure from the appendix.\" That raises the prospect for developing new therapies designed to prevent such protein clumps from escaping the appendix.</p><p>The findings were published in the Oct. 31 issue of <i>Science Translational Medicine</i>.</p><p>Dr. Rachel Dolhun is vice president of medical communications for the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. She described the link between Parkinson's and the appendix as \"particularly interesting.\"</p><p>\"But it's important to stress these are associations and do not establish causation,\" she said. \"In other words, having an appendectomy will not definitely decrease [the] risk of Parkinson's.\"</p><p> Dolhun added, \"Investigating the association between the gut and brain further could potentially lead to deeper understandings of the causes of Parkinson's, as well as how Parkinson's starts and progresses, and how to intervene to stop it. But much work remains to be done.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more  on  Parkinson's disease at <a href=\"https://www.michaeljfox.org/understanding-parkinsons/i-have-got-what.php\" target=\"_new\">The Michael J.

What I worry about is that it gets so hyped up,\" she told the <i>AP</i>.</p><p>Some studies suggest that ketamine is most effective and generally safe in giving short-term relief for patients who don't respond to antidepressants, or about one-third of the 300 million people with depression worldwide.</p><p>Ketamine has \"truly has revolutionized the field,\" Dr. Gerard Sanacora, a Yale University psychiatrist, told the <i>AP</i>.</p><p>The drug has altered scientists' views on how depression affects the brain and showed that quick relief is possible, according to Sanacora, who has done research for or consulted with companies trying to develop ketamine-based drugs.</p><p>However, much more research is needed before ketamine might become a standard depression treatment, Sanacora noted.</p><p>Last year, he co-authored an American Psychiatric Association task force review of ketamine treatment for mood disorders.

In fact, the study team found that 70 percent of the Down syndrome patients who died during the 5.5-year study period had dementia.</p><p>And \"we found that people who had two or more other health conditions developed dementia earlier,\" Hithersay added. \"So it is vital that common health conditions are given appropriate attention and treatment in these older adults.\"</p><p>Fifty years ago, life expectancy was typically just 10 years among Down syndrome patients, the researchers said. Often, deaths occurred within the first year, as a consequence of congenital heart defects.</p><p>But better care has extended average life expectancy to nearly 64, with respiratory illness the main cause of death.</p><p>But longer life expectancy has yielded a new problem: early onset dementia.</p><p>\"People with Down syndrome are at increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease dementia at a younger age, approximately 20 years earlier in life, as compared to the general population,\" noted Hithersay.</p><p>Investigators peg the average age of dementia onset at 55, with upwards of nearly 90 percent of patients receiving a dementia diagnosis by the time they hit 65.</p><p>But to what degree premature death among Down syndrome patients is directly linked to early onset dementia has remained an open question.</p><p>To explore the issue, investigators tracked 211 British Down syndrome patients. All were 36 years old and up, and nearly a third were diagnosed with dementia prior to the study's launch, at an average age of almost 52.</p><p>By the study's conclusion, 27 patients had died. Of these, 19 had dementia. Investigators determined that those with dementia were five times more likely to die early than those without dementia.</p><p>Among those who died seemingly dementia-free, epilepsy appeared to be the only \"significant factor\" implicated. The team theorized that some of them may in fact have struggled with undiagnosed dementia.</p><p>The findings were published online Nov. 19 in the journal <i>JAMA Neurology</i>.</p><p>Dr. Michael Rafii is medical director of the Alzheimer's Therapeutic Research Institute at the Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California in San Diego. He wrote an editorial that accompanied the study.</p><p>\"The findings from this study highlight the urgent need for research into treatments to prevent or delay\" Alzheimer's in Down syndrome patients, Rafii said.</p><p>\"With advances in medical care and improvements in the overall health of individuals with [Down syndrome], life expectancy has increased dramatically,\" Rafii noted. \"However, along with this longer life span comes the prospect of an increased risk for of developing dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.\"</p><p>But, \"although most people with Down syndrome will experience brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease as they age, not everyone will develop dementia, and it is not inevitable for all,\" Rafii stressed. \"This is an important phenomenon and needs much further study.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Child Health and Human Development has more on <a href=\"https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/downsyndrome\" target=\"_new\"> Down syndrome</a>.</p>",

Although no one has died, illnesses have been so severe that in 13 cases patients had to be hospitalized, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday.</p><p>So who's most at risk from E. coli?</p><p>Dr. Robert Glatter is an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City who's seen the effects of infection with the gastrointestinal bug firsthand. It's not a minor ailment, he said.</p><p>\"In general, symptoms of E. coli infection generally begin about three to four days after consuming the bacteria, and may include abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and watery or bloody diarrhea, along with fever,\" Glatter said.</p><p>And while healthy people who battle a bout of E. coli typically recover within five to seven days, the illness can be more protracted -- and even deadly -- for people already made vulnerable by chronic disease or advanced age.</p><p>\"People with diabetes, kidney disease or those with cancer or autoimmune disease run the risk of a more severe illness,\" Glatter explained.</p><p>The particular strain of E. coli detected in the current lettuce outbreak -- E. coli O157:H7 -- is particularly nasty, he noted.</p><p>\"Most strains of E. coli do not actually cause diarrhea, but E. coli O157 produces a powerful toxin that injures the inner lining of the small intestine, leading to bloody diarrhea,\" Glatter said. Even a tiny amount of ingested bacteria could spur this type of illness.</p><p>\"It can make people much more ill, and may lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure, in some cases,\" he said.</p><p>Indeed, the CDC has reported one such case already in the latest outbreak.</p><p>In many cases, antibiotics are used to help beat back an E. coli infection, but these drugs can affect the kidneys, Glatter noted.</p><p>\"Antibiotics may be necessary in certain cases, so it's important to see your doctor if you have continued and severe symptoms such as fever, bloody diarrhea, and you are not able to eat or drink,\" he said.</p><p>However, in the case of E. coli O157:H7, \"taking antibiotics may actually increase your risk of developing kidney failure, so it's important to speak with your health care provider if you should develop severe symptoms,\" Glatter advised.</p><p>And if you do think you might be sick with E. coli, or any other foodborne illness, make sure you don't spread it to those near you.</p><p>The bacterium \"can be transmitted person-to-person, so it's vital that anyone who is potentially infected wash their hands thoroughly and not share utensils, cups or glasses,\" Glatter said. \"This also goes for bath towels. Linens also need to be washed in hot water and treated with bleach.\"</p><p>He noted that \"ground beef, unpasteurized milk, fresh produce, and contaminated water are common sources of E. coli bacteria.\"</p><p>As for the current outbreak, cases have so far been reported in California (10 cases), Connecticut (1 case), Illinois (2 cases), Massachusetts (2 cases), Maryland (1 case), Michigan (7 cases), New Hampshire (2 cases), New Jersey (3 cases), New York (2 cases), Ohio (1 case) and Wisconsin (1 case).</p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration noted that romaine lettuce typically has a shelf life of about 21 days, so contaminated produce could still be on store shelves or in people's refrigerators. For that reason, \"consumers throughout the U.S. should not eat romaine lettuce until further notice,\" the agency advised.</p><p>The exact source of the outbreak remains unclear, but tests are being done on romaine lettuce throughout the U.S. market.</p><p>\"The quick and aggressive steps we're taking today are aimed at making sure we get ahead of this emerging outbreak, to reduce risk to consumers, and to help people protect themselves and their families from this foodborne illness outbreak,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in an agency news release on Tuesday. \"This is especially important ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, when people will be sitting down for family meals.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Find out more about E. coli illness at the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/ecoli-symptoms.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

He's a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, in New York City.</p><p>For the study, Olfson and his colleagues analyzed data from nearly 140,000 U.S. adults who took part in a regular federal health survey between 2004 and 2015.</p><p>The number of people with serious psychological distress declined from 4.8 percent to 3.7 percent during that period, the survey results showed.</p><p>That's good news, given increases in opioid overdoses, suicide rates and other indications of a very distraught America, Olfson said.</p><p>\"Against that background, I think this is a welcome trend that cuts against a common impression that there's been this increase overall in distress within the United States,\" he added.</p><p>The overall percentage of Americans using any outpatient mental health care grew from 19 percent to 23 percent at that same time, the findings showed.</p><p>However, the people receiving help aren't necessarily those who need it the most.</p><p>The proportion of seriously distressed people who received outpatient mental health care rose from 54 percent to 68 percent. \"That means you also have a third or so who aren't receiving any mental health care,\" Olfson said.</p><p>At the same time, the proportion of people with little or no distress nonetheless receiving mental health care rose from 17 percent to 21 percent.</p><p>Prescriptions for antidepressants and other psychiatric drugs also are increasing, from 50 percent to 64 percent among those with serious distress, and 15 to 19 percent for those with little or no distress, according to the report.</p><p>But fewer than 5 percent of the tens of thousands of people surveyed had serious distress. That means those who are in real need account for a significantly smaller portion of the overall increase in mental health care, the researchers said.</p><p>The findings were published online recently in the journal <i>JAMA Psychiatry</i>.</p><p>These results jibe with research going back decades with the American health care system, said Keith Humphreys, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University.</p><p>Much of the U.S. market for mental health care is cash-based, involving people seeking self-improvement, self-understanding or the means to cope with minor anxieties, Humphreys said.</p><p>\"A lot of it comes out of people just buying it themselves, like they might have an exercise coach or something,\" he added. \"That's fine, but those problems are nothing compared to having schizophrenia and being on a street corner shivering and thinking the CIA is chasing you. We've always had much more trouble getting that much more severe group what they need.\"</p><p>But Olfson said there are reasons beyond money why distressed people aren't getting the care they need.</p><p>The stigma against seeking mental health care might dissuade people from reaching out, he suggested. Their disorder also might get in the way of seeking help; for example, a depressed person might be so demoralized that he or she feels therapy wouldn't benefit them.</p><p>The United States is also contending with an ongoing shortage of mental health professionals, Olfson pointed out.</p><p>\"There are lots of places in the United States, particularly in rural and remote regions, where there are very few mental health providers,\" Olfson said.</p><p>The current situation might be somewhat better than shown in this study. Humphreys noted that the last survey period ended in 2015, just as the Affordable Care Act began drastically expanding insurance coverage in the United States.</p><p>\"The study stops right as we dramatically expand mental health coverage, including to lower-income people,\" Humphreys said. \"There's reason to be optimistic and think in the future this will be different.\"</p><p>Olfson suggested one means of expanding mental health treatment is to train and empower primary care doctors to serve as front-line providers.</p><p>\"Most Americans in the course of a year make at least one visit to their primary care doc,\" he said. \"They may be a point of entry that's underutilized for people that have serious psychological distress.\"</p><p>But there's a downside to relying on family doctors to fill the gap in mental health care, said Dr. Robert Trestman, chair of psychiatry and behavioral medicine for Carilion Clinic in Roanoke, Va.</p><p>\"When things are at a mild level of problematic distress, the best treatment would be psychotherapy, not medication,\" Trestman said. \"But there was a significant increase in the use of medication in those with less distress.\"</p><p>Trestman suspects that primary care clinicians faced with mentally distressed patients are resorting to the prescription pad rather than referring them for therapy.</p><p>\"They will frequently offer a prescription for an antidepressant, where psychotherapy might have been healthier for the individual,\" Trestman said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db203.htm\" target=\"_new\">serious psychological distress</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 31, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Surgeons have long turned to a minimally invasive means of hysterectomy when treating early stage cervical cancer.</p><p>However, two new studies could change all that. Both found the approach was linked to a higher rate of cancer recurrence, plus worse long-term   survival, compared to more \"open\" surgeries.</p><p>\"Minimally invasive surgery was adopted as an alternative to open radical hysterectomy before high-quality evidence regarding its impact on survival was available,\" said Dr. Jose Alejandro Rauh-Hain of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who helped lead the study.</p><p>Speaking in a university news release, Rauh-Hain said he was \"surprised\" to find that the technique \"negatively affected oncologic outcomes for women with early stage cervical cancer.\"</p><p>Dr. Alexander Melamed, a gynecologic oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston, was co-lead researcher on the study with Ruah-Hain. He noted that a second study --  this time an international clinical trial -- has found similar results.</p><p>Taken together, the data should change clinical practice, Melamed said in an MGH news release.</p><p>\"Personally, I will not offer minimally invasive radical hysterectomy to patients who come to me for cervical cancer treatment, until compelling new research demonstrates a minimally invasive approach that does not carry these risks,\" he said.</p><p>Both studies were published online Oct. 31 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>Robots and laparoscopy</b></p><p>Each year, over 13,000 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed in the United States, and nearly 4,200 women will die of the disease, according to the American Cancer Society. Radical (complete) hysterectomy is standard treatment.</p><p>As the researchers explained, oncologic surgeons largely abandoned \"open\" surgeries for radical hysterectomy years ago with the advent of small-incision, laparoscopic techniques.</p><p>The use of robot-assisted surgery only accelerated the move away from traditional \"open\" operations.</p><p>Initial studies appeared to support the use of the minimally invasive techniques. However, patient follow-up times in those trials were relatively short. The two new studies were different,  tracking outcomes for more than four years after surgery.</p><p>In the study led by Ruah-Hain and Melamed, researchers assessed outcomes for nearly 2,500 patients in the U.S. National Cancer Database who underwent radical hysterectomy for early stage cervical cancer from 2010 through 2013.</p><p>Of those, about half had minimally invasive surgery and about half had open surgery.</p><p>In the four years after their procedures, 94 patients in the minimally invasive group died from any cause, compared with 70 patients in the open surgery group. That works out to a 9 percent risk of death in the minimally invasive group and a 5 percent risk in the open surgery group -- a significant difference, the study authors said.</p><p>The investigators also analyzed data from a second U.S. health database, called Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER). That analysis showed that four-year post-op survival rates were stable before 2006,  when minimally invasive radical hysterectomy began to be widely used to treat early stage cervical cancer.</p><p>But <i>after</i> 2006, survival rates began to fall by about 0.8 percent per year, the team reported. That suggests a true cause-and-effect relationship.</p><p>\"This result is very surprising, since randomized trials have demonstrated the safety of minimally invasive surgery for uterine, gastric and colorectal cancers,\" Melamed said.</p><p>\"Our own work using similar methods to investigate minimally invasive surgery for ovarian cancer found no association with increased mortality, so it seems clear that something very different may be going on in cervical cancer,\" he added.</p><p><b>More surprises</b></p><p>The second study published in <i>NEJM</i> was a clinical trial led by Dr. Pedro Ramirez, also of the Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. He said that long patient follow-up was key.</p><p>\"Until now, data [has] focused primarily on surgical outcomes and the immediate period after, such as the recovery of the patient, length of stay, transfusion needs, and overall return to functional daily activities,\" Ramirez explained.</p><p>His team's study was \"the first to prospectively compare the two surgical approaches and evaluate oncologic [cancer] outcomes, including disease-free and overall survival and recurrence rates,\" Ramirez explained in the cancer center news release.</p><p>The trial involved 631 patients with early stage cervical cancer treated at 33 medical centers worldwide.  Again, women were randomly selected to receive minimally invasive or open radical hysterectomies.</p><p>Then came the surprising result:  Women who got the minimally invasive technique had triple the odds of disease progression over the next 4.5 years, compared with standard surgery, the team found.</p><p>And while 96.5 percent of patients who got open surgery were still alive without any signs of cervical cancer more than four years later, the same was true for only 86 percent of women who'd undergone the minimally invasive approach.</p><p>The results were so striking that the study was cut short in 2017 to safeguard patients.</p><p>The research \"reinforces the need for more randomized clinical trials in the field of surgery,\" Ramirez said.</p><p>Melamed added that \"it's important to note that our study doesn't explain why [the risk of death] is higher among women who have minimally invasive surgery.\"</p><p>He speculated that  \"there could be something technical about minimally invasive radical hysterectomy that is different from the open procedure and makes a difference for long-term survival. An alternative explanation is that U.S. surgeons could have been less experienced with the minimally invasive procedure than with open surgery during the study period.\"</p><p><b>Patient-doctor discussions</b></p><p>Melamed said patients can still opt for the minimally invasive approach,  but only after considering the new data.</p><p>\"Surgeons who wish to offer minimally invasive radical hysterectomy to cervical cancer patients must ensure they are informed of these risks,\" Melamed said.</p><p>Dr. Ioannis Alagkiozidis directs gynecologic oncology at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City. He wasn't involved in the studies, but agreed they could change clinical practice.</p><p>Minimally invasive hysterectomy was introduced because it led to \"decreased hospital stays and blood loss, decreased pain and faster recovery,\" Alagkiozidis explained.</p><p>But now, \"given the burden of published evidence, minimally invasive surgery cannot be considered as the standard of care for patients with early cervical cancer,\" he said.</p><p>Further research might still support a role for the approach, however.  Alagkiozidis noted that most of the minimally invasive operations included in the studies did not include robotic technologies.</p><p> \"Well-designed studies comparing robot-assisted laparoscopic to conventional laparoscopic and open procedures are needed,\" he said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/types/cervical/patient/cervical-treatment-pdq\" target=\"_new\">cervical cancer treatment</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 19, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Almost 8 percent of American children have food allergies, and 1 in 5 of those kids suffers an allergic reaction severe enough to wind up in the hospital, a new study finds. </p><p>\"Childhood food allergies are relatively common and should be taken seriously, with 1 in 5 having a reaction that takes them to the emergency room every year,\" said lead researcher Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.</p><p>The most common allergies are to peanuts, milk, shellfish, tree nuts, egg, fish, wheat, soy and sesame, Gupta said.</p><p>Peanut is the most common food allergy, affecting about 2 million children, followed by milk (1 million), shellfish (1 million), tree nuts (1 million), eggs (nearly 1 million), fish (less than a half million), wheat and soy (.4 million) and sesame (.15 million), she said.</p><p>Among children allergic to sesame, at least 1 in 3 had a reaction severe enough to visit the emergency room in the past year, Gupta said. </p><p>Senior author Dr. Kari Nadeau, director of the Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research at Stanford University in California, said food allergies are on the rise because children are not exposed to a variety of foods at a young age. </p><p>People live a cleaner life, she said. \"We are not exposed to the farm, animals and dirt. We know that if you have a dog at home during the first year of life, it protects you against allergies,\" Nadeau said. </p><p>Another way to prevent food allergies is to expose children early to the foods that cause most of them, she said.</p><p>\"Exposing children to these food late has actually caused an increase in food allergies, Nadeau said.  </p><p>In addition, adequate amounts of vitamin D and preventing dry skin are also important in reducing the odds of developing a food allergy, she said. </p><p>Prevention is the only treatment available, Nadeau said. That means avoiding the foods one is allergic to, but that can be a challenge. </p><p>It's often hard to tell if a prepared food contains possible allergens. Although food packaging is often labeled, the law in the United States doesn't require that sesame appear on a list of ingredients, as it must in Canada, Europe, Australia and Israel, Nadeau said. </p><p>For example, a 15-year-old girl who was allergic to sesame died in June after eating a sandwich on a baguette that contained sesame, but was not labeled as such, Nadeau said. </p><p>In the study, Gupta, Nadeau and colleagues asked nearly 40,000 parents if their children had food allergies. Specifically, the researchers asked if the children had a suspected food allergy, if it was diagnosed by a doctor, what were the symptoms of the allergic reaction and how it was treated.</p><p>The research team also found that 41 percent of kids with food allergies had a prescription for an epinephrine auto-injector, such as EpiPen. </p><p>The most severe allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis, which causes the airway to swell, making it hard or impossible to breathe. Injecting epinephrine rapidly reduces swelling and opens the airway. Epinephrine can save the life of someone having an allergic reaction, which is why people who are at risk for allergic reactions are encouraged to carry the drug with them at all times.</p><p>\"Parents who suspect that their child has a food allergy should consult a physician for testing so that foods are not unnecessarily avoided and that, if an allergy is confirmed, an epinephrine auto-injector can be prescribed for emergency treatment,\" Gupta said.</p><p>In addition to more kids having food allergies, many don't outgrow them, Nadeau said. \"It does not look like food allergies are getting better, and it does not look like they're getting less,\" she said.</p><p>\"It's starting to look like those who have food allergies in childhood will have them in adulthood,\" Nadeau said.</p><p>Dr. Vivian Hernandez-Trujillo, medical director of the division of allergy and immunology at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami, said, \"This important article highlights the public health epidemic that we have with food allergies.\" She was not part of the study.</p><p>Hernandez-Trujillo hopes that the recent changes in the recommendation about when infants should be introduced to solid food, which call for an earlier introduction, will turn the tide and stop the increase, but that will take years.</p><p>The report was published online Nov. 19 in the journal <i>Pediatrics </i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology for more on <a href=\"https://acaai.org/allergies/types/food-allergy\" target=\"_new\">food allergies</a>.</p>",

That's a disorienting side effect that makes it hard for patients to work their prosthetic limbs properly.</p><p>This August -- a little more than two years after his amputation -- Ewing successfully tackled the Lotus Flower Tower, a renowned 8,430-foot peak located in the Northwest Territories of Canada.</p><p>\"When I'm connected to the robotic ankle, I can use it as if it's my very own,\" said Ewing, 54, of Falmouth, Maine. \"It's a very natural transition going from no foot to all of a sudden having my foot back. I don't have to retrain my brain or retrain my muscles to do anything. It's pretty much a one-for-one replacement.\"</p><p>Losing a limb causes many disconcerting effects, as the brain tries to interpret signals from an arm or leg that's no longer there.</p><p>One of the oddest might be the fact that not only do people feel as though they have a phantom limb, but that limb's position in their mind often doesn't match the location of their prosthetic replacement.</p><p>\"They can perceive a foot that is somewhere in space, but oftentimes is disembodied,\" said lead researcher Dr. Matthew Carty, director of the Lower Extremity Transplant Program at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. \"It doesn't map geographically to where their prosthetic foot is. It's kind of floating to the side, or they may feel it's encased in a hard block and they can't move it.\"</p><p>These misleading signals can make it difficult for amputees to learn how to work a prosthetic limb properly.</p><p><b>New surgery erases disconnect with prosthetic limb</b></p><p>In July 2016, Ewing became the first person to undergo an amputation procedure designed to eliminate this disconnect.</p><p>Named after him, the Ewing Amputation recreates the normal tug-and-stretch relationship of muscles that occurs during normal movement of legs or arms.</p><p>When you move a limb, muscles on one side contract while muscles on the other side stretch, Carty explained. For example, when you lift a foot off the ground and move your ankle around, you'll feel muscles on both sides of your leg moving back and forth.</p><p>Researchers have learned that as they work, the muscles are sending constant signals to the brain's proprioceptive sensory system. Proprioception is your ability to know the exact position of your limbs at all times, allowing you to precisely coordinate their movements.</p><p>\"It transmits information back to our brain where the limb is in space without us having to look at it,\" Carty said.</p><p>Traditional amputation screws up these signals by decoupling the muscles, Carty said. The lack of push-and-pull muscle feedback confuses the brain, creating misleading perceptions of a disembodied phantom limb.</p><p>A Ewing Amputation recreates the push/pull dynamic by surgically connecting muscles that normally operate in pairs, forcing one muscle to stretch in response to the other muscle contracting.</p><p>Fed the normal muscle signals, the brain is better able to make a person's perception of their lost limb line up with their new prosthetic, Carty said.</p><p>\"The phantom limb the patient perceives maps geographically over their prosthetic device,\" Carty said. \"When they think about moving their phantom limb, their brain superimposes that phantom limb over the prosthetic limb.\"</p><p>Amputees also often feel sensations of itching or pain associated with their phantom limb, as the brain struggles to make sense of discordant signals. The Ewing Amputation appears to prevent those sensations, the researchers added.</p><p><b>Success with procedure grows</b></p><p>Since Ewing, doctors have performed this amputation procedure on 11 more patients, Carty said. Ten lost their leg below the knee, and one lost their leg above the knee.</p><p>\"At this point, we have enough data to say we think we've figured out a better way to do amputations, and we're in the process of testing that in a variety of different clinical scenarios,\" Carty said.</p><p>The research team has received funding to develop the procedure for arm amputation as well, Carty added.</p><p>Ewing had his climbing accident in December 2014, and at first, the damage to his left ankle was the least of his worries. He had life-threatening injuries throughout his body that required emergency treatment.</p><p>However, the ankle failed to heal properly during two years of recovery, remaining painful and swollen, Ewing said. A CT scan revealed that most of the bone in the ankle had died.</p><p>\"It was not going to heal and recover,\" Ewing said. \"It was not likely I would ever regain use of the foot, so I opted to have it amputated.\"</p><p>Carty had been working with a team at MIT to create a robotic limb that would work in conjunction with the new transplant procedure his team had dreamed up. It just so happened that a friend of Ewing is a lead researcher at MIT, who put him in contact with Carty.</p><p><b>But special surgery not for every amputee</b></p><p>This sequence of events points out one drawback to the new procedure, said Dr. Ageliki Vouyouka, an associate professor of surgery and radiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.</p><p>The procedure uses tissue harvested from the amputated limb to create the new connections between muscle groups, Vouyouka noted. Given this, people who lose limbs damaged by gangrene, poor blood flow or other diseases that kill off tissue would likely not be good candidates for the Ewing Amputation.</p><p>But the new procedure is a \"very interesting development\" that is likely to become a new standard for amputation if further testing bears it out, said Vouyouka, who was not involved with the research.</p><p>\"Mostly I can see that happening for limbs lost to war trauma or civilian trauma,\" she said.</p><p>The new amputation procedure has provided other benefits on top of easier adaptation to his prosthetic foot, Ewing said.</p><p>\"The muscle definition is much stronger. There's much more tissue there. My leg hasn't atrophied away to skin and bones, which happens quite a lot with amputations,\" Ewing said. </p><p>\"The thinking is the residual limb is healthier because there's all this active muscle tissue there. You have improved circulation, more muscle tissue for padding and all of that,\" he said.</p><p>The study on Ewing's case was published recently in the online journal <i>PRS Global Open</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Mayo Clinic has more about <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/phantom-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20376272?p=1\" target=\"_new\">phantom pain</a>.</p>",

In addition to its fluid exercises, called asanas or poses, it focuses on correct breathing, posture and meditation with a philosophy that strives for a balance of body, mind and spirit.</p><p>There are many styles of yoga offered in the United States, most of which are rooted in the classic hatha yoga.</p><p>Popular hatha yoga styles include: Ananda, Anusara, Ashtanga, Bikram,  Iyengar, Kripalu, Kundalini and Viniyoga.</p><p>Not every style is right for every <i>body</i>.</p><p>For instance Bikram, or \"hot yoga,\" is done in a room heated to 105 degrees Fahrenheit to encourage heavy sweating. This can raise your own body temperature well over 100 degrees F, and that's not safe for everyone. There's also been some criticism about not enough water breaks being offered during sessions at some studios. Because of its excessive heat exposure, Bikram yoga may not be appropriate for people with heart or lung disease, or who have experienced heatstroke in the past.</p><p>Fortunately, there are many other interesting styles to explore.</p><p>For instance, Iyengar (pronounced eye-n-gar) yoga incorporates props into poses and focuses on symmetry and body alignment. Viniyoga (pronounced vee-knee-yoga) is a very gentle style, often recommended for beginners and when yoga is used as a healing therapy. Sivananda (pronounced siva-nanda) also focuses on gentle movement along with an emphasis on deep relaxation.</p><p>At the other extreme, Kundalini (pronounced kun-doo-lini) is designed to release a flow of energy through breathing and chanting.</p><p>These are just a few of the options. Be sure to ask questions as you investigate yoga classes and studios so you know where the emphasis is placed and that your personal goals will be met.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The magazine <i>Yoga Journal</i> has an online tool to help you locate information on <a href=\"https://directory.yogajournal.com\" target=\"_new\">yoga teachers</a>, trained in various types of yoga, across the country.</p>",

In fact, it has disappeared from the spotlight in more recent years, as rates dipped after the 1990s and the opioid epidemic increasingly captured headlines.</p><p>However, inhalant abuse remains common: A U.S. survey found that in 2017, close to 9 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds had ever tried to get high from common products such as cleaners, spray paint, glue, felt-tip markers or lighter fluid.</p><p>\"Inhalant abuse has fallen off the radar a bit, but it's still common,\" said Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor, a medical toxicologist with the nonprofit National Capital Poison Center in Washington, D.C.</p><p>It's particularly appealing to kids because they can easily get their hands on household products, noted Johnson-Arbor, who was not involved in the new case report.</p><p>Beyond that, she said, kids may assume the seemingly benign products can't hurt them.</p><p>But this teenager's death illustrates just how misguided those perceptions are, Johnson-Arbor said.</p><p>The report, published Nov. 15 in the journal <i>BMJ Case Reports</i>, centers on a 19-year-old Dutch man who was in a rehab center for ketamine and marijuana abuse.</p><p>Without any drugs available, he reached for a personal care product -- spray deodorant -- in a quest to get high. He initially became hyper, \"jumping up and down,\" according to the report, before collapsing.</p><p>Nurses at the center performed basic life support, and when paramedics arrived they discovered the man was in cardiac arrest. That means the heart has stopped and is no longer pumping blood to the rest of the body. Paramedics used a portable defibrillator to try to \"shock\" his heart back into a normal rhythm, but could not revive him.</p><p>When the patient was taken to the hospital, doctors placed him in a medically induced coma. But when his condition failed to improve after more than a week, further treatment was deemed futile. He was taken off life support and died shortly after.</p><p>Like many aerosol products, spray deodorant typically contains butane as a gas propellant, according to Dr. Kelvin Harvey Kramp, one of the doctors on the case.</p><p>Butane and similar substances are readily absorbed into fat tissue, including nervous system tissue. That action can produce the \"high\" inhalant abusers are looking for -- but it can also have severe consequences for the heart and other vital organs, according to Kramp.</p><p>At this point, there have been many reports on inhalant-linked deaths, said Kramp, of Maastad Hospital in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.</p><p>But, he said, one hope with this report is to raise awareness that people in drug rehab may be especially vulnerable to this type of substance abuse.</p><p>Another, Kramp said, is to warn young people about the dangers of inhalants in general.</p><p>There are immediate risks other than cardiac arrest, Johnson-Arbor noted: For one, the intoxication can lead to serious or fatal accidents.</p><p>According to Kramp, some deaths have been blamed on suffocation, when victims used a plastic bag to inhale the chemical fumes.</p><p>Chronic inhalant abuse can also have lasting consequences, Johnson-Arbor said. Over time, it may damage the brain or peripheral nerves in the limbs, for example.</p><p>It can be tough for parents to spot inhalant abuse, according to Johnson-Arbor. Even if your child swipes your spray deodorant, she noted, he or she may simply be using it as intended.</p><p>That said, Johnson-Arbor pointed to some potential red flags parents can look for: a rash around the mouth where the chemical has irritated the skin; chemical smells from a child's clothes or breath; or large amounts of household products gone missing.</p><p>Johnson-Arbor suggested that parents try to head off any experimentation by talking to their kids about the dangers of huffing.</p><p>\"If you don't discuss this with them, they'll hear about it at school or at summer camp,\" she said. \"It's better to arm your child with knowledge.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse has more on <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/inhalants/what-are-inhalants\" target=\"_new\">inhalant abuse</a>.</p>",

According to wide-ranging research, garlic seems to improve immunity and heart health, help fight certain cancers, and lower triglycerides and total cholesterol.</p><p>Some of these benefits can be seen after eating just one meal with raw garlic. Yet overall there's enough evidence to have at least half a clove every day, researchers suggest.</p><p>Garlic is readily available and relatively inexpensive. Buy one whole head of garlic at a time -- the skin should be dry and papery and the visible bulbs should be firm and full, not shriveled.</p><p>To get the most benefits, chop, slice or crush fresh garlic to use it. This fires up a process that makes its compounds more potent. Wait 5 to 10 minutes before eating or adding to a dish, especially if you'll be mixing it with a highly acidic food like lemon juice.</p><p>Some easy ways to use minced raw garlic are to blend it into avocado, along with red onion, jalapeno and cilantro for guacamole; into chickpeas for hummus; or into cooked white beans for bean dip. Whisked into oil and vinegar with your choice of herbs, garlic adds zest to salad dressings and marinades.</p><p>But you don't have to always eat it raw. As long as the garlic is prepped as suggested and added toward the end of a recipe, it will retain its nutritional value when cooked.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about <a href=\"http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/food-beverages/garlic\" target=\"_new\">garlic</a> from the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University.</p>",

But the extent of the risk is not clear, researchers explained.</p><p>This study was prompted by evidence of Chagas in dogs working on the Mexican border.</p><p>The researchers tested blood samples from 1,660 federal government working dogs in 43 states and found that 121 dogs (more than 7 percent) had signs of an ongoing <i>T. cruzi</i> infection. Many of the infected dogs also had signs of Chagas-associated heart abnormalities that can be fatal.</p><p>The findings were presented Wednesday at the American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene annual meeting, in New Orleans.</p><p>\"We were surprised to find that so many dogs, including those working outside of the kissing bug range, had been exposed to the parasite <i>T. cruzi</i> and were exhibiting heart abnormalities associated with the disease,\" said study author Alyssa Meyers, a doctoral candidate at Texas A&amp;M University.</p><p>Meyers said the relatively high rate of Chagas infections in the dogs doesn't mean there's an increasing threat to people. </p><p>\"A positive dog usually signals that infected kissing bugs are in the environment,\" she noted in a society news release. \"But the risk to humans is likely not equal to dogs, in part because dogs have a tendency to eat bugs that could be infected with the parasite and dogs spend more time outdoors.</p><p>\"Not all dogs that are exposed to the parasite develop cardiac disease. Many can live a happy, healthy life,\" Meyers added. \"We are trying to understand why some dogs remain asymptomatic, while others develop Chagas cardiomyopathy. These dogs play a critical role in our country's security, and we want to make sure we are doing everything we can do to keep them healthy.\"</p><p>Kissing bugs can thrive in locations such as kennels. The dogs used by U.S. agencies train at facilities in Texas and Virginia, two states with known populations of kissing bugs that carry the Chagas parasite, and it's likely that some dogs were exposed while at these facilities, the study authors said.</p><p>\"From previous studies we knew that shelter and stray dogs were at risk for exposure, likely because of their time spent outdoors, and perhaps the dogs working along the U.S.-Mexico border who spend long hours outside often at night might be equally exposed,\" Meyers said.</p><p>\"We were not expecting infection in dogs that spend most of their time working along the border with Canada or in airports in Nebraska,\" she added.</p><p>Research presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until it has been published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/chagas/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Chagas disease</a>.</p>",

Symptoms can range from mild to severe, and include difficulties with socialization and communication.</p><p>Scientists have begun to believe environmental factors play a role in its development, and research studies are zeroing in on air pollution.</p><p>This Canadian study looked at children born in Vancouver from 2004 through 2009. The researchers evaluated exposure to three common air pollutants: nitrogen dioxide; PM2.5 (tiny particles of combustion); and nitric oxide. They also took into account other factors such as child's sex, the month and year of birth, the mother's age and birthplace, city living, and income.</p><p>Only prenatal exposure to higher levels of nitric oxide appeared to increase odds for autism, Pagalan said. </p><p>Of more than 132,000 children whose records were examined, 1 percent were diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder by their 5th birthday.</p><p>The effect was modest -- just a 7 percent higher risk for every 11 parts per billion increase in nitric oxide, the study found.</p><p>Pagalan cautioned that this study cannot prove air pollution causes autism, only that they are associated. \"Our research did not focus on causal mechanisms, but instead on identifying environmental risk factors, which helps identify opportunities for prevention,\" he said.</p><p>Vancouver is a city known for low levels of air pollution, the researchers pointed out. </p><p>These findings do not mean that other types of air pollutants or combinations of pollution aren't potential triggers of autism. This is an area for further study, the study authors noted.</p><p>What causes autism isn't entirely clear. Research into possible environmental culprits is relatively recent, so scientists don't fully understand the links, Pagalan added.  </p><p>But the new study findings are consistent with those from studies done in the United States, Israel and Taiwan, he and his colleagues said.</p><p>\"Researchers have hypothesized that environmental exposures affect the immune or endocrine systems, or cause oxidative stress and inflammation,\" he said. \"This, in turn, may affect neurodevelopment.\" </p><p>In any case, the effects of air pollution on the risk for autism spectrum disorder, while apparent, are small, said Thomas Frazier, chief science officer at Autism Speaks, an autism advocacy organization in the United States.</p><p>\"Even for nitric oxide, the effects are very small,\" Frazier said. \"This may be due to the still relatively crude measurement of exposure, since we don't have actual biological exposure data for each child.\"</p><p>Whether reducing exposure to nitric oxide will decrease the likelihood of autism spectrum disorder needs to be studied, Frazier said. </p><p>The report was published online Nov. 19 in <i>JAMA Pediatrics</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>For more on autism spectrum disorders, visit the <a href=\" https://www.hhs.gov/programs/topic-sites/autism/index.html \" target=\"_new\"> U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a>.</p>",

It doesn't need the brain to walk,\" Oxley said.</p><p>Implanted electrodes that provide direct electrical stimulation to the spinal cord have been shown to allow movement of previously paralyzed legs.</p><p>For example, last month the Mayo Clinic reported on the case of a 29-year-old paraplegic who now can walk about the length of a football field with assistance.</p><p>The new study takes the medicine and technology of spinal stimulation even further in two ways.</p><p>First, patients were implanted with an array of electrodes down the spinal cord, which allowed researchers to target individual muscle groups in the legs.</p><p>\"Specific configurations of electrodes are activated to control the appropriate groups of muscles, mimicking the signals that the brain would deliver to produce walking,\" explained co-researcher Dr. Jocelyne Bloch, a neurosurgeon with Lausanne University Hospital. Bloch compared the targeted stimulation to the precision of a Swiss watch.</p><p>Second, and even more important, the research team fine-tuned the stimulation to work in conjunction with the patients' proprioceptive sensory system.</p><p>Proprioception is your ability to know the exact position of your legs at all times, allowing you to precisely coordinate their movements, Oxley explained.</p><p>\"When you close your eyes, you know where your leg is, without having to look at it,\" Oxley said. \"There's a complex network of information coming back into the spinal cord from the leg about where your leg is in space.\"</p><p>Continuous nerve stimulation overloads a person's proprioceptive system, researchers discovered.</p><p>\"If you stimulate the entire spinal cord, you will activate all the muscles at the same time and block leg movement,\" Courtine said.</p><p>When the stimulation was fed in pulses that worked in conjunction with the proprioceptive system, patients achieved remarkable improvement in their ability to move previously paralyzed legs in coordination, the researchers said.</p><p>All three study participants were able to walk with body-weight support after only one week spent calibrating the nerve stimulation to their individual brain patterns, Courtine said.</p><p>\"They figured out how to deliver these pulses of stimulation into the spinal cord at the right pace, at the right beat, that would not disrupt that proprioceptive sensory system,\" Oxley said.</p><p>Long, high-intensity training sessions appear to have triggered the nervous system's ability to reorganize nerve pathways around damaged nerves, researchers said. As a result, patients have improved motor function even when the electrical stimulation has been turned off.</p><p>Another patient, Sebastian Tobler, said he can now walk a few steps hands-free in the lab with the aid of electrical stimulation. He can even trike uphill outdoors, using a special three-wheeled cycle that uses both hand- and leg-operated cranks.</p><p>\"I can support more and more weight on my legs and have more and more control with my legs,\" said Tobler, 47, who had both legs completely paralyzed after a 2013 mountain biking accident.</p><p>The patients were given watches that adapt the electrical stimulation to their needs based on voice commands.</p><p>But none of the researchers would say that a full cure for paralysis is on its way, based on this research.</p><p>\"I hope we can develop some kind of walker or exoskeleton combined with stimulation so we can get people out of the wheelchair,\" Courtine said. \"They might not walk around, but they will feel better and will have a lot of health benefits associated with this mobilization of their body.\"</p><p>The advance offered by this study is a \"real breakthrough\" in terms of restoring mobility to some paralyzed patients, even though they likely won't achieve fully independent walking, Oxley said.</p><p>\"Cure is a very strong word, and this is not a cure,\" Oxley said. \"This is the first possible treatment that can potentially change the course of rehabilitation outcome in terms of walking.\"</p><p>The findings were published Nov. 1 in the journals <i>Nature</i> and <i>Nature Neuroscience</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation has more about <a href=\"https://www.christopherreeve.org/living-with-paralysis/rehabilitation/functional-electrical-stimulation\" target=\"_new\">functional electrical stimulation</a>.</p>",

She is a pediatric emergency medicine fellow at Emory University in Atlanta. </p><p>But since so many burns are caused by microwavable instant soup and noodles, \"any school-age child consuming these products needs to be adequately supervised,\" she said. </p><p>Dr. Michael Cooper, director of Staten Island University Hospital's burn center in New York City, said the study mirrors what he often sees in practice. </p><p>\"We do see instant soup and noodle burns with kids in this age group,\" he said. </p><p>The good news is that most of the children were treated in the emergency room and then sent home, Cooper noted. Most didn't have to stay in the hospital, and would likely heal in two weeks or less. </p><p>\"These burns are painful, but most appear to be superficial,\" he explained. </p><p>Cooper said the scenario he often sees is that the parent has heated the prepackaged container of soup, and given it to the child. While eating, the child knocks it over and gets burned. </p><p>A simple solution might be taking the noodles or soup from the original container and transferring them to a bowl the child is accustomed to using, Cooper suggested. A bowl probably isn't as tall as some of the instant-food containers. </p><p>For the study, the researchers reviewed data from the U.S. National Electronic Injury Surveillance System  from 2006 to 2016. They looked for kids aged 4 to 12 with scald burns caused by microwavable instant soup, instant noodles, cups of soup, or water for making instant soup. </p><p>Scald burns associated with instant soups and noodles affected more than 9,500 children each year, the findings showed. The average age of a child with such a burn was 7 years old. </p><p>The most commonly burned site was the child's torso -- about 40 percent of burns occurred here. </p><p>Allen said the database didn't specify whether kids had cooked the foods in the microwave themselves, or if parents or another caregiver had done so. </p><p>She added that injuries may occur when someone grabs a hot container from the microwave and flinches because it's so hot, spilling it on themselves. </p><p>Allen also noted that instant noodles absorb the liquid during cooking. So if a child drops a container of noodles, the hot food may stick to the body. </p><p>Cooper said the study shows a need for more education of parents, grandparents and other caregivers. \"People need to be more aware that these burns can happen,\" he said. </p><p>The study is scheduled for presentation Monday at an American Academy of Pediatrics meeting, in Orlando. Research presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about preventing burns in kids from <a href=\"https://www.safekids.org/tip/burns-and-scalds-prevention-tips\" target=\"_new\">Safe Kids Worldwide</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 9, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Sudden cardiac arrest -- when the heart stops beating -- is one of the leading causes of death in the U.S. To help save lives, automated external defibrillators, which shock the heart back into a regular beat, have been placed in many public places. </p> <p>Now, these portable AED devices may improve the chance of survival among children and teens, according to a new study presented Sunday at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions meeting in Chicago.</p> <p>The researchers analyzed statistics in a national database on 971 cardiac arrests in children ages 18 and under that occurred outside a hospital between January 2013 and December 2017. An AED was used 10.3 percent of the time, but rates varied across age groups. For infants, defibrillators were used to help 2.3 percent. But AED use became more common as children got older: 8.3 percent among kids ages 2 to 5; 12.4 percent among those 6 to 11; and 18.2 percent among 12- to 18-year-olds.</p> <p>Older kids may be more likely to have a bystander use a defibrillator because they may be more likely to go into cardiac arrest in a place, such as a school, that has an AED, said the study's lead researcher Dr. Heather Griffis, director of the Healthcare Analytics Unit at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.</p> <p>Bystanders might also be afraid to use a defibrillator on infants and preschool-age children out of fear of injuring them, said the study's senior researcher Dr. Joe Rossano, a pediatric cardiologist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.</p> <p>\"If a child has an arrest, it's a scary thing,\" Rossano said. \"People don't want to do something wrong. But anything you do is going to be helpful.\"</p> <p>Children treated with an AED by a bystander had a survival rate of 29.1 percent, compared to 23.7 percent for children who were not. The rates varied by age and race, with children who were 12 to 18 years old or white having better outcomes than younger children or those who were black or Hispanic. Griffis said similar racial differences also are seen in adults.</p> <p>\"It's unfortunate that we're still seeing these disparities across race, ethnicity and neighborhoods,\" Griffis said. \"But this is a great opportunity for education and to increase availability\" of AEDs in neighborhoods that don't yet have them.</p> <p>More than 350,000 Americans -- including about 7,000 children --  experience cardiac arrests outside of the hospital each year. AEDs come with step-by-step instructions that make it possible for people without specialized training to use them.</p> <p>Dr. Alson Inaba directs pediatric advanced life support classes at Queen's Medical Center in Honolulu and said the study added important new information on the use of AEDs in children. </p> <p>Inaba, who was not involved in the research, said that bystanders should start CPR on a cardiac arrest victim of any age after calling 911.</p> <p>\"The bottom line is that starting CPR immediately is your first priority,\" Inaba said. \"Don't be afraid.\"</p> <p>Then, send someone to get a defibrillator. \"When you combine CPR with an AED, the survival rates increase,\" he said.</p> <p>Indeed, a separate study published earlier this year in the AHA journal <i>Circulation</i> found that survival rates doubled when bystanders used a defibrillator to help an adult who had experienced cardiac arrest before emergency responders arrived.</p> <p>\"Defibrillators work,\" Rossano said. \"It's something anybody can do, and the more that are available, the more opportunities there are to save lives.\"</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 31, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- For weeks, Donna Greene got the brush-off when she asked the pharmacist about getting her second dose of Shingrix, the sought-after but scarce new shingles vaccine.</p><p>Check back next week. Check in two weeks. We just don't know, she was told at last. Finally, in mid-October, Greene got lucky.</p><p>\"My husband's friend &hellip; said he wasn't feeling well because he had had the shingles shot and his flu shot on the same day, and I said, 'Really? Wait. It's in?' \" said Greene, 67, a retired county government spokeswoman in Greenburgh, N.Y. \"I went in the next day.\"</p><p>For the over-50 set, Shingrix can be harder to come by than a ticket to \"Hamilton\" or a Paul McCartney concert. For months, demand for the vaccine, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 2017, has outpaced supply, frustrating patients and providers alike. </p><p>\"It's like a blue-light special at Kmart -- people are calling and looking for that vaccine,\" said Heather Free, a spokeswoman for the American Pharmacists Association. \"But I don't anticipate that this is going to be an issue much longer.\"</p><p>A spokesman for the British drug giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), maker of Shingrix, underscored that view.</p><p>\"We are shipping a large volume of vaccine this week,\" said GSK vaccines spokesman Sean Clements.</p><p>\"We understand that this is a challenging situation to manage and GSK is fully committed to expediting resupply throughout 2018,\" he added.</p><p><b>Better protection</b></p><p>The unprecedented demand came after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention designated Shingrix as the preferred shingles vaccine. The CDC recommends two doses, two to six months apart, for adults age 50 and over -- even if a patient previously received Merck's Zostavax, a live shingles vaccine used since 2006.</p><p>Anyone who has had chicken pox -- 99 percent of Americans over age 40, the CDC estimates -- is at risk for shingles, also known as herpes zoster. That's because both conditions are caused by the varicella zoster virus, which stays inside the body, where it can reactivate years later. </p><p>Shingles causes a painful, blistering rash that can leave lasting and debilitating nerve pain in its wake. It can also lead to pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness, encephalitis and death. The risk increases with age.</p><p>Zostavax reduces shingles risk by 51 percent, while clinical trials found Shingrix to be more than 90 percent effective, according to the CDC.</p><p>\"A friend got shingles after that earlier shot so we were already alerted to the fact that it was ineffective,\" Greene said. \"I don't think it was as bad a case, but she was saying, 'You don't ever want to get this disease.' \"</p><p>That kind of buzz, along with early advertising, fueled the ongoing squeeze on Shingrix supplies. </p><p>The supply is especially tight in areas with large populations of older people, Free said.</p><p>One of those is North Carolina, where a Raleigh Walgreens' had a four-page waitlist by mid-October. A supermarket pharmacy on the Oregon coast, meanwhile, got a small shipment of Shingrix that was gone within days. \"It doesn't last when we get it in, and we never know when more is coming,\" said the pharmacist, who would not give her name because she was not authorized to speak for the chain.</p><p><b>'Don't give up'</b></p><p>So what's a consumer to do?</p><p>GSK has an online tool patients can use to find pharmacies and providers who have offered the vaccine. Though Clements said it's updated regularly, he suggests double-checking with providers, because supplies are sometimes depleted faster than the site reflects.</p><p>You can also ask your provider to put you on a waitlist. Not all are keeping them, but it can't hurt to ask. Some pharmacies, especially smaller, independent ones, also have voice messages with daily updates.</p><p>Also, if you've had your first dose of Shingrix, don't worry if the six-month window closes before you get the second shot.

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 31, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- You're less likely to pick up a nasty infection during a hospital stay in the United States than you were just a few years ago, a new report finds. </p><p>Between 2011 and 2015, a patient's risk of catching a hospital-acquired infection dropped 16 percent, researchers said. </p><p>\"The findings are encouraging. Progress is being made in infections affecting hospitals in the United States. But more work needs to be done,\" said the study's lead author, Dr. Shelley Magill, a medical officer with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p><p>Health care-associated infections are a significant threat to patient safety. The study authors estimated that in 2011, about 648,000 patients had at least one health-care associated infection in the United States. </p><p>Pneumonia was the most common infection, followed by digestive infections and surgical site infections, the study found. </p><p>Most of the digestive infections were caused by <i>Clostridioides difficile</i>.  These <i>C. difficile</i> infections are typically related to antibiotic use, and can be deadly. Magill said these infections didn't show a decline. </p><p>Working with 10 state health departments, the researchers recruited up to 25 hospitals in each state to participate in the study. Each participating hospital chose one day during a specified time period to record how many patients had infections. </p><p>In 2011, 183 hospitals participated. In 2015, 199 hospitals were included. </p><p>Four percent of hospital patients had a health care-associated infection in 2011. By 2015, that number had dropped to 3.2 percent. </p><p>The biggest declines were seen in surgical site infections and urinary tract infections, according to the study. </p><p>Magill said fewer people had urinary catheters in 2015. Also, she said, there was a focus on getting those catheters out of patients as soon as possible to reduce infection risk. </p><p>The types of surgical site infection vary, but Magill said specific efforts to reduce these infections appear to be paying off. However, the new study didn't collect information on the specific practices hospitals were taking. </p><p>Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said this was a very well-done study that captures data from a lot of hospitals. </p><p>\"We've been making progress against health care-associated infections, and it's hard to move the needle on a national level. But progress is still slow. These findings shouldn't make us complacent. We have a lot of work ahead still,\" said Jha, who wasn't involved with the study. </p><p>What can patients do to protect themselves? </p><p>One of the most important steps in infection prevention is remarkably simple -- frequent, thorough hand-washing. Jha said if you haven't seen a doctor or nurse washing their hands before they exam you, it's fine to ask. </p><p>\"There's nothing wrong with making sure people are doing what they're supposed to be doing,\" he said. </p><p>Also, if you notice any change in the way you're feeling, let someone on your health care team know about the change, because it may signal a developing infection. </p><p>\"Be vigilant in the hospital if new symptoms develop,\" Jha said. </p><p>Magill agreed that hand-washing is \"absolutely essential.\" </p><p><i>C. difficile</i> infections remain a challenge, Magill and Jha said. And Magill said the rates of pneumonia are also concerning. </p><p>The study results were published Nov. 1 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn what you can do to stay safe during hospitalizations from the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hai/patientsafety/patient-safety.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

That's the primary message emerging from research into Alzheimer's, a disease of the brain that appears to be deeply driven by what happens to the heart and blood vessels. </p> <p>The link between high blood pressure and Alzheimer's disease has been a particular focus of recent studies. </p> <p>\"High blood pressure, uncontrolled, causes damage to virtually every organ system,\" said Jeff Keller, director of the Institute for Dementia Research and Prevention at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. \"It shouldn't be surprising that the brain, the most vascularized and energy-dependent organ of the body, is greatly the most damaged by fluctuations in blood pressure control.\"</p> <p>Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia and is the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States. About 5.7 million Americans have been diagnosed with the disease, including 200,000 people under the age of 65. Those numbers are expected to skyrocket as more Baby Boomers reach retirement age and beyond.</p> <p>At the annual Alzheimer's Association meeting in July, researchers presented preliminary findings from a study that looked at the impact of aggressively reducing high blood pressure to currently recommended levels. It found the effort decreased the risk of developing mild cognitive impairment, a common precursor to dementia.</p> <p>In August, a study in the journal <i>Neurology</i> found older people with higher blood pressure were more likely to have brain lesions -- areas of dead tissue -- caused by low blood supply. Researchers also found these patients had more \"tangles,\" or twisted strands of protein that are considered common markers of Alzheimer's.</p> <p>Blood pressure levels have been in the spotlight the past year after new guidelines issued last November by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association redefined high blood pressure as 130/80 versus the previous 140/90.</p> <p>According to AHA statistics, about 103 million American adults, or roughly 46 percent of the nation's adult population, now qualify as having high blood pressure. But about 16 percent of them don't know they have the condition. </p> <p>High blood pressure can be reduced through lifestyle changes, such as reducing sodium [salt] in the diet and exercising, as well as medication. </p> <p>\"Think of it as a cocktail that should include a good diet, some exercise and, if needed, some medication,\" she said. \"There's no magic pill. It's a lot of work. But what's good for the heart really is good for the brain. It's that simple.\"</p> <p>The Alzheimer's Association this year is launching the U.S. Study to Protect Brain Health Through Lifestyle Intervention to Reduce Risk, a clinical trial that includes an exercise regimen, nutritional guidance, and cognitive and social stimulation. The organization has a tool on its website to help match visitors to hundreds of clinical trials across the country. </p> <p>Keller's institution is one of several overseeing research that specifically examines the impact of blood pressure reduction on reducing Alzheimer's risk among people who have a family history or significant memory concerns. In addition to blood pressure control, the Risk Reduction for Alzheimer's Disease trial also is examining the impact of exercise and cholesterol management.</p> <p>\"Hypertension [high blood pressure] is rarely seen in isolation. It's usually associated with other risk factors or chronic conditions, like obesity,\" Keller said. \"What we're doing is trying to decrease as many vascular factors as we can.\"</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Nov.1, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The first Food and Drug Administration-approved drug containing an ingredient derived from the marijuana plant went on sale Thursday in the United States.</p><p>Epidiolex is a twice-daily oral solution -- a cannabidiol, or CBD liquid -- made by Britain-based GW Pharmaceuticals. It is approved for use in patients 2 years old and older with two types of epileptic syndromes, Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.</p><p>\"Because these patients have historically not responded well to available seizure medications, there has been a dire need for new therapies that aim to reduce the frequency and impact of seizures,\" Justin Gover, CEO of GW Pharmaceuticals, said in a written statement.</p><p>The FDA approved Epidiolex in June. CBD is derived from the cannabis plant but it does not create any \"high\" in users. CBD oils and other CBD products have become popular across the United States in recent years, for the treatment of pain and other issues.</p><p>This was the first time the FDA approved such a product for any medicinal use, however. In a statement, agency Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said regulatory approval and oversight is important to safeguard patients.</p><p>\"Because of the adequate and well-controlled clinical studies that supported this approval, prescribers can have confidence in the drug's uniform strength and consistent delivery,\" he explained.</p><p>An FDA advisory panel unanimously recommended in April that Epidiolex be approved for use in the United States.</p><p><b>Low doses proved effective</b></p><p>Although CBD oil has become a trendy cure-all, treatment of epilepsy is the only use that has garnered significant scientific evidence supporting its usefulness.</p><p>Epidiolex made headlines in May when a clinical trial found that even low doses of the drug could help patients with epilepsy.</p><p>In the trial, patients taking a 10-milligram (mg) daily dose of pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol experienced nearly as great a reduction in seizures as patients on 20 mg, and with fewer side effects, said the lead researcher of that study, Dr. Orrin Devinsky. He directs NYU Langone's Comprehensive Epilepsy Center in New York City.</p><p>This was the third clinical trial to show that Epidiolex is useful in treating two rare forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, Devinsky said.</p><p> GW Pharmaceuticals funded the clinical trial. It compared two different doses of Epidiolex head-to-head and against an inactive placebo, Devinsky said.</p><p>A total of 225 patients suffering from Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were divided into three groups. Those taking 20 mg of Epidiolex a day had 42 percent fewer seizures, on average, compared with 37 percent fewer seizures in the group taking 10 mg of the drug, and a 17 percent reduction in the placebo group.</p><p><b>Bigger dose not necessarily better</b></p><p>But while the 20-mg dose was slightly more effective, it was not the first choice of parents, Devinsky said.</p><p>\"When parents were asked to rate how their children did best, they actually had a slight preference for the 10-mg dose without knowing what it was,\" he added.</p><p>That's because these children did not experience as many side effects from the cannabidiol, which can include tiredness, decreased appetite, diarrhea and signs of possible liver damage, Devinsky explained.</p><p>\"They got the vast majority of the benefits with fewer of the side effects,\" he said.</p><p>The study also showed that Epidiolex is a safe treatment, with only seven patients dropping out of the trial due to side effects -- six from the 20-mg group and one from the 10-mg group.</p><p>\"Compared to other drugs used to treat epilepsy, I think Epidiolex, which is 99-percent pure cannabidiol, has a better side-effect profile than many of the available drugs,\" Devinsky said.</p><p>Still, the FDA noted in its approval statement that side effects could occur, such as sleepiness, lethargy, poor appetite and infections, among others. And like other drugs that treat epilepsy, Epidiolex will come with a special warning that use may be tied to a higher odds of depression, aggression and suicidal thoughts.</p><p><b>Best for severe cases</b></p><p>According to Dr. Angel Hernandez, of the Helen DeVos Children's Hospital in Grand Rapids, Mich., these results prove that pharmaceutical-grade CBD helps suppress seizures and \"increases our options to treat many of these patients with very, very difficult-to-control epilepsies.\" Hernandez is division chief of neuroscience at the hospital. </p><p>\"We're talking about types of epilepsy that are extremely difficult to treat with medication,\" he said. \"Most of these children and adults do not respond to normal pharmacological treatment.\"</p><p>No one is exactly sure why CBD has this beneficial effect, both Devinsky and Hernandez said. It appears to work on receptors that alter brain chemistry in a way that reduces the chances of a seizure.</p><p>The doctors noted that these effects were seen in patients taking a highly refined form of CBD produced by a drug maker. It's not known whether patients in states where medical marijuana is legal would see the same effects in CBD oil produced by small companies with no federal oversight.</p><p>It's also not clear whether CBD would help people with more common forms of epilepsy. Devinsky said small clinical trials have so far found no benefit in people with focal epilepsy, where seizures start on one side of the brain.</p><p>\"I think we need more studies,\" Devinsky said. \"It's not been investigated in generalized epilepsy, and I think we need a larger study in focal epilepsy.\"</p><p>The Epidioloex study findings were published online May 17 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Epilepsy Foundation has more about <a href=\"https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/treating-seizures-and-epilepsy/other-treatment-approaches/medical-marijuana-and-epilepsy\" target=\"_new\">medical marijuana and epilepsy</a>.</p>",

Ride-share vehicles typically don't come with a car seat, and an option to request one is available only in some cities, the study authors said.</p><p>Parents can provide their own car seat, but many are bulky, heavy and require a separate base, posing challenges during vacations or extended travel, according to the researchers.</p><p>The investigators found that 34 states exempt taxis and for-hire vehicles from child restraint requirements, but it's often unclear if these exemptions also apply to ride-share vehicles.</p><p>Currently, Georgia is the only state that distinguishes between ride-sharing and other for-hire vehicles. In that state, for-hire vehicles are exempt but ride-share drivers are required to provide car seats if needed, the findings showed.</p><p>The researchers also surveyed parents and found that more than one-third use ride-share services with their children, and up to half reported not providing appropriate child safety seats while riding in a ride-share vehicle with their families.</p><p>Overall, parents were interested in using child safety seats in ride-shares, but often felt stymied by the lack of car seat options and uncertainty about the rules.</p><p>Focus groups with ride-share drivers found that of the three-quarters who'd given rides to young children, only half recalled using a car seat.</p><p>\"These findings suggest that parents would like to be able to transport their children more safely when using ride-share vehicles, but there is a real need for user-friendly information about rules, regulations and resources surrounding travel with children,\" said the study's principal investigator Justin Owens. He is a research scientist at Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, in Blacksburg, Va.</p><p>\"For that reason, we have created a website (www.kidsridesafe.org) that aims to provide caregivers and ride-share drivers with this information in an easy-to-access manner,\" Owens added in a university news release.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on the value of car seats for children, visit the <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/on-the-go/Pages/Car-Safety-Seats-Information-for-Families.aspx\" target=\"_new\">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 29, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Growing up, Alanna Gardner learned she couldn't be too active. If she was, she would faint.</p> <p>Sometimes the spells prompted an emergency room visit. Doctors, however, never diagnosed the cause.</p> <p>Reluctantly, she gave up participating in sports.</p> <p>But after going away to college, Alanna started to wonder if the fainting was a signal that she simply wasn't in shape. She began exercising -- slowly at first. She maintained a healthy diet. And she had no more mysterious episodes.</p> <p>At 25, she trusted her body enough to sign up for Philadelphia's 10-mile Broad Street Run. Her training plan called for her to run a 10K event a few weeks before.</p> <p>Alanna considered herself to be in the best shape of her life. So when fatigue hit during the event, she felt \"defeated.\" And soon she was. As she crossed the finish line, she fainted for the first time in seven years.</p> <p>\"I couldn't find my friend or an ambulance, but I wasn't worried because it was such a normal thing,\" she said. \"So I just sat down figuring someone would find me.\"</p> <p>The next thing she remembers is waking up in the hospital.</p> <p>Alanna had experienced a major heart attack that caused her to go into cardiac arrest. In other words, not only did she have a problem with her heart's plumbing (a blocked artery that limited blood flow), this caused the heart's electrical power to go out.</p> <p>Luckily, two race participants who were nurses saw her in distress and immediately began CPR. At the hospital, doctors performed a procedure in which they opened the artery using a stent. She was placed in an induced coma for three days to help her body recover from all the trauma.</p> <p>Additional testing at the hospital revealed she had an anomalous or \"misplaced\" left coronary artery. In this congenital heart defect, the left coronary artery begins carrying oxygen-rich blood from the pulmonary artery instead of from the aorta. As a result, the heart doesn't get enough blood and oxygen.</p> <p>When Alanna exerted herself, her defective artery became pinched as it worked to supply enough blood. As a child, that pinch would relax as soon as she fainted, and the blood supply would be restored, reviving her. But when she fainted after the race, the pinch didn't release. This caused a blockage and fluid flowing back into her heart.</p> <p>A few weeks later, Alanna underwent open-heart bypass surgery.</p> <p>After learning her condition could have a genetic link, Alanna heard from several members of her family on her dad's side that they too had congenital heart defects.</p> <p>\"No one had ever talked about it before because no one associated fainting with a heart issue,\" she said. \"Had we known more about our family's history, we may have been able to make better use of our health care appointments and push for more answers.\"</p> <p>While Alanna couldn't change the fact that she had a heart defect, doctors said her good overall health played a role in her recovery.</p> <p>Alanna's commitment to a heart-healthy diet and plenty of exercise helped inspire her mom, Yolanda, to take a harder look at lifestyle changes she could make.</p> <p>After Alanna's heart attack, Yolanda was diagnosed with high blood pressure. Combined with a family history of heart disease and diabetes, Yolanda decided to change her diet to cut out sweets, fatty foods and red meat. She also changed some long-held family recipes to make them healthier.</p> <p>Yolanda, 64, also changed her approach toward health care visits, being more proactive and getting a second opinion if she doesn't feel her questions are being answered.</p> <p>\"I come in armed with questions and research,\" she said. \"It's a patient's responsibility to participate and not just go along for the ride. It's up to each of us to take care of our own health and make a commitment to changes.\"</p> <p>Now 32, Alanna works as a therapist and a fitness instructor in Philadelphia.</p> <p>\"Having the heart attack at that age is extremely traumatic and it definitely rocked my identity, but so many positive things came out of it,\" she said. \"I was able to reignite my passion for teaching people about fitness and health. I'm giving my students a way to see life's challenges as something you can grow from.\"</p>",

The poll found that 43 percent of those in their 50s and 60s had urinary incontinence. That percentage jumped to 51 percent among those over 65.</p><p>But two-thirds of those women had not discussed the problem with a doctor, and only 38 percent said they do exercises to strengthen muscles that can help keep urine from leaking.</p><p>\"Urinary incontinence is a common condition that may not be routinely screened for in primary care, yet it can impact a woman's quality of life and health, and is usually treatable,\" said Dr. Carolyn Swenson, a urogynecologist with the University of Michigan. She helped develop the poll questions and analyze the findings.</p><p>Of the women who said they'd experienced urine leakage, 41 percent said it was a major problem or somewhat of a problem. One-third of those with leakage said it occurred almost every day.</p><p>Most found ways of coping on their own, according to the poll -- from using pads or special underwear to wearing dark clothing and limiting fluid intake.</p><p>But nearly half worried it would get worse as they got older.</p><p>\"It's not an inevitable part of aging and shouldn't be overlooked,\" Swenson noted in a university news release.</p><p>The most common triggers of urine leakage were coughing or sneezing (79 percent), trying to get to a bathroom in time (64 percent), laughing (49 percent) and exercise (37 percent).</p><p>The poll, published Nov. 1, was conducted by the University of Michigan Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, and sponsored by AARP and Michigan Medicine, the university's medical center.</p><p>\"The last thing that older women should be doing is avoiding exercise or not being able to enjoy other activities that make life worthwhile,\" said poll director Dr. Preeti Malani, a professor of internal medicine at Michigan with special training in geriatric medicine.</p><p>\"We hope these findings will help spur conversations between women and their health care providers, so that activities aren't limited,\" Malani added.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians has more on <a href=\"https://familydoctor.org/condition/urinary-incontinence/?adfree=true\" target=\"_new\">urinary incontinence</a>.</p>",

One group of participants was told that their eligibility to take part in the survey didn't depend on whether or not they'd had a flu shot. This was the control group.</p><p>But other groups were offered $5, $10 or $20 for taking part in the survey and were told they were eligible only if they had or had not received a recent flu shot.</p><p>In the control group, 52 percent of respondents said they'd had a recent flu shot. But among those who were told that their survey eligibility depended on recent flu vaccination and received payments of $5, $10 or $20, rates of participants who said they'd had a flu shot were 63.1 percent, 62.8 percent and 62.1 percent, respectively.</p><p>Rates among those who were told that their eligibility depended on having not received a recent flu vaccination were 46.5 percent at $5, 41.8 percent at $10, and 46.7 percent at $20.</p><p>The only differences between the groups in the study were their eligibility criteria and payment amounts, so the differences in their self-reported vaccination rates were due to lying, the University of Pennsylvania researchers said.</p><p>They calculated that between 10.5 and nearly 23 percent of participants lied about their eligibility to participate.</p><p>\"This type of behavior not only undermines a study's integrity and its results, but in a study with eligibility criteria that are intended to protect participants, it also has the potential to put participants at risk,\" first author Holly Fernandez Lynch said in a university news release.

But now, Canadian researchers say it may become unnecessary in women aged 55 or older who have one negative result with the test.</p><p>The DNA-based HPV test is highly accurate in detecting 14 high-risk strains of the virus that causes the majority of cervical cancers.</p><p>In the new study, researchers first gathered data on more than 200,000 women living in British Columbia. They then created a mathematical model that estimated the lifetime risk of cervical cancer in older women, all of who had not been vaccinated against HPV.</p><p>The result: Just one negative HPV DNA test at the age of 55 suggested that a woman has a very low risk (less than 1 percent) of cervical cancer, and continued screening with this type of test would provide little benefit, according to the study.</p><p>However, the researchers said that regular screening with the traditional -- and cheaper -- Pap test up to age 75 may still prevent some cervical cancers. But even in that case, benefits would decline with age.</p><p>\"Our results suggest that for countries that use HPV testing as part of their screening, it might be possible to stop screening earlier than we are currently doing, provided women have a negative HPV test,\" said study author Talia Malagon, of McGill University in Montreal.</p><p>But one obstetrician/gynecologist said it's too soon to make firm recommendations.</p><p>\"I caution readers to use this data as a reason to stop performing cervical cancer screening after age 55,\" said Dr. Adi Davidov, who directs Ob/Gyn care at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City.</p><p>\"Firstly, this study uses mathematical modeling, which may not be accurate,\" he said. \"In addition, many patients are already skipping their annual gynecology visit because of newer recommendations of less frequent cervical cancer screening. If women stop seeing their gynecologist at age 55, I worry that other serious conditions will be left undiagnosed.\"</p><p>The new findings were published Nov. 1 in <i>The Lancet Oncology</i> journal.</p><p>Right now, most guidelines say cervical cancer screening -- done with either with the Pap test or HPV DNA test -- can be stopped after ages 65 to 69.  However, there's been a lack of high-quality evidence to support this recommendation, the researchers said.</p> <p>\"Cervical cancers are caused by infections with oncogenic [cancer-causing] HPV types,\" Malagon explained in a journal news release. For decades, doctors have turned to the Pap test \"to detect the precancerous lesions caused by HPV, which can then be treated before they ever progress to cervical cancer,\" she added.</p><p>The Pap test has saved thousands of lives, but \"it is far from perfect because it does not always detect the precancerous lesions which develop into cancer,\" Malagon said.</p><p>\"We have known for some time that directly screening instead for the HPV types that cause cervical cancer performs just as well, if not better, than [the Pap test] for screening in women below the age of 60,\" she said.</p><p>What hasn't been known is whether an older woman who tests negative on an HPV screen can safely stop screening, as happens for some older women whose Pap tests come back negative.</p><p>The new study might help clear up that question, Malagon said.</p><p>She cautioned that the study \"does not necessarily suggest that all screening should stop at age 55, since the benefits of continued screening depend on the type of screening used. For countries that still use [Pap test] screening, screening at older ages should further reduce the risk of cervical cancer,\" she noted.</p><p>Furthermore, \"our study did not include any cost-effectiveness analysis, which will be a useful next step to inform policy decisions before any change in guidance is considered,\" Malagon said.</p><p>Dr. Jill Rabin helps direct Women's Health Programs at Northwell Health in New Hyde Park, N.Y. She called the findings \"interesting,\" but offered several caveats.</p><p>She said factors that might cause \"latent\" HPV to go undetected -- things like stress or certain medical conditions -- might be in play for some older women, rendering continued HPV screening valuable.</p>  <p>Furthermore, one rare but potentially deadly form of cervical cancer, called adenocarcinoma of the cervix, does not rely on HPV and \"most likely will go undetected until its later stages if a regular routine examination is not performed,\" Rabin noted.</p><p>She also agreed with David that cervical cancer screening has long been a \"gateway\" to better gynecologic care generally.</p><p>\"My concern is if they stop coming for Pap tests, they will miss an examination which may help uncover other medical and gynecological issues, such as breast, uterine, ovarian and colon cancer,\" Rabin said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-fact-sheet\" target=\"_new\">HPV</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 19, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- When someone with HIV has the virus suppressed with medication, there is virtually no chance of passing it on to sex partners, a new review concludes.</p><p>The Public Health Agency of Canada pulled together studies from the last decade looking at the risk of HIV transmission among partners where one person is HIV-positive and one is not.</p><p>It found there were no cases of transmission when the HIV-positive partner was on drug \"cocktails\" that were keeping the virus suppressed. \"Suppressed\" means there are fewer than 200 copies of the virus per milliliter of blood.</p><p>In those cases, the review found, there were no HIV transmissions even when couples did not use condoms.</p><p>Experts said the findings are good news for people living with HIV -- and have implications for current laws in Canada, the United States and elsewhere.</p><p>At issue are laws that subject HIV-positive people to possible criminal prosecution for not telling their sexual partners about their status. They exist in Canada and many U.S. states.</p><p>But the laws are \"rooted in the 1980s view of the disease,\" said Perry Halkitis, dean of the School of Public Health at Rutgers University in Piscataway, N.J.</p><p>That is, they reflect an era when HIV was a death sentence instead of the manageable chronic condition it is today. Drug therapies that first became available in the 1990s changed the face of HIV treatment.</p><p>And in recent years, Halkitis said, studies have offered \"a ton of evidence\" that when those drugs suppress the virus, it is not transmissible to person's sex partners.</p><p>\"These criminalization laws do nothing but stigmatize HIV-positive people. They need to be revisited,\" said Halkitis, who was not involved in the new research.</p><p>In Canada, the findings have already had an impact. The Department of Justice Canada, which collaborated on the review, issued a report last December saying that criminal law should no longer apply to HIV-positive people who have their virus suppressed by medication.</p><p>Its report also said the laws should not apply to people who are not on medication but use condoms during sex. In the research review, the risk of HIV transmission in those cases was deemed to be \"low\" -- at just over 1 transmission for every 100 people per year.</p><p>The health agency used the word \"negligible\" to describe the risk of transmission when the virus is suppressed by medication. That means there is a theoretical risk of transmission because there is an \"exchange of bodily fluids that carry the virus,\" officials said -- but no actual confirmed cases.</p><p>\"We hope these findings help people living with HIV and their partners to make decisions, and that they help reduce the stigma experienced by people living with HIV,\" the agency said.</p><p>The latest review, led by the agency's Dr. Rachel Rodin, is based on 11 studies and one previously published research review. The studies followed steady partners -- both heterosexual and same-sex -- in various countries.</p><p>The results were published Nov. 19 in the <i>CMAJ: Canadian Medical Association Journal</i>.</p> <p>In the United States, 29 states have \"HIV-specific\" criminal laws, according to the nonprofit Center for HIV Law &amp; Policy (CHLP). That includes laws that target people who fail to disclose their HIV status to sexual partners.</p><p>Many medical organizations, like the American Medical Association and American Psychological Association, have long called for reform of those criminal laws. And the CHLP and other groups argue that it's not enough to exempt HIV-positive people who have their virus suppressed through medication.</p><p>The CHLP points to the fact that Americans have unequal access to health care, and certain groups -- including blacks and the poor -- face more obstacles in keeping their HIV levels suppressed.</p><p>That means they are unfairly targeted by criminal laws, the CHLP says.</p><p>Halkitis agreed that having HIV-specific laws at all is problematic. No other transmissible disease is subject to such criminal prosecution, he pointed out.</p><p>\"We have to stop reacting to HIV like it's still the 1980s,\" Halkitis said. And that, he added, includes having policies that are \"grounded in scientific evidence.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/transmission.html\" target=\"_new\">HIV transmission</a>.</p>",

You want a lifelong diet plan that provides micronutrients, fiber and antioxidants while still limiting calories.</p><p>That means whether you count calories or portion sizes, it's important to keep track of all high-calorie foods, even the healthful ones.</p><p>Here are some examples.</p><p>While plant oils -- such as walnut, olive, safflower, sunflower, grapeseed and sesame oils -- are better for you than butter with all its saturated fat, tablespoon for tablespoon, oils actually have more calories -- 120 to 130 calories compared to butter's 100. Use an oil spray to coat pans before cooking to conserve calories when you really need to use oil.</p><p>When eating a rainbow of veggies, winter squash and sweet potatoes are great choices in the orange color range, but 4 ounces of squash have only 44 calories compared to 84 calories for the same amount of sweet potatoes. If you need a large portion to feel full, eating squash will allow you twice the volume for the same number of calories.</p><p>Among the most nutrient-dense fruits, a large banana can have 120 calories while a cup of strawberries is barely 50. </p><p>Nutrient-rich, high-calorie foods are still good for you, but consider cutting portion sizes in half to keep the needed ceiling on your overall calorie intake.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Need a portion size reminder?

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Dec. 4, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Researchers say the ever-growing waiting list of hopeful heart transplant recipients could be trimmed down  if only more patients were given the option to open their hearts to unlikely donors.</p> <p>Two new Stanford University-led studies published Dec. 4 explore opportunities to expand the donor pool by using hearts that many transplant centers overlook: those that once belonged to people who had an active hepatitis C infection, and to those who were obese.</p> <p>The number of heart transplants has risen steadily over the past decade. More than 100,000 Americans are sick enough to need a heart transplant, but in 2017, only 3,244 actually received one. </p> <p>\"In order to meet the recipient demands of heart transplantation, we need to consider out-of- the-box strategies to expand the donor pool,\" said Dr. Yas Moayedi, lead author of a study published in the American Heart Association's journal <i>Circulation: Heart Failure</i> that looked at using hearts from donors who tested positive for hepatitis C.</p> <p>Researchers used a national registry of organ transplants and analyzed 2014-2017 data on 1,306 heart donors with hepatitis C, a blood-borne virus than can be effectively treated with antiviral medication. </p> <p>They found only 5 percent of these infected hearts were used in transplants. Yet, those heart recipients had no difference in survival within the first year of transplant compared with patients who received hearts from donors without hepatitis C. Longer-term data is needed to confirm if the positive results persist. </p> <p>The number of hepatitis C-positive donors has increased steadily since 2014, along with deaths attributed to drug overdoses related to the nation's opioid epidemic, researchers noted in the study. Heroin addicts often share needles, contributing to the rise of hepatitis C infections. </p> <p>Because the opioid epidemic has predominantly affected young adults, the average age of heart donors with hepatitis C has dropped in the last five years from 47 to 35, the study found. </p> <p>The younger age means these donors usually have fewer health problems associated with older donors, like high blood pressure or diabetes, and would normally be considered \"incredibly viable\" candidates  outside of the hepatitis C, said Moayedi, a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University in California. </p> <p>In a separate study released in the <i>Journal of the American Heart Association</i>, researchers found a similar positive outcome for patients who received their hearts from donors who were obese.</p> <p>Transplant centers reject the hearts of obese donors mainly because they believe such grafts are inferior, even though little evidence supports that idea, said Dr. Yasuhiro Shudo, the lead author of the study and an assistant professor at Stanford University School of Medicine.</p> <p>Those centers may soon not have a choice.</p> <p>\"We're seeing a (high) prevalence of obesity in the general population,\" said Shudo, pointing out that about one-third of U.S. adults are obese. \"As we see more obese people, this will lead to having more obese donors in the future.\"</p> <p>Using the same national transplant registry as the other study, the researchers examined data on 31,920 adults who received heart transplants from 2001 through 2016 and separated the donors into four groups based on their body mass index, or BMI, a ratio of weight to height often used to calculate overweight and obesity. </p> <p>Of all transplant patients, about 41 percent received a heart from donors with a normal BMI. The other patients received hearts from patients with a BMI classifying them as overweight (35 percent of total donors), obese (15 percent) or extremely obese (9 percent).</p> <p>The researchers found no significant difference in overall survival among the four groups.</p> <p>Dr. Michael Givertz, a Harvard Medical School professor who was not involved in either study but wrote an editorial that accompanied the report about hepatitis C donors, said both studies examine \"this large potential opportunity to access donor organs that would otherwise not be used.\"</p> <p> He said more research is needed to explore the impact of using hearts from donors with hepatitis C, but overall both studies offer tremendous potential and promise.</p> <p>\"There are patients who never make it to transplant because they die on the waiting list. And there are opportunities here to offer them an organ and a successful transplantation,\" said Givertz, medical director of the heart transplant and mechanical circulatory support program at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.</p> <p>The key is educating patients about the potential risks of using unconventional donors and weighing those risks against waiting even longer, possibly indefinitely, on the transplant list.</p> <p>\"Once the recipient and their families understand the relative balance of these risks, I've found, and many colleagues have found, that most people are willing to move forward,\" Givertz said.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Dec. 4, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Exposure to chemicals found in a wide array of personal care products has been linked to early puberty among girls, a new investigation warns.</p><p>The issue centers on specific chemicals including phthalates, parabens and phenols. They're found in an array of products, including perfumes, soaps, shampoos, nail polish, cosmetics, toothpaste, lipstick, hairsprays and skin lotions -- to name just a few.</p><p>These chemicals \"get into our bodies either by absorption through the skin, by being inhaled, or being ingested [like lipstick],\" explained study author Kim Harley. \"Once they are in the body, they are quite quickly metabolized and [then] excreted in urine.\"</p><p>Harley is associate director of the Center for Environmental Research and Children's Health at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p>As to how routine exposure to the chemicals might affect puberty, she said they've \"been shown to mimic estrogen in certain laboratory conditions.\"</p><p>In fact, prior animal studies have suggested that exposure can throw puberty timing out of whack, Harley said.</p><p>Now, her team found that \"the  higher the levels of the chemicals in mothers' or daughters' bodies, the earlier the puberty\" among girls. No such link was found for the timing of male puberty, however. </p><p>\"We were a little surprised that the associations were only with girls and we didn't see much with boys,\" Harley said. \"But since these tend to be estrogenic chemicals, it makes sense that they might impact girls.\"</p><p>To explore the issue, investigators analyzed data collected in a study that enrolled pregnant women between 1999 and 2000. The women had blood tests twice throughout their pregnancy, and interviews were also conducted to gauge exposure to the chemicals in question.</p><p>Nine in 10 of all the urine samples taken from the expectant moms tested positive for chemicals that fall into one of the three chemical classes of concern, with slightly lower percentages (about seven in 10) with respect to a chemical called triclosan. An antimicrobial, triclosan was banned for use in soap by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2017, but it can still be found in some toothpastes, the researchers noted.</p><p>In the study, the scientists tracked 338 of the women's offspring through adolescence, with urine samples analyzed at the age of 9. Onset of puberty was then checked regularly between the ages of 9 and 13.</p><p>The researchers determined that for every doubling of a woman's blood level of phthalates, the development of her daughter's pubic hair started 1.3 months earlier than usual.</p><p>A doubling of a mother's triclosan levels was also linked to a one-month earlier start of her daughter's first period, the study found.</p><p>Blood tests were also take of the children themselves. Harley's group found that a doubling of paraben levels in girls was linked to the one-month earlier onset of both breast and pubic hair development.</p><p>Harley stressed that the findings are \"definitely not\" absolute proof that such chemical exposure actually causes early puberty among girls. \"There is always the possibility that there were confounding factors that we were not able to control, or that our findings were due to chance,\" she explained.</p><p>\"That said, our findings are consistent with what we know about the endocrine-disrupting properties of these chemicals,\" said Harley. \"So, although we are not ready to say that early life exposure to these chemicals causes earlier puberty in girls, we have enough evidence to be concerned.\"</p><p>The findings were published in the Dec. 4 issue of the journal <i>Human Reproduction</i>.</p><p>An industry group said the study had limitations.</p><p>\"Levels were determined in the mothers' urine by measurement of a single sample at each of two time points during pregnancy. In the children, levels were determined in a single sample taken at age 9,\" noted Linda Loretz, chief toxicologist at the Personal Care Products Council.</p><p>\"Patterns of exposure may have varied greatly over the course of pregnancy in the mothers, and between the ages of 9 and 13 in the boys and girls, so the representativeness of the exposure levels is unknown,\" she added.</p><p>\"Furthermore, as phthalates, parabens and phenols are all rapidly excreted from the body, measured levels will change not just over months and years, but over the course of a single day, so that any given measurement reflects only a specific moment in time,\" she added.</p><p>Last but not least, \"the researchers also acknowledge exposure to other environmental chemicals, such as pesticides encountered during farm working, might also affect the results,\" Loretz concluded.</p><p>But one other expert said the findings aren't so surprising.</p><p>Dr. Margaret Cuomo is a board-certified radiologist who formerly served as an attending physician in diagnostic radiology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y. She said \"many previous studies have reported the association between the chemicals that are called 'endocrine disruptors' and human health\".</p><p>As to what consumers can do, Cuomo suggested checking out the website of the watchdog organization Environmental Working Group. There you can \"find a list of those products that are relatively safe to use,\" meaning products that are free of parabens, phthalates, triclosan and similar chemicals.</p> <p>Cuomo also advised picking household cleaners and detergents are that \"environmentally safe,\" and opting for organic foods when possible.</p><p>\"States such as California and Washington have laws protecting consumers from harmful chemicals in a variety of products,\" she added. \"[And] New York is the first state to require disclosure of harmful chemicals by manufacturers of household cleaning agents. Hopefully, New York State's initiative will be extended soon to include many other consumer products.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on puberty at the <a href=\"https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/puberty\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</a>.</p>",

It was generally believed that Parkinson's did not affect life expectancy, but recent studies have found a somewhat shorter life span for people with the disease.</p><p>Seeking clarification, Backstrom's team looked at 182 patients newly diagnosed with Parkinson's disease or other types of parkinsonism. The study patients were followed for nearly 14 years.</p><p>The patients' mental abilities (thinking and memory skills) were tested at the start of the study period and annually after that. During the study, 109 participants died. </p><p>Those who had problems with memory and thinking skills (mild cognitive impairment) at the start of the study were more than twice as likely to die during the follow-up period than people who didn't have these problems, the investigators found.</p><p>Average age at the study's start was about 71 for people with Parkinson's disease. Expected survival for people with no mild cognitive impairment was nearly 12 years, compared with just over 8 years for those with mild cognitive impairment, the findings showed.</p><p>Multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy are two types of parkinsonism likely to affect thinking and memory. People with these diseases had a shortened life expectancy, with a death rate more than three times higher than that of the general population, the researchers reported.</p><p>In all, 54 percent of people with Parkinson's died during the study period, compared with 89 percent of those with progressive supranuclear palsy and 92 percent of those with multiple system atrophy, according to the report.</p><p> The study authors said that expected survival was six years for people with progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system atrophy.</p> <p> Backstrom and his team pointed out that other factors that appeared early in the disease were associated with a shorter life span. They included brief episodes where people were unable to walk or lost their sense of smell.</p><p>One limitation of the study was that only five autopsies were performed to confirm the diagnoses.

The more laws there are, the fewer deaths there are,\" Chao said.</p><p>Lax firearms laws, in particular, create an increased risk for suicide among children, the researchers found.</p><p>Laws that limit children's access to guns -- requirements for locking mechanisms on guns, keeping firearms in locked boxes or safes, and storing guns separate from ammunition -- protected kids from suicide, the study found.</p><p>\"States that didn't have any laws designed to specifically protect children had four times the pediatric suicide death rate as states that had laws that both required safe gun storage and said you can't provide a gun to a child,\" Chao said.</p><p>She and her colleagues compared federal statistics on child gun-related deaths with a scorecard maintained by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. The group rates gun law stringency state-by-state.</p><p>Arizona has the loosest guns laws, while California is the strictest, according to the Brady Campaign.</p><p>The study found that the link between child gun deaths and gun control laws persisted even after the researchers controlled for other factors like poverty, unemployment and substance abuse.</p><p>Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said, \"It's more evidence of what we already know, which is that guns are an independent determinant of injury and death, separate from pretty much anything else.\" </p><p>There also appeared to be a spillover effect. The safety of children in any given state was affected by the stringency of firearm legislation in neighboring states, the researchers said.</p><p>\"It's clearly access,\" said Benjamin. \"Kids are finding those firearms. And it's not just preventable shootings, where a child picked up a gun and somehow fired it. It's also suicides. This really nails the case that it's about the guns and the firearm availability.\" </p><p>Firearm laws also influence the number of gun injuries sustained by kids, according to the study.</p><p>Regions with higher average Brady scores, the Northeast and West, had 7.5 injuries per 100,000 children, the researchers said.

It's what eye doctors call a refractive error, meaning the eyes can't focus light properly. The result: Close objects look clear; distant ones, fuzzy.</p><p>It's most often caused by continuously focusing on close objects while the eyes are still developing -- as in reading, for example. But the growing use of electronic devices seems to be making the problem worse, researchers report.</p><p>\"As ever, everything should be done in moderation,\" said lead researcher Dr. Christopher Hammond, chairman of ophthalmology at King's College London in England. He urged parents to limit kids' use of electronic devices.</p><p>That appears to be especially important for kids born in the summer, the study suggests. That's because they start formal schooling at a younger age than kids born in winter so they are exposed to more reading sooner. And that increases myopia risk, the researchers said.</p><p>The researchers added that, while their study doesn't prove smartphones, tablets and computer games cause nearsightedness, those devices may lead kids to spend less time outdoors. And less time outdoors also appears to increase myopia risk. </p><p>\"We know that time outdoors is protective, and so kids should spend probably up to two hours a day outside,\" Hammond said.</p> <p>Myopia can be corrected with glasses, laser surgery or contact lenses. Later in life, however, sufferers are more likely to develop sight-robbing conditions such as cataracts or glaucoma, the researchers said.</p><p>Experts predict that by 2050, nearly 5 billion people worldwide will have myopia. That compares to about 2 billion in 2010.</p><p>Genes have been linked to a person's risk for the condition, but even if it has a genetic component, that doesn't account for the dramatic increase, Hammond said.</p><p>For the study, his team collected data on nearly 2,000 twins born in the United Kingdom between 1994 and 1996. </p><p>The researchers reviewed results of eye tests, as well as social, economic, educational and behavioral data on the twins between the ages of 2 and 16. They also had questionnaires completed by parents and teachers. </p><p>On average, children started wearing glasses for myopia at age 11. About 5 percent had amblyopia (\"lazy eye\"), and about 4.5 percent had a squint. Overall, 26 percent of the twins were nearsighted, the study found.</p><p>Kids who had college-educated mothers, those who were born in summer months and those who spent more time using electronic devices had a higher likelihood of nearsightedness, the study found. </p><p>The findings were published online Nov. 6 in the <i>British Journal of Ophthalmology</i>.</p><p>Dr. Tien Wong, medical director of the Singapore National Eye Center, is co-author of an editorial that accompanied the study.</p><p>\"Evidence supports a link between device screen time and myopia, which includes time on phones and tablets,\" he said.</p><p>This is concerning in view of how many young kids have access to these devices, Wong said. Evidence shows 2-year-olds spend up to two hours a day using digital devices.</p><p>\"Managing your child's device screen time and increasing their outdoor play can help reduce the risk of developing myopia,\" Wong said. \"We must better monitor our children's device activities, even during their preschool years.\"</p><p>Surprisingly, the researchers said children born as a result of fertility treatment had a 25 percent to 30 percent lower risk for myopia. They said that may be because many are born premature and have developmental delays, which could account for shorter eye length and less myopia.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>To learn more about myopia, visit the <a href=\"https://nei.nih.gov/health/errors/myopia\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. National Eye Institute</a>.</p>",

Our results so far suggest that this is a gradual, rather than a sudden, shift,\" lead researcher Disa Sauter said in a Canadian Acoustical Association news release. </p><p>This shift doesn't seem to be linked to any particular developmental milestones.</p><p>The vocal control developed as people learn to speak may be why humans are the lone primates that laugh only when they exhale, Sauter said. She's a psychologist and associate professor at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands.</p><p>Researchers are now investigating if there's a link between the amount of laughter produced on the inhale and exhale and the reasons people laugh, which also change with age. In infants, laughter is tied to physical play like tickling. In older people, laughter is triggered by physical play as well as social interactions.</p><p>\"Beyond that, I'd be interested in seeing whether our findings apply to other vocalizations than laughter,\" Sauter said.</p><p>This research could lead to new insight about vocal production in children with developmental disorders.</p><p>\"If we know what normally developing babies sound like, it could be interesting to study infants at risk to see whether there are very early signs of atypical development in their nonverbal vocalizations of emotion,\" Sauter explained.</p><p>The study is scheduled for presentation Wednesday at a Canadian Acoustical Association meeting in Victoria, British Columbia. Research presented at meetings is typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Helpguide. org has more on <a href=\"https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-health/laughter-is-the-best-medicine.htm\" target=\"_new\">laughter</a>.</p>",

The season also was associated with a higher chance of patients dying during their hospital stay.</p> <p>But after adjusting for various factors, including regional climate and patient demographics and medical history, the wintertime increase didn't prove to be as significant, researchers reported in the Yale University-led study published Friday in the <i>Journal of the American Heart Association</i>.</p> <p>\"What that told us was that there's something about winter, rather than simply the season itself, that was mediating this relationship. And the strong variables there turned out to be temperature and precipitation,\" said Dr. Stacy Chu, the study's lead author and a clinical fellow in the neurocritical care and emergency neurology division of the Yale School of Medicine in Connecticut.</p> <p>The study examined data on 457,638 people who had a stroke. Researchers also gathered daily climate records for the nation's nine regions to get the temperature and precipitation level, not including snowfall, on the day of hospital admission, as well as averages over the seven days before hospitalization. </p> <p>The warmer and wetter weather found in spring and summer was associated with a better chance of survival and overall better outcome after a stroke, the study showed. </p> <p>The research, which was funded by the American Heart Association, did not address why more strokes happen in the winter or reasons behind the association between weather and how well people recover. But the investigators noted that previous research has shown that blood pressure and other cardiovascular risks go up during the winter. </p> <p>One main reason that happens is because blood vessels constrict in cold weather to help the body conserve heat, said Dr. Carolyn Brockington, director of the Stroke Center at Mount Sinai West and Mount Sinai St. Luke's hospitals in New York City.</p> <p>\"Think of blood vessels going to the brain almost like plumbing, and the pipes are getting smaller, with less blood getting to the brain. So, it might in some way precipitate an event like a stroke or heart attack,\" said Brockington, who was not part of the new study.</p> <p>People may also easily become dehydrated during the winter because they don't think about drinking water and other fluids as often as they do in warmer months, she said. Dehydration can lead to thicker blood, which can be more prone to clotting.</p> <p>Strokes are generally viewed as preventable, Brockington said. While some risk factors for stroke can't be changed, such as age and family history, most others can be treated or controlled any time of the year. </p> <p>\"If you have high blood pressure, many times that means diet changes, exercise and sometimes medication. If you have diabetes, the same thing. If you smoke, you can learn ways to stop,\" Brockington said. </p> <p>The study may offer another modifiable risk factor for stroke, she added.</p> <p>\"The message is, partner with your doctor and go through your own individual risk factors and modify them appropriately,\" she said. \"That's extremely important whether it's winter, spring, summer or fall.\"</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 2, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Ruling against the recommendation of one of its chief experts, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved an extremely potent new opioid painkiller, Dsuvia.</p><p>The drug is a 30-microgram pill that packs the same punch as 5 milligrams of intravenous morphine, according to the <i>Washington Post</i>. The tiny pill comes packaged in a syringe-like applicator and would be used under the tongue for quick absorption.  Dsuvia (sufentanil) will be marketed by California-based maker AcelRX.</p><p>The drug is for very restricted use in operating rooms or on the battlefield. Indeed, its potential use by soldiers was one reason Dsuvia was approved, according to FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb.</p><p>\"The FDA has made it a high priority to make sure our soldiers have access to treatments that meet the unique needs of the battlefield, including when intravenous administration is not possible for the treatment of acute pain,\" Gottlieb said in an agency news release.</p><p>But Dsuvia's approval comes amid controversy, with an epidemic of opioid abuse continuing to ravage the United States. Experts worry that supplies of the drug will somehow make their way from doctors' offices and pharmacies to addicts.</p><p>An FDA advisory committee did recommend for approval of Dsuvia in a 10-3 vote last month.  But the committee's chair took the highly unusual move of voicing his opposition at that time. Dr. Raeford Brown, a professor of anesthesiology and pediatrics at the University of Kentucky, urged the FDA to reject the drug.</p><p>\"I am very disappointed with the decision of the agency to approve Dsuvia. This action is inconsistent with the charter of the agency,\" Brown said in a statement Friday. \"I will continue to hold the agency accountable for their response to the worst public health problem since the 1918 influenza epidemic.\"</p><p>The consumer watchdog group Public Citizen has also come out strongly against approval. In a statement issued Friday, the group contended that, \"if approved, Dsuvia will be abused and start killing people as soon as it hits the market.\"</p><p>Public Citizen described the drug as \"five to 10 times more potent than fentanyl and 1,000 times more potent than morphine.\"</p><p>But Gottlieb stressed Friday that his agency has placed very tight restrictions on Dsuvia.</p><p>\"To address concerns about the potential risks associated with Dsuvia, this product will have strong limitations on its use,\" Gottlieb said. \"It can't be dispensed to patients for home use and should not be used for more than 72 hours. And it should only be administered by a health care provider using a single-dose applicator. That means it won't be available at retail pharmacies for patients to take home.\"</p><p>The drug is also only for use by patients who cannot tolerate other painkillers, or for whom other painkillers have failed or are expected to fail.</p><p>The United States continues to struggle with the opioid abuse epidemic.  On Friday, new statistics released by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration found the number of opioid overdose deaths in the United States reached a new record last year with 72,000 deaths -- about 200 per day.</p><p>And even as his agency gave the nod to Dsuvia, Gottlieb said other steps are being taken to restrict access to highly potent opioids.</p><p>\"The agency is taking new steps to more actively confront this crisis, while also paying careful attention to the needs of patients and physicians managing pain,\" he said. Part of that effort may be a closer and more stringent assessment of the need for new opioid formulations going forward, Gottlieb added.</p><p>\"To that end, I've asked the professional staff at the FDA to evaluate a new framework for opioid analgesic approvals,\" he said. Already, it's clear that in the context of the opioid crisis, \"our evaluation of opioids is different than how we assess drugs in other therapeutic classes,\" Gottlieb noted.</p><p>As for Dsuvia, even after approval, \"the FDA will continue to carefully monitor the implementation of the [regulatory safeguards] associated with Dsuvia and compliance with its requirements, and we'll work to quickly make regulatory adjustments if problems arise,\" Gottlieb said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>There's more on pain control at the  <a href=\"https://www.asahq.org/whensecondscount/pain-management/\" target=\"_new\">American Society of Anesthesiologists</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 5, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Otherwise healthy women diagnosed with postpartum depression may be at higher risk of a heart attack, stroke or heart failure, a new study suggests.</p><p>Acting on mounting evidence linking clinical depression to cardiovascular disease, researchers sought to explore whether other forms of depression might also increase the risk for conditions affecting the heart or brain.</p> <p>They examined a registry of 1.8 million California women who did not have a history of cardiovascular disease or chronic depression. Of those women, 40,276 were diagnosed with postpartum depression.</p><p>Within roughly five years of giving birth, the women who had postpartum depression had a nearly 70 percent higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease, including heart attack, stroke and heart failure. And that was even after adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes and high blood pressure, pregnancy-related conditions such as preeclampsia, and social and behavioral factors such as smoking, alcohol use and insurance access.</p><p>The findings will be presented Nov. 11 at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions meeting in Chicago.</p> <p>What's causing these women to be more at risk is uncertain, said Dr. Punag Divanji, the study's lead researcher and a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco.</p><p>Among the possibilities is a link to the drop in estrogen and progesterone after childbirth. These two hormones increase exponentially during pregnancy, and women with postpartum depression may have a greater decline in levels after childbirth than other new mothers.</p><p>But more research needs to be conducted before actual causal reasons can be pinned down, Divanji said.</p> <p>\"There's still a lot of work to be done in terms of better understanding cardiovascular risk in women,\" he said, particularly risk factors other than high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.</p> <p>Dr. Leslie Cho, director of the Women's Cardiology Center at The Cleveland Clinic, agreed that more research would help validate the findings, as well as shed light on the mechanics behind them.</p><p>\"What we do know is that if you're depressed, straight-up depressed, you tend to eat badly. You tend to drink. If you're depressed, you don't tend to exercise,\" said Cho, was not connected with the new study. \"It goes with so many other unhealthy lifestyle choices.\"</p> <p>Past studies have shown a link between clinical depression and its impact on cardiovascular disease, including high blood pressure, Cho said.</p><p>\"It's been linked with platelet reactivity -- your platelets are more sticky when you're depressed,\" meaning there's a greater chance they could clump and form a blot clot, she said. \"So, there are all sorts of interesting heart-brain connections there.\"</p> <p>She noted that women of all ages should consider having their cardiovascular risk assessed anyway because heart disease is the leading cause of death for women.</p><p>Divanji said he hopes the study will help raise awareness about the potential link between all types of depression and cardiovascular disease.</p><p>\"This level of evidence isn't sufficient enough to say we need to sound the alarm but rather, this is something to be aware of and think more about,\" he said. \"When we see patients, we should be cognizant that depression plays a role in future cardiovascular disease risk.\"</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 5, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- New research shows that electronic cigarettes contain chemicals that cause heart damage, adding to the growing list of concerns about their safety.</p> <p>The study, which will be presented Nov. 12 at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions meeting in Chicago, investigated the effect that e-cigarettes have on the endothelial cells that line the inside of the body's blood vessels. Endothelial cells produce nitric oxide, a molecule that helps keep blood vessels healthy and control blood pressure levels.</p> <p>Chemicals in traditional cigarettes decrease the production of nitric oxide, which is one of the reasons smoking causes heart damage. The new study was designed to see if e-cigarettes have a similar effect.</p><p> The researchers collected blood samples from 36 tobacco users, e-cigarette users and nonsmokers. In the lab, they exposed blood vessel endothelial cells to the volunteers' blood serum. The serum is the liquid that remains after the red and white blood cells, blood platelets and clotting factors have been removed.</p><p>The lab results showed that endothelial cells exposed to blood serum from e-cigarette users produced less nitric oxide and contained less of the enzyme that produces nitric oxide compared to serum from nonsmokers.</p> <p>\"We showed that blood serum from electronic cigarette users has harmful effects that are similar to that of (tobacco) cigarettes on endothelial cell functions,\" said the study's lead researcher, Dr. Leila Mohammadi, a postdoctoral fellow at the Cardiovascular Research Institute at the University of California, San Francisco. \"This harmful effect is likely to adversely affect arteries and cardiovascular health.\"</p> <p>Matthew Springer, the study's principal investigator, said the findings highlight another safety concern related to e-cigarettes.</p> <p>\"You have various products (like e-cigarettes) that are assumed to be safer than cigarettes, and they might be, but safer isn't the same thing as harmless,\" said Springer, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.</p> <p>Aruni Bhatnagar, a professor of medicine at the University of Louisville and co-director of the heart association's Tobacco Regulation and Addiction Center, called the study \"a step in the right direction.\"</p> <p>\"There is a push from the tobacco industry to say e-cigarettes are safer,\" said Bhatnagar, who was not involved with the research. \"But this study raises a flag and supports the idea that e-cigarettes are not harmless to cardiovascular health. There is significant (blood vessel) injury that might be associated with long-term e-cigarette use.\"</p><p>It is not known what substance contained in e-cigarettes caused the decrease in nitric oxide, the researchers noted.</p> <p>Mohammadi and Springer both said they'd like to see future studies that look at the health of actual endothelial cells in the blood vessels of e-cigarette users. They would also like to see studies that look at the effects of the specific ingredients and flavors in e-cigarettes, including nicotine, propylene glycol and glycerin.</p> <p>\"All of the different flavors are a different chemical, and some of them could have harmful effects,\" Springer said.</p> <p>One big challenge facing researchers is the constant introduction of new e-cigarette products, each with its own list of ingredients, that are marketed as smart alternatives to smoking.</p> <p>The research is showing \"that anything you inhale other than clean air seems to be causing vascular problems,\" said Springer. \"Rather than try to find the things to inhale that aren't as bad as cigarettes, we might have to realize (we need) to just breathe clean air.\"</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 9, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Women confused by the conflicting advice surrounding the benefits and timing of mammograms will be interested in a new study out of Sweden.</p><p>The research, involving more than 50,000 breast cancer patients, found that those who took part in a breast cancer screening program had a 60 percent lower risk of dying from the disease in the 10 years after diagnosis, and a 47 percent lower risk 20 years after diagnosis.</p><p>\"This is really what we've been waiting for because there has been so much hoopla about mammography not reducing the death rate from breast cancer,\" said Dr. Lauren Cassell, chief of breast surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. She was not involved with the study.</p><p>Many people have said it's better treatment, and not screening, that has improved survival, Cassell explained.</p><p>\"But when you do pick up cancers earlier, patients do better,\" she said. \"We've had a gut feeling that early detection makes a difference, and now we can prove it.\"</p><p>Study co-author Robert Smith, vice president for cancer screening at the American Cancer Society, said, \"The advantage of screening is that it offers a woman, if she develops breast cancer, the opportunity to treat that cancer early when the treatment can be less aggressive and when she has more treatment choices.\"</p><p>Finding cancer in an early stage may also avoid aggressive treatments that can diminish quality of life, he added.</p><p>\"Mammography today, in the setting of modern therapy, confers a substantial benefit to women who attend regular screening,\" Smith said. \"The mortality reductions we observe are principally due to mammography detecting the most aggressive cancers early.\"</p><p>While the findings may seem obvious, the effect of mammograms on survival is something that's been debated in recent years.</p><p>The American Cancer Society recommends annual breast cancer screening for women aged 45 to 54, while the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends mammograms every other year for women aged 50 to 74.</p><p>The task force says the evidence for earlier screening isn't convincing, but women should make that decision on an individual basis.</p><p>Part of the discrepancy is caused by how the evidence is gathered, Smith explained.</p><p>Much of the data that has gone into making recommendations came from older studies that weren't able to clearly break out the benefit of early screening on survival, he said.</p><p>Early screening finds cancers that wouldn't show symptoms for years, Smith said. Also, survival from breast cancer can get confused with improvements in treatment, making it hard to tease out the benefit of screening, he added.</p><p>For the new study, researchers were able to take advantage of highly detailed Swedish data that spanned 52 years. This enabled the researchers to look at data from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, when widespread screening didn't exist, and 39 years later, when widespread screening was available.</p><p>What's more, the data for the new study were \"individualized\" -- so researchers could look at the outcome of every woman in the registry who had breast cancer and whether she was screened or not. This enabled Smith's team to pinpoint the effect of screening on survival.</p> <p>The researchers also were able to quantify the benefit of screening by looking at deaths after diagnosis.</p><p>\"The latest study adds to the large body of literature that demonstrates early detection of breast cancer through screening programs saves the most lives,\" said Dr. Nicole Saphier, director of breast imaging at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Monmouth Regional, in Middletown, N.J.</p><p>Breast cancers in women aged 40 to 49 tend to grow faster than breast cancers in older women, she said. \"This means mammography and early detection are essential in these women, when the chances of survival are highest,\" she added.</p><p>For the study, Smith and his colleagues collected data on more than 52,400 women aged 40 to 69 in Dalarna, Sweden. All were diagnosed with breast cancer between 1977 and 2015. All the patients received the latest treatment for their stage of cancer, regardless of how it was found.</p><p>Dr. Jay Baker is president of the Society of Breast Imaging. In a society news release, he said that, \"The conclusion of this study could not be more clear -- modern treatments are important but not solely sufficient. Women who get regular screening mammograms cut their risk of dying of breast cancer by about half.\"</p><p>The findings were published online Nov. 8 in the journal <i>Cancer</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>To learn more about breast cancer screening, visit the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/special-coverage/american-cancer-society-breast-cancer-screening-guidelines.html\" target=\"_new\"> American Cancer Society</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 13, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- People who overdose on opioids have one lifeline, the drug naloxone, but two new studies find that many pharmacies won't offer this lifesaving antidote without a doctor's blessing.</p><p>Though many states have passed laws mandating that naloxone be made available without a prescription, researchers from California found that fewer than 25 percent of pharmacies in that state would give the drug without a prescription. And in the second study from Texas, investigators found that although 8 in 10 drugstores would dispense the drug, less than 7 in 10 had naloxone in stock.</p><p>Why? A lack of training, a lack of desire to make room for the drug on their shelves, and outright moral objections to giving an opioid user a medication that might encourage drug abuse, the scientists said.</p><p>\"We have an opioid crisis in our country, and we have a large number of opioid overdose deaths, about half of which are due to prescription opioids,\" said Talia Puzantian, lead researcher of the first study, and associate professor of clinical sciences at Keck Graduate Institute School of Pharmacy and Health Sciences in Claremont, Calif.</p> <p>People getting prescriptions for these narcotic painkillers may not think they are at risk for overdosing, she said. \"But these drugs have significant safety issues,\" Puzantian said.</p><p>Part of a pharmacist's role is to educate patients about the dangers of opioids and make naloxone available when they think the patients may be at risk for an overdose, she said. These include people who are taking high doses of the painkillers or are mixing them with other drugs that can increase the risk.</p><p>Since 2016, California law has allowed pharmacists to provide naloxone without a prescription.</p><p>For the California study, Puzantian and her colleagues called more than 1,100 pharmacies asking if they would provide naloxone without a physician's prescription. Fewer than 25 percent said they would. Of those, only about 50 percent stocked nasal spray naloxone, the researchers found.</p><p>Puzantian said that pharmacists need to be taught about the law allowing them to give patients naloxone without a prescription.</p><p>In addition, they need to have the drug on hand. Many pharmacies that don't stock naloxone said they didn't have the shelf space, given all the other more popular drugs they need to carry and the low demand for naloxone.</p><p>Some pharmacists have a moral objection to providing drugs to opioid users, Puzantian said. They believe that it only encourages drug abuse, but that's not the case, she said.</p><p>\"Opioid overdoses don't only occur in people using heroin, so patients should talk with their pharmacists about whether they are at risk for overdose and whether they might be a good candidate for having naloxone on hand,\" Puzantian said.</p><p>In the second study, researchers led by Kirk Evoy, a clinical assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin, studied the availability of naloxone at chain pharmacies in the state. Texas also allows pharmacists to provide the drug without a prescription. </p><p>Of the 2,300 drugstores contacted, 84 percent said they would provide the drug, but only 69 percent had it on their shelves. The nasal spray form of the drug was the one most commonly available, the researchers found.</p><p>In drugstores that had the drug in stock and would provide it without a prescription, patients could walk into the pharmacy without having seen a doctor and obtain naloxone the same day in approximately 70 percent of the chain pharmacies contacted, Evoy said. </p><p>Although chain stores like CVS and Walmart stock naloxone, more need to make the drug available, he said.</p><p>\"Hopefully, this study serves as a call to action for community pharmacies to better educate their pharmacists and support staff regarding naloxone access laws and company policies regarding naloxone dispensing,\" Evoy said.</p><p>Dr. Sandeep Kapoor, director of screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment at Northwell Health in New Hyde Park, N.Y., said the public also needs to be educated about naloxone.</p><p>\"We need to encourage education for the community, schools and hospitals to relieve apprehensions one may feel in going directly to a pharmacy to get naloxone,\" said Kapoor, who was not involved with the studies.</p><p>It might be that people feel uncomfortable asking for naloxone because of fear or the stigma associated with opioid use, he said.</p><p>\"We should continue identifying barriers to utilization and focus efforts to further normalize and destigmatize substance use disorder,\" Kapoor said. </p><p>The reports were published Nov. 13 in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/index.html\" target=\"_new\">opioid overdoses</a>.</p>",

This will let you easily see how much of a day's worth of sugar you're eating in every portion, the kind of information we already have about fat, sodium and other nutrients. However, the deadline for manufacturers to include this information has been extended to 2020, so it's still up to you to scrutinize labels for now.</p><p>Sugars added to processed foods aren't physiologically different from the naturally occurring sugars in fruit for instance. But unlike fruit -- and other nutrient-rich foods -- sugary processed foods often lead to overeating. For example, most people don't overdo berries, but do overdo sugar-sweetened drinks, cookies and other desserts. In fact, about half our added sugar intake is from sweetened beverages like soda, energy-, sports- and juice drinks.</p><p>Many used to worry only about tooth decay from sugar. Now we know there's a relationship between excess sugar, weight gain and chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><p>Limiting sugar to 10 percent of daily calories means capping daily intake at 6 teaspoons for women and 9 teaspoons for men. Since current labels do state total sugar content in grams, with a little math, you can get a good idea of how much sugar you're taking in.</p><p>Four grams of sugar roughly equals 1 teaspoon. So just divide the sugar grams in a food portion by 4 to estimate the number of teaspoons it has, then keep a running total each day. And remember that just one can of soda with 40 grams of sugar equals 10 teaspoons -- more than a day's worth.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The University of California, San Francisco program SugarScience has a list of all <a href=\"http://sugarscience.ucsf.edu/hidden-in-plain-sight/#.W1MUOC2ZNsM\" target=\"_new\">ingredient names for sugar</a> to increase your label-reading savvy.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Dec. 5, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- A new mint-sized, battery-free patch that alerts wearers to potentially harmful sunlight exposure in real time might become a powerful weapon in preventing skin cancer.</p><p>Powered by the sun while designed to measure its rays, the patch automatically transmits sun readings to a user's smartphone. It works wet or dry, is fully reusable, and weighs next to nothing.</p><p>\"In the U.S., we're in a skin cancer epidemic, which is driven by excessive UV exposure,\" noted study author Dr. Steve (Shuai) Xu. He is a dermatology instructor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.</p><p>\"Thus, this technology would be useful for the majority of individuals by empowering them to know how much UV they are actually getting,\" he said.</p><p>So, what does it look like and how does it work?</p><p>Xu said the device weighs less than a single tic tac, is half the diameter of a dime, and thinner than a credit card.</p><p>What's more, \"the devices are virtually indestructible,\" said Xu. \"We've washed them, dunked them in boiling water. They will last forever.\"</p><p>As to function, Xu said a solar-powered sensor embedded in the patch picks up UV, infrared and/or visible light readings, sending exposure numbers wirelessly to the wearer's smartphone app.</p><p>Caregivers could also use the patch to monitor blue light phototherapy when treating jaundice (in newborns), psoriasis and/or atopic dermatitis,  Xu explained.</p><p>But the prized benefit is that \"we're able to give actionable, accurate information to the user\" about sun exposure in real time, he noted. In fact, his team's earlier work with a sensor prototype found that nearly two-thirds of patch users got fewer sunburns, while roughly one-third said they wore more sunscreen and looked for more shade.</p><p>\"We're expecting even better results with this sensor,\" Xu said. \"It's more accurate and sensitive than anything else out there.\"</p><p>Xu is also medical director for Northwestern's Center for Bio-Integrated Electronics.</p><p>In the study, two outdoor UV patch trials involving more than 10 participants per experiment were conducted in the sunny locales of Rio de Janeiro and St. Petersburg, Fla. In addition, blue light therapy patch trials were conducted in three babies undergoing neonatal care in a hospital setting.</p><p>The cosmetics company L'Oreal contributed research funding (along with the U.S. National Cancer Institute and the U.S. National Institutes of Health), and has recently launched a UVA-monitoring version of the patch for consumers.</p><p>On the downside, the trials highlighted a \"fundamental limitation\" of the patch: Given that not all parts of the body get the same degree of sun exposure, the small detection area of the patch means that readings may not truly represent sun exposure across the full surface of the body.</p><p>But the results indicated that the patch was easily wearable on those parts of the body that might be of \"critical\" sun exposure interest, including the shoulders and ears. It could even be placed on a pair of sunglasses, the researchers noted.</p><p>The findings were published Dec. 5  in  the journal <i>Science Translational Medicine</i>.</p><p>Arielle Grabel, public relations manager for the Skin Cancer Foundation in New York City, pointed to the foundation's cautionary position statement on the device.</p><p>The foundation \"can't speak to the technology and reliability of these [wearable] devices,\" the statement read. </p><p>The group also warned \"against relying on these devices to determine when to take sun protection measures. Rather, the Skin Cancer Foundation counsels the public to consider sun protection a healthy habit to be practiced daily. This includes seeking shade during peak sun hours, covering up with clothing, hats and sunglasses, and applying sunscreen daily. When spending time outdoors, sunscreen should be reapplied every two hours or immediately after swimming or sweating,\" the statement concluded.</p><p>Each year, there are 5.4 million new cases of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin in the United States, alongside 178,000 new cases of melanoma, resulting in an estimated 9,000 deaths, the investigators noted.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more about sun protection at the <a href=\"https://www.skincancer.org/prevention/sun-protection\" target=\"_new\">Skin Cancer Foundation</a>.</p>",

(Cardiac arrest is when your heart suddenly stops beating.) </p><p>The study also found an average drop in yearly earnings of more than $13,000 after a stroke, about $11,000 after cardiac arrest and nearly $4,000 after a heart attack. </p><p>\"When we look at the impact of health events, we need to look not only at short-term, easy-to-measure outcomes like life and death. Quality of life and economic well-being are equally important to people,\" said study author Dr. Allan Garland. He is a professor of medicine and community health sciences at the University of Manitoba and Health Sciences Centre Winnipeg in Canada.</p><p> Garland said that most people want to work, so it's important to figure out who's most likely to lose their ability to work and earn. Then, he added, \"we need policies from government and employers to try to help these people get back to work and be more productive.\"</p><p>Serious health events like heart attacks, cardiac arrest and strokes can be life-altering, the study authors noted. These conditions may lead to a loss in some abilities, which might make it difficult to return to work or to return to work full-time. </p><p>One-third of heart attacks, 40 percent of cardiac arrests and one-quarter of strokes occur in people who are 65  or younger, according to the report. </p><p>To see what impact these events had on people's working lives, the researchers were able to use a Canadian database that links hospital records and tax return information. They looked at data from 2005 to 2013.</p><p>The investigators looked for people who had experienced a heart attack, cardiac arrest or stroke who had been working during the two years before their health event. They were all between the ages of 40 and 61. </p><p>Garland's team compared these groups to a much larger group of similar healthy people, and looked at the three-year period after the serious health event. </p><p>\"These kinds of unemployment and lost earnings have broad consequences across society. In the United States, it can lead to a loss of health insurance and lead to the phenomenon of medical bankruptcy. Those costs are borne by governments and employers,\" Garland said.</p><p>Dr. Terrence Sacchi, chief of cardiology at NewYork-Presbyterian Methodist Hospital in New York City, said that someone who has had a heart attack has a much better chance of returning to work than someone who is much sicker, such as someone who's had a stroke or cardiac arrest.</p><p> Sacchi said the study shows the need to stress prevention. </p><p>\"Modify all the risk factors you can. If you have diabetes, treat it. If you have high blood pressure or high cholesterol, treat it. If you smoke, quit. Eat a healthy diet and exercise to decrease the chances of this happening again,\" he advised. </p><p> Sacchi also recommended that people enter a cardiac rehabilitation program, and \"if you feel you're capable, you can get back to work.\" </p><p>The findings were published Jan. 7 in the <i>CMAJ</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about getting back to work after a stroke from the <a href=\"https://www.stroke.org/we-can-help/survivors/stroke-recovery/life-style/returning-to-work-after-a-stroke\" target=\"_new\">National Stroke Association</a>.</p>",

There was also a slight decline in the percentage of women who drank alcohol during a pregnancy -- about 8.4 percent in 2016, down from 9.6 percent in 2002, the researchers said.</p><p>The rise in marijuana use in pregnancy has been seen in other recent studies, and is troubling, said a research team led by Arpana Agrawal of the department of psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.</p><p>\"Unlike alcohol and cigarette use, prenatal cannabis use has not decreased, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy, which is a key phase of neural [brain] development for the fetus,\" the research team said.  The researchers added that the rise in pot use during pregnancy was relatively similar across various subgroups of women.</p><p>One prior study, published in August in <i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i>, suggested that some pregnant women might be turning to marijuana in hopes of easing morning sickness.</p><p>That study involved more than 220,000 U.S. women. About 5 percent said they'd used cannabis while pregnant, with use rising to more than 11 percent among women who'd complained of severe morning sickness.</p><p>The study was led by Kelly Young-Wolff, a research scientist at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, in Oakland.</p><p>Two obstetrician-gynecologists who weren't involved in either of the two studies said the pot use trends are familiar.</p><p>\"I am not surprised that marijuana use is on the rise among pregnant women,\" said Dr. Adi Davidov, who directs ob-gyn services at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City.</p><p>\"Over the past several years, marijuana use in the general population has been on the rise because of the perceived lack of risk and legalization in certain states,\" he said. \"It would follow that pregnant women would also feel the same way.\"</p><p>Dr. Jennifer Wu practices at Lenox Hill Hospital, also in New York City. She agreed that the rise in pot use during pregnancy is probably due to the fact that more Americans view cannabis as a \"benign drug.\"</p> <p>\"There needs to be better public education on the dangers to the developing fetus,\" said Wu.</p><p>According to Davidov, the effects of marijuana exposure on the developing fetus remain largely unknown.</p><p>\"There are very few studies looking at the true effects of marijuana on pregnancy outcomes,\" he said. \"Until we know the exact outcomes of marijuana use in pregnancy, all pregnant women should be advised to abstain from using it.\"</p><p>The new study was published Nov. 5 in the journal <i>JAMA Pediatrics</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has more on <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Morning-Sickness-Nausea-and-Vomiting-of-Pregnancy\" target=\"_new\">morning sickness</a>.</p>",

Non-opioid alternatives to treat opioid dependence continue to be researched and scrutinized, experts said.</p><p>The case study, published online Nov. 7 in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i>, centered on a newborn boy whose mother had a seven-year history of oxycodone use, but who had successfully completed drug rehabilitation. She had last used oxycodone two years before her baby was born, and her urine test was negative for drug use.</p><p>Kratom -- which grows naturally in the Southeast Asian countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea and Thailand -- is less potent than morphine and doesn't slow breathing. But 33 hours after his birth, the baby boy in this case study began showing symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal, including sneezing, jitteriness, excessive suck, scratching at the skin around his face, and irritability.</p> <p>His mother denied using prescription medications, supplements or illegal drugs during her pregnancy, but the baby's father reported that the mother drank kratom tea daily during pregnancy. She had bought the tea to help with sleep and her own opioid withdrawal symptoms.</p><p>Treated with morphine and a common blood pressure drug over the next several days, the boy's condition improved and he was discharged from the hospital at 8 days old.</p><p>\"Prior to this case, I was unfamiliar with kratom and unaware of its potential to be a source of withdrawal for [newborn babies],\" Eldridge said. \"After caring for this infant, I started to pay attention to how heavily kratom is advertised and realized pediatricians and obstetricians need to be familiarized with its potential to affect our patients.\"</p><p>Further research is needed to \"make an educated decision as to how to classify kratom,\" she suggested.</p><p>\"It may have a role to play in opioid dependency, [but] currently there is too little data to say what role it should be,\" Eldridge added. \"Meanwhile, pregnant women should disclose kratom use to their physicians just as they would alcohol or tobacco, and physicians have a responsibility to educate pregnant women about the potential impact of kratom for their newborn.\"</p><p>Eldridge's sentiments were echoed by Dr. Martin Chavez, chief of maternal-fetal medicine at NYU Winthrop Hospital in Mineola, N.Y.</p><p>\"I think what hit home most with this case study &hellip; is that we really have to do a thorough job inquiring what type of alternate medications -- whether over-the-counter, holistic or something being provided by a family member -- a pregnant woman may be taking,\" said Chavez.</p><p>\"The most important thing is, just because it's not being prescribed doesn't mean it's not having a potential impact [on the baby],\" he added. \"When in doubt, when you're pregnant or have a newborn, be totally open with your clinician not only about prescription medications, but any other type of medication you may be taking to alleviate symptoms you're having.\"</p> <p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse has  more on <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/kratom\" target=\"_new\">kratom</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 30, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Final exams &ndash; and the ensuing all-night study sessions they cause &ndash; are looming large for many students across the country. But reaching for energy drinks to perk up those drooping eyelids and boost study performance could do more harm than good.</p><p>Recent research shows just one energy drink can affect blood vessel function. And other studies have shown these caffeine-and-herbal concoctions can increase stress hormones and are linked to changes in blood pressure and the heart's electrical activity.</p><p>\"What I say to people who are studying is to avoid energy drinks. And to people who are exercising, avoid them,\" said Dr. John Higgins, chief of cardiology at Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital, a sports cardiologist and a professor at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth in Houston.</p><p>Higgins led a study that looked at the effects of energy drinks on blood vessel function on 44 non-smoking, healthy medical students who were in their 20s. He and his colleagues tested the students' blood vessel, or endothelial, function and then tested it again 90 minutes after they had consumed a 24-ounce energy drink.</p><p>The preliminary results, presented earlier this month at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions conference, suggest the drink reduced by about half how much the participants' blood vessels were able to dilate, or expand.</p><p>\"During exercise or under stress, your arteries have to open up because they need to get blood to the muscles, heart and brain,\" Higgins said. \"If there is impairment during exercise or mental stress, it could lead to adverse effects.\"</p><p>The market for caffeine-infused energy drinks has grown during the last decade, with new blends adding vitamins and other ingredients touting everything from memory enhancement to concentration benefits. According to research company Statista, energy drink sales reached $2.8 billion in 2016, with consistent increases since 2011. A 2016 Statista survey of 18- to 69-year-olds showed 1 in 4 people had an energy drink almost every day.</p><p>Coffee and its caffeine have gotten the green light, in moderation, from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Federal dietary guidelines published every five years as a go-to source for nutrition advice say three to five cups a day, which can be up to 400 milligrams a day of caffeine, can be part of a healthy diet.</p><p>But Higgins said energy drinks are more than just caffeine.</p><p>\"We suspect it has to do with their blends,\" he said. \"They have lots of sugar and caffeine, but also taurine, an amino acid, guaranine (from a South American plant), another source of caffeine, and they sometimes have vitamins. But they have these substances at levels in excess of the recommended daily allowance, sometimes even 10 times or more.\"</p><p>On campus, there's a common pattern, said LaVelle Hendricks, an associate professor of counseling and a student affairs coordinator at Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce, about an hour northeast of Dallas. When students are dealing with stress and lack of sleep, \"when they get close to exam time, they turn to these drinks,\" he said. \"They get this boost of energy, but then they have headaches and they crash. As a way to re-energize and get that same boost, they repeat the cycle.\"</p><p>The tough-but-true advice is there are no shortcuts.</p><p>\"You have to stick to a regimen,\" Hendricks said. \"It entails going to class, studying, eating right, exercising right and getting the proper amount of sleep.\"</p><p>A <em>Journal of American College Health</em> study in 2011 said the consumption of energy drinks has been associated with perceived stress levels of college students. Middlebury College in Vermont banned the on-campus sale of energy drinks. In Britain, many supermarkets have begun banning sales to children under 16, and the government is considering other restrictions.</p><p>Higgins said he'd like more short- and long-term studies that show how these energy drinks &ndash; and their blends of ingredients &ndash; work on the body. So far, the evidence has been inconsistent, he said, with some showing improved performance, some reduced and others no effect.</p><p>Higgins warns that some people are more at risk for the effects from energy drinks, including people under 18; people of small stature; people who don't normally drink caffeine or are sensitive to it; pregnant or breastfeeding women; people taking stimulants for conditions such as attention deficit disorder; and people with certain medical or cardiovascular conditions.</p><p>For a healthy boost during studying, Higgins suggests high-intensity exercise, or even just a quick run up and down the stairs. Getting outside, \"stretching the eyes\" with relaxed nature-watching or a power nap also can help, he said.</p><p>\"If you are really that tired and coffee isn't keeping you awake, you should probably go to sleep. You aren't going to remember anything for the test anyway.\"</p>",

But because the men went through this process only once, it's not known if the results would be the same over a long-term \"loss and catch-up\" pattern.</p><p>Meanwhile, a study of 447 people done at the University of Pittsburgh found that differences in sleep between weekdays and weekends on a regular basis resulted in higher cholesterol levels, greater insulin resistance, weight gain around the middle and a higher body mass index. And such problems can occur even if the day-to-day sleep imbalances aren't extreme.</p><p>Another study found that these changes can occur in teens, too, putting them at greater risk for diabetes at a young age.</p><p>On a positive note, a much larger study of 2,000 participants of all ages and both genders found that every hour of weekend makeup sleep helped reduce the risk for obesity, which has also been seen as a negative consequence of being sleep deprived. The findings were published in the journal <i>Sleep</i>.</p><p>Until more is learned about catch-up sleep, it's important to heed the warnings about chronic sleep loss and get 7 to 8 hours a night every night.</p><p>Make it a goal to go to bed at roughly the same time every night and wake up at the same time every morning.

Harsh verbal abuse is also linked to mental health problems in preteens and teens, according to the AAP.</p><p>One study found that children who were spanked more than twice a month at 3 years of age were more aggressive at age 5. By age 9, the negative effects of spanking were still evident, the findings showed.</p><p>Along with affecting brain development, spanking and verbal punishment can increase aggression in children in the long run and do not teach them responsibility and self-control. Other ways of teaching children right from wrong are safer and more effective, according to the AAP.</p><p>Parents should be educated on more effective discipline methods that protect children from harm, the academy recommends.</p><p>According to policy statement co-author Dr. Benjamin Siegel, \"It's best to begin with the premise of rewarding positive behavior. Parents can set up rules and expectations in advance. The key is to be consistent in following through with them.\"</p><p>Sege added: \"There's no benefit to spanking. We know that children grow and develop better with positive role modeling and by setting healthy limits. We can do better.\"</p><p>The academy recommends that pediatricians use office visits to help parents with age-appropriate strategies for handling their child's discipline. </p><p>The policy statement will be discussed at the AAP's annual meeting, which concludes Tuesday in Orlando, Fla.

She's an associate professor of nutritional health sciences and epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.</p><p>The changes that often occur with menopause, especially higher cholesterol levels and blood pressure, can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and reduced mental ability later in life, Baylin said.</p><p>\"The good news is that middle-aged women can take their well-being into their own hands and make healthy lifestyle changes, such as avoiding tobacco smoke, eating a healthier diet and getting more physical activity to reduce their cardiovascular risk,\" Baylin said in an American Heart Association news release.</p><p>For the study, Baylin and her colleagues collected data on more than 1,100 women between ages 42 and 52 who took part in a U.S. National Institute of Aging study and followed them for about 15 years. </p><p>To rate the women's lifestyle, the researchers used a special \"Healthy Lifestyle Score\" developed for the study. Women had an annual medical exam and completed questionnaires about their physical activity, eating habits and tobacco use. The participants also had at least one coronary artery ultrasound, which provided images of the inside of an artery leading to the heart.</p><p>Women with the highest scores -- the healthiest lifestyles -- had less arterial thickening. Of the three score components -- healthy diet, not smoking, and getting regular exercise -- abstinence from smoking had the strongest association with clearer arteries. </p><p>Also, the report found that only about 2 percent of the women stuck to all three parts of the Healthy Lifestyle Score throughout the study.</p><p>\"The low prevalence of a healthy lifestyle in this group of midlife women highlights the potential for lifestyle interventions aimed at this vulnerable population,\" said study co-author Dongqing Wang, also from the University of Michigan.</p><p>\"Our prospective analysis clearly suggests that women approaching menopause can significantly lower this risk if they adopt healthier behaviors, even if cardiovascular issues have never been on their radar,\" he said.</p><p>The report was published online Nov. 28 in the <i>Journal of the American Heart Association</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more information on menopause and heart disease visit the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/consumer-healthcare/menopause-and-heart-disease\" target=\"_new\"> American Heart Association</a>.</p>",

This is an increase of 18 confirmed cases from the previous week, but most of the latest confirmed cases occurred in September and October.</p><p>Even though fewer cases are expected in coming months, health officials will continue to study AFM in order to learn more about the condition in order to better diagnose, treat, and prevent it in the future, according to the CDC.</p><p>The agency noted that there is a pattern of higher numbers of confirmed cases every two years. There were 120 in 2014, 22 in 2015, 149 in 2016, and 33 in 2017.</p><p>Most cases are reported between August and October, with significant reductions in November.

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 14, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- For the billions of young people who seek community and connection on social media, new research warns their search may be in vain.</p><p>Instead, spending too much time on Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram may actually increase the risk of depression and loneliness.</p><p>So concludes a small analysis that tracked the impact such sites had on the mental health of 143 users between the ages of 18 and 22.</p> <p>Over the course of a week, some participants were told to use the sites as often as they normally would, which typically came to about  an hour a day. Others were asked to limit their usage to just 10 minutes a day per site, amounting to a total of about 25 minutes per day.</p><p>The result? \"Ours is the first study to establish that reducing social media use actually causes reductions in depression,\" said study author Melissa Hunt. She is the associate director of clinical training in the department of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>\"The main finding of the paper is that limiting your use of Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram to 30 minutes total or less per day results in reductions in depression and loneliness, especially for people who were moderately depressed to start with,\" Hunt said.</p><p>\"Our study cannot speak directly to why this happens,\" she stressed. \"But prior research strongly suggests that negative social comparison -- my life is worse than other people's lives -- and feeling left out of activities and experiences shared by others probably explains a lot of it.\"</p><p>The study team noted that 78 percent of Americans aged 18 to 24 use Snapchat, while more than seven in 10 young adults use Instagram.</p><p>Meanwhile, nearly as many American adults have a Facebook account (68 percent), and three-quarters of those say they use it every day.</p><p>All of the participants were UPenn undergraduates (108 women and 35 men) enrolled in psychology courses. All had an iPhone already loaded with all three site apps.</p><p>Participants first completed a pre-experiment survey to assess their feelings of anxiety, depression, loneliness, fear of missing out (FOMO), sense of social support, sense of self-esteem, and perceptions regarding self-acceptance and autonomy.</p><p>After tracking each participant's normal use of all three sites for a week, the team observed that, for the most part, those struggling with greater mental \"distress\" did not typically spend more time on social media.</p><p>However, those who struggled with FOMO were the exception; they did tend to spend more time using social media.</p><p>The study participants were then  randomly assigned to either unlimited or restricted access for a second week, after which mental health was re-assessed.</p><p>The results suggested that restricting social media use had a \"significant\" and beneficial impact by reducing depressive symptoms, especially among those who had been moderately or highly depressed. Time restrictions also reduced feelings of loneliness.</p><p>But the restrictions had no impact on feelings of social support, self-esteem or one's overall sense of well-being. Whether the findings would also apply to older users remains an open question, the study authors noted.</p><p>While not advocating for a total divorce from all social media, the team acknowledged that identifying the perfect sweet spot for ideal usage habits remains elusive.</p><p>The findings will be published in the December issue of the <i>Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology</i>.</p><p>Dr. Brian Primack is director of the Center for Research on Media, Technology and Health at the University of Pittsburgh.</p><p>He described the findings as \"important,\"  noting that \"because of its experimental design, this study goes an important step further [than prior research] in showing that actively reducing social media use can be helpful.\"</p><p> Primack added that linking a clear mental health benefit to a half-hour of usage per day is a helpful marker.</p><p>\"However, it is important to note that all social media use is not the same,\" said Primack. \"Thirty minutes of use may be spent connecting with loved ones, or it may focus instead on having aggressive interactions about hot-button issues. So, future research might expand findings like this by exploring different contexts of social media use.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on social media use and depression risk at <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/blog/2018/02/does-social-media-depression-in-young-people-really.html/\" target=\"_new\">RAND Corp.</a></p>",

It's exact function remains unclear, but study senior author Dr. Eddie Chang explained that the OFC \"is richly connected to various brain structures linked to mood, depression and decision making, making it very well positioned to coordinate activity between emotion and cognition.\" </p><p>Reporting Nov. 29 in <i>Current Biology</i>, the UCSF researchers suggested that the targeted therapy might help patients with treatment-resistant depression, which affects as many as 30 percent of depression patients.</p><p>One neurosurgeon who wasn't involved in the study said brain stimulation therapy for depression isn't new -- and the field has had some setbacks.</p><p>\"Brain stimulation to treat other conditions (such as Parkinson's disease) has been known for decades to have an effect on the mind,\" noted Dr. Michael Schulder. He directs neurosurgery at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y.</p><p>\"Several studies over the last 15 years, in which depressed patients had implanted brain stimulators, initially showed great promise,\" he said. In the final analysis, however, outcomes were not much better than would have been obtained with medication or psychotherapy.</p><p>But could those attempts have been targeting the wrong brain area? Chang's team wanted to find out.</p><p>Their new study involved 25 patients already enrolled in UCSF's epilepsy clinic.  Chang specializes in neurosurgery for people with the seizure disorder.  He explained that as a routine part of these surgeries, patients get electrodes temporarily implanted in their brains to help guide the surgery.</p><p>But in these 25 patients with depression, Chang's group used feedback from the electrodes to track brain activity over several days. They then linked that information to patients' changing moods, thereby pinpointing brain areas that might be amenable to stimulation therapy.</p><p>That led the investigators to the OFC, among other brain areas.  The researchers would deliver a mild electrical current to brain regions and then ask the patients about their emotional state.</p><p>Stimulation to the OFC was the clear \"winner\" here, in terms of a mood boost. What's more, stimulating that area seemed to initiate a larger response within the brain, similar to what happens naturally when a person is feeling positive.</p><p>Also, the therapy seemed to only help patients with moderate-to-severe depression, not those with milder forms of the illness.</p><p>According to study team member Dr. Vikram Rao, this suggests that \"stimulation was helping patients with serious depression experience something like a naturally positive mood state, rather than artificially boosting mood in everyone.\" </p><p>Rao, a UCSF Health neurologist, explained in the news release that prior research had suggested that OFC activity was \"elevated\" in people with depression, so the stimulation might alter the OFC in a healthy way.</p><p>Despite these promising results, the study authors said further research in larger groups of patients is needed to determine whether this therapy produces long-lasting benefits.</p><p>Dr. Vladan Novakovic directs outpatient psychiatry at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City.  He agreed that most work in electrical brain stimulation has focused on a part of the brain's cortex, while leaving other areas, such as the OFC, unexplored.</p><p>Novakovic said the new study is \"commendable for providing real-time, clinically relevant information about the state of OFC and improvement in mood.\"</p><p>For their part, the UCSF team believes that an improved understanding of the OFC's role in depression could lead the way to individualized treatment.</p><p> Heather Dawes, who helped to oversee the research, said, \"The more we understand about depression at this level of brain circuitry, the more options we may have for offering patients effective treatments with a low risk of side effects. Perhaps by understanding how these emotion circuits go wrong in the first place, we can even one day help the brain 'unlearn' depression.\" </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Mental Health has more on <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/depression/index.shtml\" target=\"_new\">depression</a>.</p>",

So it requires a balancing act to get enough fiber while limiting calories for weight loss. In other words, it takes careful menu planning to get close to your ideal number of fiber grams.</p><p>One option is to start your day with a high-fiber, whole-grain breakfast like an all-bran cereal -- fast and simple. Most brands have 5 grams in one cup, but read package labels so you know for sure.</p><p>At lunch, add a half-cup of cooked beans or lentils to a green salad for a very filling 7 or 8 grams. One cup of raspberries has about 8 grams, as do many berries, making them great for a snack or dessert (or on top of that high-fiber breakfast cereal).

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 20, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- People with chronic dry eye may find the condition slows them down when they have to read beyond a couple of paragraphs, a new study suggests.</p><p>Researchers found that compared with people without dry eye, those with the condition read at a slower rate when they were tasked with a 7,200-word passage.</p><p>The study authors said that traditional reading tests given during eye exams -- at around 75 words -- may miss the difficulties that dry eye can cause with prolonged reading.</p><p>Chronic dry eye is common, particularly after the age of 50. Nearly 5 million Americans in that age group have the condition, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO).</p><p>The symptoms of dry eye include burning, redness, stinging or a gritty feeling in the eyes; sensitivity to irritants like wind or cigarette smoke; and excessive tearing, as the eyes some/times overproduce tears in response to the dryness, the AAO noted.</p><p>It's common for people with dry eyes to complain of problems with reading, said researcher Dr. Sezen Karakus.</p><p>But those complaints do not always fit with what's seen during eye exams -- which may suggest the person's vision is fine, explained Karakus, an assistant professor of ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins University.</p><p>So the investigators decided to dig deeper, using a longer reading test developed by one of Karakus' colleagues, Dr. Pradeep Ramulu. It takes about 30 minutes to complete and basically simulates reading a book, Karakus explained.</p><p>The researchers recruited a group of adults older than 50. The group included 116 people with \"clinically significant\" dry eye. That meant they showed certain abnormalities on the cornea -- the transparent surface of the eye -- and differences in tear production.</p><p>Another 39 study participants complained of some dry eye symptoms, but had no abnormal eye exam findings. Finally, 31 people without dry eye signs or symptoms served as a control group.</p><p>On average, the study found, the three groups had similar reading rates on a standard, out-loud reading test. But differences cropped up when they took the silent, prolonged reading test. People with clinical dry eye read at a slower rate -- 240 words per minute, versus 272 per minute in the two other groups.</p><p>Dr. Angie Wen is an ophthalmologist at Mount Sinai's New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, in New York City. She said the findings reflect what she often sees in her practice: Patients who see well on visual exams complain of problems with \"sustained visual tasks\" in daily life.</p><p>Wen noted that the average slowdown on the prolonged reading test could hinder people in the \"real world.\"</p><p>\"It can really make a difference in efficiency in the workplace or enjoyment of leisure reading,\" she said, \"especially in those who have other concurrent eye problems, such as decreased contrast acuity from cataracts.\"</p><p>Fortunately, Karakus said, there are treatments for dry eye. People who notice symptoms can try over-the-counter lubricating eye drops, she said -- but it's best to see an eye doctor for an evaluation.</p><p>In certain cases, Karakus said, an underlying medical condition -- like Sjogren's syndrome or rheumatoid arthritis -- might be the cause. Plus, she added, some people may do better with prescription eye drops or other treatments. For example, doctors sometimes insert tiny \"plugs\" into the tear ducts, to help a person's natural tears stay in the eyes longer.</p><p>In the current study, people with clinical dry eye were asked to stop taking any prescription drops for a month. That was to isolate the effects of dry eye, itself, on their reading, Karakus said.</p><p>So it's possible they would have fared better if they'd been using their prescriptions, she noted.</p><p>Lifestyle changes can also ease dry eye, Karakus said. If you wake up with dry eyes, using a humidifier in the bedroom may be wise. And if you spend a lot of time staring at a computer screen, she recommended taking a break every 20 minutes, to blink 20 times.</p><p>It's known, Wen said, that people blink less when they're at a computer, driving or performing other sustained visual tasks. So dry eye may become an increasing concern, she noted, given how much time people spend on computers and phones.</p><p>The study was published online Nov. 15 in the journal <i>Optometry and Vision Science.</i></p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more about chronic dry eye, visit the <a href=\"https://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/what-is-dry-eye\" target=\"_new\">American Academy of Ophthalmology</a>.</p>",

The investigators also found that 44 gene variants implicated in ADHD are linked with depression, anorexia and insomnia.</p><p>\"We now understand better why some individuals develop ADHD, and begin to get insights into the underlying biology, paving the way towards new and better treatment of ADHD,\" Borglum added.</p><p>The genetic areas his team uncovered show that this is primarily a brain disorder, Borglum  said.</p><p>The researchers also found genes that may be linked with ADHD have a role in how brain cells interact and also affect speech development, learning and regulation of dopamine (a chemical messenger that carries signals between brain cells).</p><p>Still, the vast majority of ADHD genetics is still undiscovered and will require larger studies, Borglum said. </p><p> Study author Stephen Faraone noted that the team \"found 12 of the very many -- we don't know how many -- probably thousands of genes related to ADHD.\" Faraone is a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, N.Y.  </p><p>The researchers don't expect to discover just one, two or even 10 genes that each have a dramatic effect on causing ADHD and can be used to diagnose the disorder or quickly develop a treatment, he said. Most likely, a combination of genes and environmental factors trigger ADHD, the study authors said. </p><p>Environmental factors may include being born prematurely and underweight or suffering from developmental problems, such as fetal alcohol syndrome, Faraone said. </p><p>Interestingly, he added, even though medications work in treating ADHD, they don't target the genes that the investigators found were linked to the  condition. None of the genes affected by the drugs showed up in their analysis of genes tied to ADHD, Faraone said.</p><p>The report was published online Nov. 26 in the journal <i>Nature Genetics</i>. </p><p> Ronald Brown, dean of the School of Health Sciences at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas, said, \"This is a promising investigation, as it provides further evidence that ADHD is likely an inherited disorder.\" Brown was not involved with the study, but was familiar with the findings.</p><p>It's been clear for years that ADHD runs in families, he said. These findings are also important because they suggest that certain therapies  effective for one family member are likely to be effective for other family members who are diagnosed with ADHD, he added.</p><p>This study is also important because it shows that several psychological disorders are likely tied to these genes, though no cause-and-effect relationship was proven in the study. This information could help families with prevention and early intervention efforts, Brown said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/index.shtml\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. National Institute of Mental Health</a> for more on ADHD.</p>",

The researchers said the new tissue functioned well.</p><p>\"We have every reason to be optimistic that the success will continue, and if it works, we can change the way we think about treating some of these disc diseases,\" said study co-author Dr. Harvey Smith, an associate professor of orthopedic surgery.</p><p>Spinal discs are the soft tissue between the vertebrae that act as cushions. But the discs can wear out. When this happens, the bones of the spine rub against each other and pinch nerves, making movement painful and difficult. </p><p>About half of Americans suffer from back pain at any given time, the researchers noted. It's a leading cause of disability in the United States, with an estimated cost of $195 billion a year. </p><p>For pain caused by a degenerated disc, two treatments currently exist. In one, surgeons remove the damaged disc and fuse together the spinal bones above and below the surgical location. But this causes the other discs to shift, often leading to damage and pain. </p><p>The other surgery involves replacing the damaged disc with one made of plastic, metal or a combination. These replacements wear out over time.</p><p>In the current experiments, scientists developed a method for taking stem cells from goats and growing new tissue on a matrix that resembles a spinal disc.</p><p>When they implanted the engineered discs back into the goats' necks, the discs became a part of the animal's own tissue, the researchers said.  </p><p>MRIs after eight weeks showed the discs maintained or improved their shape, and their function matched or exceeded that of the goat's own cervical disc.</p><p> Senior researcher Robert Mauck said, \"It will be exciting to see how it performs over longer periods, and especially exciting to start providing some hope for these people who are debilitated by the pain they live with every day.\" </p><p>Previously, Mauck, who is a professor of education and research in orthopedic surgery, and his colleagues implanted discs into rat tails and showed they worked over five weeks. </p><p>In the new study, the researchers chose goats because their cervical spine discs (in the neck bones) are about the same size as human discs. Also, the animals often stand on their hind legs, mimicking the disc compression in people.</p><p>Using this technique in humans is still years off, Mauck said. First, the research team must experiment with more goats and keep the implants in longer to see how they fare over time. Only then will the researchers approach the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to see what is needed to start human trials. </p><p> Dr. Qusai Hammouri, an orthopedic surgeon at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City, said, \"This is an exciting development and could have the potential to help many patients with degenerative disc disease.\" </p><p>But Hammouri, who was not involved with the study, pointed out that just because it works in animals doesn't mean it will work in people. \"Many successes in animal models fail to achieve the desired results in humans,\" he said. </p><p>Moreover, the process of back and neck pain isn't completely understood. Most treatments have mixed results and are less successful as more long-term follow-up data becomes available, Hammouri said.</p><p>\"This study could be the first step on the roadway to helping many or just another dead end,\" he said. \"Science and spine surgery history is filled with exciting developments that eventually lead nowhere. Still, it's a great step in the right direction.\"</p><p>The report was published Nov. 21 in the journal <i>Science Translational Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>For more about spinal surgery, visit the <a href=\"https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/treatment/minimally-invasive-spine-surgery/\" target=\"_new\"> American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons</a>.</p>",

But researchers discovered that places in the United States and Europe where germs called mycobacteria are found in abundance in showerheads are  the same places where bacterial lung infections are most common. In America, that includes parts of Southern California, Florida and New York.</p><p>\"We live in a world covered in bacteria, and the bacteria in our showerheads follow some interesting geographic trends, and can be altered by our water source and water chemistry,\" said study lead author Matthew Gebert.</p><p>\"We're exposed to microbes constantly in our day-to-day lives, some beneficial, some innocuous and a few potentially harmful,\" Gebert  explained.</p><p>He's a research associate at the University of Colorado's Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences.</p><p>Bacteria thrive in showerheads and water distribution systems. Although  most of these bacteria are harmless, some can cause lung infections, he said.</p><p>Still, just because mycobacteria live in your showerhead doesn't mean you'll get sick or are more likely to get a respiratory infection, Gebert added.</p><p>In fact, researchers can't say that a person with a respiratory infection got it through showering, but understanding the sources of mycobacterial exposure is important.</p><p>\"We don't want people rushing home and throwing away their showerheads or obsessively cleaning them every day, nor should anyone change their showering habits -- swallowing the water is OK,\" he said.</p><p>For the study, Gebert and his colleagues analyzed showerheads from homes around the United States and Europe, and found an abundance of bacteria. The kind of germs varied by location, and by the chemistry of the water and where it came from.</p><p>An interesting finding was that homes whose water was treated with chlorine disinfectants had high concentrations of certain germs, the researchers noted.</p><p>The study was published recently in the journal <i>mBio</i>. </p><p>\"I don't think there are necessarily any negative implications from the study,\" Gebert said. \"But because bacteria that can cause illness live in our showerheads, it's important to understand how people can be exposed to them.\"</p><p>Dr. Marc Siegel, a professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, noted that bacteria grow in wet places like showerheads.</p><p>\"This is a reminder to clean your showerhead, which nobody does,\" he said, though \"most of us are likely to tolerate mycobacteria and not get sick from it.\"</p><p>Bacteria in showerheads won't cause an outbreak of lung infections, but people who are run down or who have a compromised immune system or a chronic condition may be vulnerable, Siegel suggested.</p><p>Bacteria also live on your toothbrush and in your sink -- any moist surface, he said. </p><p>Siegel recommends cleaning your showerhead every week or two with a disinfectant that contains ammonia to be sure you kill all the germs nesting there. </p><p>\"Add your showerhead to the list of things in the bathroom that need cleaning,\" he said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/mycobacterialinfections.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Library of Medicine</a> for more on mycobacteria.</p>",

Seventy percent believe science positively affects food quality. But about half believe foods with genetically modified (GM) ingredients are worse for your health than non-GM foods.</p><p>On average, women are more concerned than men about health risks from food additives and from GM foods, the findings showed. And people with limited science knowledge worry more about health risks from these foods than those with greater scientific knowledge.</p><p>The 22 percent of Americans who care a lot about GM foods are likely to think they're worse for health, the survey found. They are also the most concerned about health risks from processed foods and controversial farm practices, such as use of hormones or antibiotics in animals, produce grown with pesticides, or foods containing artificial ingredients.</p><p>These food-safety opinions are personal, not political, added Funk, the lead author of the report.</p><p>\"While there are consistent patterns in public beliefs about these food science issues, the divides do not fall along political lines. Instead, people seem to form their own 'food ideologies' about the relationship between health and the foods we eat,\" she explained in a Pew news release.</p><p>Other key findings: </p><ul><li>Nearly one-third of respondents believe meat from animals given antibiotics or hormones, and produce grown with pesticides, pose a great deal of risk to health. </li><li>While pesticides on foods concern 39 percent of women, they worry just 23 percent of men. Likewise, 39 percent of women, versus one-quarter of men, say meat from animals given antibiotics or hormones is risky.</li><li>More than one-quarter of Americans think artificial preservatives are a long-term health risk. More than one in five says the same about artificial dyes. </li><li>Forty-four percent said they restrict consumption of artificial sweeteners and 38 percent limit sugar. One-third limit artificial preservatives, and close to 30 percent watch out for artificial coloring.</li><li>Of those who care about GM foods, two-thirds believe that meat from animals given antibiotics or hormones is a health risk, compared with 12 percent of those who don't care about the issue.</li><li>People who eat more organic foods are more likely to believe food additives are a risk to health.</li><li>Forty-nine percent of Americans believe foods with GM ingredients are worse for health, while 44 percent are neutral on the issue. Five percent say they're better for health.</li><li>Half of people well-versed in science think GM foods are safe and will increase the world food supply.</li><li>Americans' views about organic foods vary by age. Around half of people aged 18 to 49 say organic produce is better for health. That's true of only 39 percent of adults 65 and older.</li></ul><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on food safety, visit the <a href=\"https://www.foodsafety.gov/\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 8, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- People with type 1 diabetes who use marijuana may double their risk of developing a life-threatening complication, a new study suggests. </p><p>Called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), the condition occurs when there is not enough insulin to break down sugar in the body, so the body burns fat for fuel instead. This triggers a build-up of chemicals known as ketones, which make blood more acidic and can lead to coma or death.</p><p>\"About 30 percent of our patients are using some form of marijuana, and they should be careful when using,\" said study author Dr. Halis Akturk. \"They should be aware of the DKA risk, and recognize the symptoms -- nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and confusion.\"</p><p>Akturk is an assistant professor of medicine and pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes in Aurora, Colo. </p><p>Colorado is one of nine U.S. states that legally allow recreational use of marijuana.</p><p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that develops when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Insulin is a hormone that channels the sugar from foods into the body's cells to be used as fuel. </p><p>People with type 1 diabetes no longer make enough insulin on their own. They must take shots or use an insulin pump to deliver the insulin they need to their bodies. However, getting the dose right is a difficult balancing act. </p><p>Too much insulin can cause dangerous low blood sugar levels that make people shaky, confused and irritable, and if not treated, can cause someone to pass out and possibly to die. </p><p>But too little insulin can lead to high blood sugar levels. Over years, high blood sugar levels can cause the serious complications associated with diabetes, such as heart and kidney disease, vision problems and amputations. Too little insulin can also lead to DKA in as little as a few hours, according to the American Diabetes Association. </p><p>In the new study, the researchers invited adult type 1 diabetes patients at a Colorado hospital to complete a survey on marijuana use. Of 450 survey participants, 134 said they used marijuana. </p><p>The average age of the survey respondents was 39, but among marijuana users it was 31. Cannabis users tended to have lower incomes and education levels. </p><p>Pot users chose to use it in a variety of ways, including smoking, vaping or consuming it in edible products, the investigators found. </p><p>Non-users seemed to have better blood sugar control overall. HbA1C levels -- a blood test that estimates two to three months of blood sugar levels -- were slightly higher in people who used marijuana. </p><p>However, the study only found an association and could not prove a cause-and-effect relationship.</p><p>Dr. Joel Zonszein, director of the clinical diabetes program at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, said, \"I was not surprised that the use of cannabis is associated with DKA. Individuals with type 1 diabetes need to be engaged with their disease and manage insulin dosing constantly, even those on the pump with closed loop systems.\" </p><p>Zonszein said that getting high on marijuana may impair people's ability to give themselves the correct insulin dose. </p><p>\"This study is a warning of the serious and potentially life-threatening 'side effect' of marijuana. This is particularly important due to the ever expanding use of cannabis after its legalization,\" Zonszein  added. </p><p>It's also possible that because marijuana users had lower income and education, an unmeasured factor, such as access to health care or health insurance, may also play a role in raising the risk of DKA, he said. </p><p>The study was published online Nov. 5 as a research letter in <i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about  diabetic ketoacidosis from the <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/complications/ketoacidosis-dka.html\" target=\"_new\">American Diabetes Association</a>.</p>",

For every 5 percent increase in flu activity, they found that hospitalization rates for heart failure rose by approximately 24 percent in the same month.</p> <p>The findings will be presented Saturday during the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions conference in Chicago. </p> <p>\"Influenza can influence cardiovascular events especially in high-risk individuals, so we should not be complacent about vaccination,\" said Dr. Scott Solomon, the study's senior author and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. \"The single best way to improve influenza-related outcomes is to vaccinate people.\"</p> <p>Research earlier this year found that people were six times more likely to have a heart attack in the week after being diagnosed with the flu. But the impact of the virus on heart failure, a condition in which the heart muscle becomes too weak or stiff to pump blood efficiently through the body, hasn't been as clear, Solomon said.</p> <p>\"The goal of this study was really to look at whether we could relate influenza activity occurring regionally and temporarily, or at a particular time of the year, with heart failure hospitalizations that were occurring around the same time,\" he said. </p> <p>Donna Arnett, an epidemiologist and dean of the University of Kentucky College of Public Health, who was not involved in the new research, said the increased risk of heart failure hospitalization found in the study was small but significant enough to send a message.</p> <p>\"The biggest takeaway here is that people who already have heart disease and may be susceptible to heart failure should definitely be vaccinated because influenza is, for the most part, preventable with vaccination,\" she said. </p> <p>The mechanics behind how the flu actually contributes to heart failure is unclear, but Arnett said that's not \"as relevant as what we already know about preventing influenza.\"</p> <p>\"From my perspective as an epidemiologist, we have a vaccine to prevent the disease. We should employ that vaccine as widely as possible, particularly for those who are susceptible to heart failure,\" she said. </p> <p>Flu activity in the U.S. usually begins in October or November, peaks between December and February, and can last as late as May, according to the CDC. Each year in the U.S., the flu is estimated to cause between 12,000 and 56,000 deaths and up to 710,000 hospitalizations.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 14, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Contrary to common belief, blood pressure doesn't have to rise as you age, a study of two remote South American tribes suggests.  </p><p>Looking at the isolated Yanomami tribe in the Venezuelan rainforest, researchers found their blood pressure remained low from youth to age 60.</p><p>That's probably because as hunter-gatherer-gardeners, they don't eat the processed and salted foods common in the so-called Western diet, the researchers said in a new report.</p><p>\"The association between age and blood pressure may not be driven by age itself, but rather the cumulative effects of a Western lifestyle and dietary practices,\" said lead researcher Noel Mueller, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health.</p><p>Another local tribe, the Yekwana, had some access to Western-style foods, and their blood pressure started increasing in childhood, said Mueller.</p><p>\"We believe that rising blood pressure is due to the consumption of processed foods and salt,\" he said. This is what the report refers to as \"unnatural Western exposures.\"</p><p>About 1 in 3 American adults has high blood pressure, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Left untreated, high blood pressure, or hypertension, can lead to heart attack, stroke, sexual dysfunction and other health problems.</p><p>Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a professor of cardiology at Yale University, was enthusiastic about the new findings.</p><p>\"This small study introduces a remarkably powerful idea -- that an increase in blood pressure with age is not inevitable,\" said Krumholz, who wasn't involved with the study.</p><p>It is entirely plausible that a healthy lifestyle could protect against the growing risk of hardening of the arteries with increasing age that is so prevalent in Westernized societies, he said.</p><p>Over five months, Mueller and his team measured the blood pressure of 72 Yanomami and 83 Yekwana members who were between 1 and 60 years old. </p><p>The Yekwana are less isolated than the Yanomami. Because of missions and an airstrip, the Yekwana have some contact with the outside world, including Western-style eating, the researchers noted. </p><p>The study found no age-related increase in blood pressure among the children and adults of the Yanomami. But among the Yekwana, blood pressure began increasing in childhood and went up about 0.25 mm Hg a year on average, Mueller said. </p><p>The Yanomami diet consists of fruits, vegetables and meats from the animals they hunt. Fiber and carbohydrates make up the bulk of their diet, however. \"No salt and no added sugar,\" Mueller said. </p><p>Keeping blood pressure low is key to preventing cardiovascular disease, Mueller said, adding that age-related blood pressure spikes shouldn't be taken for granted.</p><p>\"We can prevent it with interventions that reduce the intake of salt in our diet,\" he said.</p> <p>Life deep in the isolated rainforest isn't all rosy, however. Mueller acknowledged that the Yanomami life span is shorter than that in developed countries because they lack access to antibiotics and other medicines that could prevent or cure infections and diseases. </p><p>Warring with other tribes also shortens their lives, Mueller said.</p><p>The study can't prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship. Still, \"it is worth studying whether the effect of age on our vascular system can be slowed, stopped or even reversed with a healthy lifestyle -- and what particular elements of a healthy lifestyle might make the most difference,\" Krumholz said.</p> <p>As to whether salt is to blame for blood pressure rising with age, Krumholz isn't sure. </p><p>\"There are so many ways that modern society is different from the era in which cardiac disease was rare,\" Krumholz said. </p><p>Differences in dietary, behavioral and environmental exposures make it hard to pinpoint the exact cause of these blood pressure discrepancies, he said. \"It is likely, in the end, to be a result of the combination of factors,\" Krumholz noted.</p><p>The report was published online Nov. 14 in <i>JAMA Cardiology</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>To learn more about healthy blood pressure, visit the <a href=\" https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2016/01/blood-pressure-matters\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institutes of Health</a>.</p>",

People who have type 1 diabetes are unable to produce adequate insulin, a hormone that controls glucose levels. That's because the body's immune system mistakenly attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.</p> <p>A similar process appears to be delayed but happens to the heart muscle of patients with type 1 diabetes whose blood sugar isn't under close control, according to a Harvard-led study published Nov. 26 in the American Heart Association's journal <i>Circulation</i>.</p> <p>People with type 1 diabetes have a higher risk of developing heart disease than the general population, but the reason why hasn't been clearly understood, said Dr. Myra Lipes, the study's senior author and an investigator at Harvard Medical School's Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston.</p> <p>Lipes and other researchers looked at data from a broad clinical trial involving type 1 diabetes patients who were randomly split into two groups.</p> <p>People in one group tightly controlled their blood sugar levels with intensive insulin treatment and frequent glucose monitoring, while those in the other were looser with their regulation and had higher blood sugars. At the start of the experiment, participants were free of heart disease and had regular blood pressure and cholesterol levels. They also did not have eye or kidney problems that are common long-term complications of type 1 diabetes.</p> <p>Researchers found that people exposed to higher blood sugar levels were more likely to develop an autoimmune response to the heart proteins that was linked to later development of heart disease, including calcium buildup in heart arteries, heart attack, bypass surgery and death.</p> <p>\"It wasn't something in the blood itself that triggered this reaction,\" Lipes said. \"It's that the high glucose levels injure the heart muscle tissue, and we postulate that the immune system of people with type 1 diabetes overreacts to this heart injury.\"</p> <p>It's a response that does not occur in type 2 diabetes patients with similarly high glucose levels, she said.</p> <p>But these heart-damaging complications happened many years, even decades, after the autoimmune responses developed, Lipes said. She added that more research is needed to help pinpoint the specific biological reasons responsible for this process.</p> <p>That eventually could help identify which patients are at the highest risk for heart attacks and other heart-related health problems. And ultimately, it could lead to new ways to prevent heart disease, Lipes said.</p> <p>About 5 percent of all people with diabetes have type 1, which is controlled by replacing missing insulin through regular injections or an insulin pump. People with type 2 diabetes also have problems controlling their insulin, but not because of antibodies that destroy insulin-producing cells.</p> <p>Instead, it's often because years of poor diet, lack of regular exercise and excess weight have made their bodies unable to secrete enough insulin to keep up with demand or to use insulin effectively.</p> <p>People with both types of diabetes are known to be at higher risk for heart disease, just for different reasons.</p> <p>The study points out that the difference for patients with type 1 diabetes may stem from the creation of antibodies that attack the heart, said endocrinologist Dr. Robert H. Eckel, a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado.</p> <p>\"They don't occur in everybody, but the control of the diabetes relates to the formation of these antibodies against heart proteins,\" said Eckel, who was not involved in the study. \"In type 2 diabetes, you just don't see these antibodies being developed.\"</p> <p>The study stresses the importance for patients with type 1 diabetes to keep their condition under control, he said.</p> <p>\"First of all, control your diabetes to prevent losing your eyesight, to prevent your kidneys from failing, and also to keep your nerves functioning normally,\" he said. \"But now, we know that better control of your blood sugar seems to prevent this autoimmunity against the heart from occurring.\"</p>",

It removes irritants from the lungs and protects the airway.</li><li>The cough might be due to an upper respiratory tract infection. Even after the infection is gone, you may still have some inflammation in the lungs.</li><li>Coughing can be worse at night. \"For some patients, their cough is so severe that it disrupts their sleep to the point where they aren't getting any sleep at all, which impacts their ability to function during the day. In that situation, you might consider taking a cough suppressant with codeine to blunt the cough reflex and assist with sleep,\" Parsons said in a center news release.</li></ul><p>A cough that lasts more than three weeks may be a chronic condition. If you're still coughing and feeling sick after three weeks, then you should see a doctor. </p><p>Causes of a chronic cough include:</p><ul><li>Uncontrolled allergies, </li><li>Uncontrolled asthma, </li><li>Side effects of medicine, </li><li>Acid reflux.</li></ul><p>Persistent cough might be a symptom of a serious illness.</p><p>\"If you're coughing up blood, spiking fevers or have significant shortness of breath associated with the cough, you need to be evaluated quickly. You could have walking pneumonia. If you're a smoker, it could be cancer.

It even estimates their annual risk of stroke.</p><p>The pop-up then requires doctors to either prescribe a blood thinner or give a reason why such a medicine shouldn't be used. Possible reasons include \"bleeding risk is too high,\" \"patient is at high risk for falls,\" or \"patient refuses anticoagulation.\"</p><p>To see whether the alert would make a difference, the researchers randomly assigned 458 a-fib patients so about half would have their records reviewed by the program.</p><p>About 19 percent of patients in the alert group had a prescription for blood thinners during hospitalization, at discharge and three months later, researchers found. By comparison, only 7 percent of the control group had been prescribed blood thinners.</p><p>By three months after hospitalization, the alert group had a dramatic effect on patients' odds for heart attack or stroke, although that didn't translate to a lessening of the death rate, the team noted.</p><p>Still, the study showed that reminder systems like this actually really work to cut the odds for cardiac events, said Walsh, who is president of the American College of Cardiology.</p><p>\"We as physicians can't keep everything in our brains all the time,\" she said. \"It's clear in medicine if we have reminders, we more commonly prescribe drugs and take action.\"</p><p>But even though doctors are moving toward the use of electronic health records, it's not clear how easily hospital data centers could incorporate such an alert into their usual systems, Walsh said.</p><p>\"All electronic health records could do it probably, but not all are set up to do it,\" Walsh said. \"I can tell you, my electronic health record doesn't do this kind of thing. It's not an automatic thing that happens.\"</p><p>Adding such an alert system might be costly for some hospitals, Piazza added.</p><p>\"Implementation of alert-based [computerized decision support] requires an investment in programming and medical informatics infrastructure which may not be available at some medical centers,\" Piazza said.</p><p>Experts note that findings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on atrial fibrillation, visit the <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/atrial-fibrillation/what-is-atrial-fibrillation-afib-or-af\" target=\"_new\">American Heart Association</a>.</p>",

They were asked how often they sat down for dinner with their families, how well their family functions, and about their eating habits.</p><p>Teens and young adults who ate with their family more tended to eat more fruits and vegetables and less fast or takeout food. This happened regardless of how families managed daily routines, communicated and connected emotionally, according to the researchers.</p><p>Published Nov. 21 in the journal <i>JAMA Network Open</i>, the study couldn't prove that family dinner caused teens to become healthy eaters, only that there was an association.</p><p>Still, \"to reap the many benefits of family dinners, the meal doesn't have to be a big drawn-out affair,\" said study co-author Jess Haines, a professor of family relations and applied nutrition at Guelph.</p><p>\"Even if it's something you pull out of the freezer, add a bagged salad on the side and you'll have a decent nutritional meal,\" Haines said.</p><p>Walton also noted that when teens and young adults help prepare food, they are more likely to eat it and learn important food skills.</p><p>\"Our research found that family dinners are a great way to improve the dietary intake of the whole family, regardless of how well the family functions together,\" Walton said. \"Preparing and enjoying a meal together can also help families bond.

Along with the cancer risk in animals, it's not known what effect the six additives might have when used combination with other ingredients, according to the council's Erik Olson.</p><p>He also noted that the six ingredients are listed on food labels only as \"artificial flavor,\" which means there's no way for consumers to know in what concentrations they're used in specific products.</p><p>\"It's all secret.

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Dec. 4, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- A new gene therapy shows early promise against sickle cell anemia, researchers say.</p><p>The therapy targets the genetic flaw that causes sickle cell. In a small group of patients, researchers said the therapy appears safe and effective enough to keep moving forward into larger trials.</p><p>\"We've been talking about using gene therapy for sickle cell anemia for years. Now it's finally coming of age,\" said Dr. John Tisdale, a scientist with the U.S. National Institutes of Health who is leading the ongoing research.</p><p>Sickle cell anemia is an inherited disease that mainly affects people of African, South American or Mediterranean descent. In the United States, about 1 in 365 black children is born with the condition, according to the NIH.</p><p>It arises when a person inherits two copies of an abnormal hemoglobin gene -- one from each parent. Hemoglobin is an oxygen-carrying protein within red blood cells.</p><p>When those cells contain \"sickle\" hemoglobin, they become crescent-shaped, rather than disk-shaped. They tend to be sticky and can clot -- causing symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath.</p><p>Many people with sickle cell also suffer bouts of severe pain due to poor blood circulation. Over time, the disease can damage organs throughout the body, leading to complications like kidney disease and stroke.</p><p>\"It's a devastating disease,\" Tisdale said. \"People often die early, in their 40s.\"</p><p>He presented the preliminary results this week at the American Society of Hematology's annual meeting, in San Diego.</p><p>There are treatments, such as the cancer drug hydroxyurea, which can help prevent severe pain and certain other complications. But the medications don't change the course of the disease.</p><p>There is one way to \"fix\" it, Tisdale said: a bone marrow transplant.</p><p>The procedure destroys a person's existing bone marrow stem cells -- which are producing the faulty red blood cells -- and replaces them with stem cells from a healthy donor.</p><p>The problem, Tisdale said, is that the donor has to be a genetic match (usually a sibling) who is free of sickle cell.</p><p>\"That covers about 10 percent of patients,\" he said. \"We need something for the other 90 percent.\"</p><p>That's where gene therapy could come in. Tisdale explained the basics: First, doctors remove a supply of blood-forming stem cells from the patient, before using chemotherapy to wipe out the remaining stem cells.</p><p>Next, they use a modified virus to deliver a \"therapeutic\" gene into the extracted stem cells. The gene is an \"anti-sickling\" version of the beta globulin gene, which is mutated in sickle cell.</p><p>Those genetically modified stem cells are then infused back into the patient -- with the aim of repopulating the body with normal red blood cells.</p><p>Tisdale's team initially treated seven patients with severe sickle cell who'd suffered complications from the disease. The gene therapy did produce new red blood cells, but at fairly low levels. So the researchers tweaked the procedure, and tested it in six other patients.</p><p>Of those patients, four had been followed for about three months on average as of May 2018. By that point, all had at least as many normal red blood cells as sickle-affected cells.</p><p>\"We're also seeing a resolution of anemia and pain,\" Tisdale said.</p><p>The short-term side effects included fever caused by a drop in white blood cells, inflammation in the mouth, and chest pain.</p><p>This is not the first report of gene therapy being used for sickle cell. Last year, French researchers described the case of a teenage boy who was doing well 15 months after receiving gene therapy. Tisdale said that approach was very similar to the one his team used.</p><p>So far, research has focused on people with severe sickle cell.</p><p>But ultimately, the hope is to use gene therapy earlier in the course of the disease to prevent complications, said Dr. Caterina Minniti, director of the Montefiore Medical Center's Sickle Cell Center for Adults in New York City.</p><p>Minniti, who was not involved in the research, called the early results \"very exciting.\"</p><p>Still, she cautioned that it will be a while before the approach is available for widespread use. With any gene therapy, Minniti noted, there are always questions about the long-term \"stability\" of the inserted gene, and whether it could have any unintended effects in the body.</p><p>But overall, she said, the outlook for sickle cell patients is improving. A new drug for preventing complications, called Endari (L-glutamine), received U.S. approval last year, and others are on the way.</p><p>\"The development of therapies has dramatically accelerated in recent years,\" Minniti said.</p><p>Research presented at meetings is usually considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has more on <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/sickle-cell-disease\" target=\"_new\">sickle cell anemia</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Dec. 4, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- As many as 4 out of 5 Americans withhold important information from their doctor that could prove crucial to their health, a new study shows.</p><p>Between 60 and 80 percent of people admit they avoid telling their doctor details that could be relevant to their well-being.</p><p>\"I know at some level this is a 'no duh,' of course, people mislead, but I was surprised how pervasive it is,\" said senior researcher Angela Fagerlin, chair of population health sciences at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. \"A lot of people are not fully honest with their provider. They don't tell them all the information they could tell them.\"</p><p>Shame and fear appear to be at the root of this lack of communication, the researchers found.</p><p>Patients don't want to admit that they disagree with their doctor or don't understand what the doctor has told them, Fagerlin said. People also don't want to fess up about their unhealthy behaviors.</p><p>But keeping this information secret can lead to some very dire consequences.</p><p>American Academy of Family Physicians President Dr. John Cullen recalled a situation years ago when a patient with apparent appendicitis was being prepped for surgery.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, methamphetamine can sometimes present the same way as appendicitis,\" said Cullen, a family physician in Valdez, Alaska, with more than 25 years of experience. \"As we're getting ready to take him to the operating room, I remember saying, 'We're about to cut you open here. Are you sure you don't want to tell me anything else?' </p><p>\"That's when we found out about the methamphetamine use,\" Cullen continued. \"Indeed, that was the cause, and we stopped the surgery.\"</p><p>Sharing information can also help doctors prevent drug interactions, or change a patient's treatment plan so he or she will be more likely to comply with it, Fagerlin said.</p><p>For the study, Fagerlin and her colleagues surveyed two different pools of patients, 4,510 in all.</p><p>One group had an average age of 36, while the other had an average age of 61. The younger group of patients consistently tended to withhold information more often than the older folks, 81 percent and 61 percent, respectively.</p><p>The most common thing people don't tell their doctor is that they don't agree with the physician's recommended course of treatment, the researchers found. About 46 percent of people in the younger group and 31 percent in the older group said they'd done this.</p><p>This is not good because people who disagree with their doctor might not follow through on taking prescribed medications or receiving recommended follow-up tests, Fagerlin said.</p><p>Second most often, people wouldn't admit that they didn't fully understand the instructions a provider gave them. That happened with 32 percent of younger patients and 24 percent of older patients.</p><p>After that, patients most often withheld information about personal habits that could be unhealthy -- poor diet (24 percent for younger and 20 percent for older patients), not taking medication as prescribed (22 and 18 percent), not exercising (22 percent in both groups), or taking someone else's prescription medication (14 and 9 percent).</p><p>The researchers also asked why patients didn't tell the whole story, and the No. 1 reason was that they didn't want the doctor to give them a hard time about their behavior (82 and 64 percent)</p><p>\"They didn't want to get a lecture from their doctor,\" Fagerlin said. \"They didn't want to get scolded.\"</p><p>Other reasons included:</p><ul><li>I didn't want to hear how bad a behavior is for me (76 and 61 percent).</li><li>I was embarrassed to admit something (61 and 50 percent).</li><li>I didn't want the provider to think I'm a difficult patient (51 and 38 percent).</li><li>I didn't want to take up any more of the provider's time (45 and 36 percent).</li><li>I didn't think it mattered (39 and 33 percent).</li><li>I didn't want the provider to think I'm stupid (38 and 31 percent).</li><li>I didn't want this information in my medical record (34 and 31 percent).</li></ul><p>That last reason is particularly important in the new age of electronic health records (EHRs) that are easily swapped between doctors, said Cullen, who wasn't involved in the study.</p><p>\"I think EHRs worry people,\" Cullen said. \"A lot of times I'll make a point of saying, 'This will not go on the record' and close up my computer, so they know what they're telling me is privileged information. In a small town, that's really important.\"</p><p>Doctors can help their patients air disagreements or misunderstandings regarding their treatment by asking for feedback, Fagerlin said.</p><p>\"Providers can do things like say, 'I just gave you a whole bunch of information and I know it's really confusing, and I'm not sure I did it in the best way. Can you let me know what you heard from me to make sure I got it right?' \" Fagerlin said. \"Or they can ask, 'Do you agree with this or do you think another route of care might be better?' \"</p><p>Such back-and-forth is \"really the essence of the patient-physician relationship,\" Cullen said.</p><p>\"This is the art of medicine right here, and this is why it's so important to have a physician you can relate to and who is engaged in that two-way communication,\" Cullen said.</p><p>The new study was published Nov. 30 in the journal <i>JAMA Network Open</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians has more about <a href=\"https://www.aafp.org/dam/AAFP/documents/medical_education_residency/fmig/tips_relationships.pdf\" target=\"_new\">doctor/patient relations</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 14, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Born weighing almost 10 pounds, Caden Konecny arrived pink and loud. His mom, Ashlea, loved everything about her first-born child, except his struggles to breastfeed.</p> <p> Perhaps she was doing something wrong?</p> <p> At Caden's six-week checkup, he was down to 7.5 pounds. A few weeks later, a bad cough landed him in the hospital.</p> <p>\"He sounded like an old man trying to breathe,\" Ashlea said. </p> <p> Doctors suspected that Caden had bronchitis. Soon, a doctor noticed something wrong with his heart. A pediatric cardiologist became involved, prompting more tests.</p> <p> Hours later, Ashlea and her husband Paul learned that Caden needed open-heart surgery.</p> <p> Caden was born with one artery exiting his heart instead of two. Of all heart defects babies can be born with, this happens in less than 1 percent of them. </p> <p> The condition is called truncus arteriosus. The pulmonary artery and aorta begin as one vessel, then divide into two as the heart develops. Caden's never divided, so he was missing the pulmonary artery that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. </p> <p> During the operation, doctors would create a new pulmonary artery. They also would patch another problem, a hole between the heart chambers that allowed oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood to mix. </p> <p> Adding to the drama, such a procedure couldn't be done at their local hospital in Derby, Kansas. Caden had to be transported to Kansas City, three hours away.</p> <p> The surgery went well, or so it seemed. </p> <p> After his breathing tubes were removed, the patch to the hole became dislodged. A second surgery was needed to repair that. Six weeks later, they returned home to recover, but that was short-lived. Something still didn't seem right, and after a weekend with baby Caden screaming nonstop, they drove the three hours back to Kansas City. </p> <p> Doctors said Caden was in heart failure again. He had his second open-heart surgery, repairing the new pulmonary artery. His chest was too swollen to close after surgery, so doctors covered it with bandages overnight. </p> <p> During the night, his heart stopped beating, and doctors manually massaged his heart for 45 minutes before it restarted. He spent the next eight days connected to a machine that breathed and pumped blood for him. </p> <p>\"They talked about possibly having to turn off the machine if things did not improve,\" Ashlea said. \"They talked about how he could have brain damage because he had CPR for so long.\" </p> <p> Three and a half months after Caden was hospitalized for his first heart surgery, he went home. Unlike that initial trip home with a fat, seemingly healthy baby, the Konecnys faced all sorts of challenges.</p> <p> Caden had a feeding tube and required twice-daily injections of blood thinners, as well as other medications. He couldn't hold up his head or roll over like other kids his age, and he couldn't swallow because his vocal cords were temporarily paralyzed. A variety of specialists visited the house to help him overcome those challenges.</p> <p> Fortunately, their hard work -- and Caden's -- helped him recover. He started eating solid food and eventually only took water pills and blood pressure pills. When he started school, he got extra help, as children who have been on a heart and breathing machine often have learning and processing difficulties. </p> <p> In 2015, Caden turned 9. He'd outgrown the pulmonary artery doctors had put in, so he needed a new one. That required his third open-heart surgery.</p> <p> Ashlea was scared, of course, remembering all that went wrong last time and the challenges of recovery.</p> <p> The worry was for naught. </p> <p> Surgery was uneventful and now Caden, who turns 12 this month, is off all medications. He visits the cardiologist only once a year for a checkup.</p> <p> As he grows into his adult height, he'll eventually need yet another pulmonary artery. </p> <p>\"I don't think about it much,\" Caden said, \"though I'm a little worried about it.\"</p> <p> Caden continues to stay busy with school, playing the violin, reading and playing board and computer games. He even learned to crochet like his mom, and is making a blanket. While his younger brother Cameron is usually found outside playing sports, Caden isn't interested -- a good thing considering he's not allowed to play high-contact sports.</p> <p>\"I like making movies and writing historical military fiction,\" Caden said.</p> <p> Caden and his family have participated in the Wichita Heart Walk since he was 2, several times as the child spokesperson. He was also part of an American Heart Association survivor campaign with his maternal grandmother, who also had open-heart surgery when she was a child. </p> <p> Ashlea often talks to other \"heart moms\" when they need support for a child's congenital heart defect. About 40,000 U.S. babies are born each year with a heart defect, about eight in every 1,000 babies. </p> <p> Through her crochet community, Ashlea has shared Caden's story and a heart surgery doll she made to include tubes, bandages and an incision. She modified the original doll design for those who want to help friends or families going through heart surgery, or to donate to a children's hospital. </p> <p>Caden's heart problems have taught her to be more accepting and less judgmental of others. And \"I value the friends we've made because of this,\" Ashlea said.</p>",

The children's mental health was tracked from birth until they averaged about 10 years of age.</p><p>Christensen's group concluded that \"maternal use of valproate  during pregnancy was associated with a small but significantly increased risk of ADHD in the offspring, even after adjusting for maternal psychiatric disease, maternal epilepsy,\" and other factors.</p><p>Other epilepsy drugs appeared to have no effect on ADHD rates, the researchers noted. The findings were published online Jan. 4 in <i>JAMA Network Open</i>.</p><p>Two U.S. experts said that most women with epilepsy are already counseled to avoid valproate during  pregnancy.</p><p>\"This study provides yet more data highlighting risks of using valproate in women of childbearing age,\" said Dr. Fred Lado, who directs epilepsy care for Queens and Long Island as part of the New York City Northwell Health system.</p><p>According to Lado, it's been long known that \"valproate produces birth defects in up to 10 percent of children exposed in utero.\" The drug also \"reduces average IQ [in exposed offspring] and increases the likelihood of behavioral problems,\" he said.</p><p>The new study \"adds to the already compelling list of reasons for avoiding valproate use in women of childbearing age,\" Lado said.  In most cases, women can switch to another anti-seizure medicine, but \"in the rare cases where there is no alternative to valproate, women should be informed fully about the risks and counseled on the use of contraceptives,\" he added.</p><p>Dr. Andrew Adesman is chief of child developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Children's Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park.  He said the new study \"once again raises the concern that prenatal exposure to valproate puts a fetus at increased risk of ADHD as a child.\"</p><p> Adesman stressed that while avoidance of valproate is the preferred option during a pregnancy, women who have taken the drug while pregnant should not panic.</p><p>\"It must be kept in mind that, despite the increased risk of ADHD, only about 10 percent  of children exposed to valproate prenatally ended up having ADHD,\" Adesman said. \"So, women who were treated with valproate during their pregnancy should be reassured by the fact that the chances are pretty small that their child will have ADHD as a function of valproate exposure during pregnancy.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/index.shtml\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. National Institute of Mental Health</a> for more on ADHD.</p>",

He is director of the Down syndrome program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.</p><p>\"Contrary to some public beliefs, people with Down syndrome never stop learning, and functional skills can still be attained and improved well into adulthood,\" he said in a hospital news release.</p><p>For the study, Skotko and colleagues combined the results of surveys of more than 2,600 families in the United States and the Netherlands.</p><p>The U.S. survey, conducted in 2009, asked parents to rank their child's functional abilities in 11 areas: walking; eating; speaking; grooming and personal hygiene; reading; writing; preparing meals; working at a job; going on dates; traveling alone; and living independently.</p><p>Parents were also asked if their child had significant health problems or learning difficulties.</p><p>The same questionnaire was completed by Dutch families in 2016.</p><p>For both groups, the ages of the family members with Down syndrome ranged from under 5 to over 40, with the largest number in the younger age groups.</p><p>The results showed that most people with Down syndrome in the United States could walk by 25 months, speak reasonably well by age 12 years, maintain personal hygiene by 13 and work independently by 20.</p><p>By age 31, nearly half were reading reasonably well, 46 percent could write reasonably well, 34 percent were living independently, and about 30 percent could travel independently, the findings showed. </p><p>Dutch parents reported largely similar results.</p><p>Learning problems were reported more often than health problems, and serious health problems increased with age, the researchers found.</p><p>\"Now we have guideposts -- based on the responses of thousands of parents -- that can help clinicians know when children may be falling behind their peers with Down syndrome and, when necessary, refer parents to additional supports, resources and therapies,\" Skotko said.</p><p>In America, \"wrongful birth\" and  \"wrongful life\" lawsuits have been filed by parents of children with Down syndrome or on behalf of the children. These suits claim that they were not given information allowing them to terminate a pregnancy or that the child is living a life of suffering, Skotko said.</p><p>\"These headline-grabbing lawsuits center around basic questions, such as what a person with Down syndrome can reasonably be expected to achieve. Such discussions should be centered around accurate information, rather than wild, outdated speculation, and we hope our research will help give clearer answers to those questions,\" he explained.</p><p>The report was published online Jan. 2 in the <i>American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on Down syndrome, visit the <a href=\"https://www.ndss.org/about-down-syndrome/down-syndrome-facts\" target=\"_new\"> National Down Syndrome Society</a>.</p>",

Moreover, the risk rises as weight increases, even affecting men in the high normal weight range. </p><p>\"It's been known for some time that obesity can increase an individual's risk of developing pancreatic cancer, and [this is] an important new finding suggesting that obesity and overweight in adolescence can also impact risk,\" said Allison Rosenzweig, a senior manager at the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.</p><p>But being overweight or obese doesn't doom you to getting the disease, said Rosenzweig, who had no role in the study.  </p><p>\"Because pancreatic cancer is a relatively rare disease, thought to impact around 55,000 Americans this year, even those at an increased risk have a low likelihood of developing the disease,\" she said.</p><p>Also, because this study looked at retrospective data, it can't prove that excess weight is a cause of pancreatic cancer, only that an association exists.</p><p>Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, with a five-year survival rate below 10 percent, according to the cancer network. </p><p>For the new study, researchers led by Dr. Zohar Levi, of Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva and Tel Aviv University, collected data on more than 1 million Jewish men and 700,000 Jewish women in Israel. Participants had physical examinations at ages 16 to 19 from 1967 to 2002. </p><p>Using the Israeli National Cancer Registry, the researchers identified cases of pancreatic cancer through 2012. Their follow-up revealed 551 new cases of pancreatic cancer. </p><p>Compared with normal weight, obesity was associated with a nearly four times higher risk for cancer among men. Among women, the risk was slightly more than four times higher, the researchers found.</p><p>Overall, the researchers attributed almost 11 percent of the pancreatic cases to teenage overweight and obesity. </p><p>The report was published online Nov. 12 in the journal <i>Cancer</i>. </p><p>Dr. Chanan Meydan, of the Mayanei Hayeshua Medical Center in Israel, wrote an editorial accompanying the study. He said weight gain in adolescence may increase inflammation, which damages cells and might raise cancer risk.</p><p>\"It would be interesting to find whether the inflammatory process in obesity has links to the inflammatory process in malignancy. Are they connected somehow?\" said Meydan. </p><p>The mechanism behind inflammation is \"for the most part, a delicately balanced phenomenon with grave consequences when it's out of balance,\" he said.</p><p>Learning more about how this \"switchboard of control\" works may help scientists better understand the association between obesity and cancer, Meydan added. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Cancer Institute has more about <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/types/pancreatic/patient/pancreatic-treatment-pdq\" target=\"_new\">pancreatic cancer</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Jan. 8, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- A \"low-energy-dense food diet\" sounds like just another weight loss fad, but it's an approach with decades of research behind it.</p><p>The concept is simple: Eat more foods with a higher water content to get more volume for fewer calories.</p><p>Energy density is simply the amount of energy -- or calories -- in a gram of a food. Foods can be very low-, low-, medium- or high-energy density.</p><p>Butter, for instance, is a high-density food with 180 calories in 20 grams. Watermelon is very low, with just 7 calories in 20 grams. Portion size is another way to see the difference. For example, one and a half juicy oranges have the same number of calories as a mere three pretzel rods.</p><p>To find a food's energy density, divide the number of calories in a serving by the number of grams in that serving. Energy density ranges in the very low category are from 0.5 to 1 calorie/gram. As you move to the high end, it's from 4 to 9 calories per gram.</p><p>You can easily calculate the energy density of any food. Use a calorie counter to do the math for fresh foods. For packaged ones, use the Nutrition Facts Panel and divide the calories by the grams in a portion.</p><p>Low-energy density foods are usually high in fiber as well as water, so they're filling. That's one reason why replacing high-energy density foods with low ones to reduce calories is more effective than just cutting portion sizes, which can leave you feeling deprived. Eating low-energy density foods works equally well for weight loss and weight maintenance.</p><p>In recipes, making the switchover can be as simple as adding more non-starchy vegetables in place of starchy ones, and some of the meat. Rather than eating sandwiches, replace the bread with leafy greens by putting the sandwich fillings into a big salad. When eating grains, choose foods like oatmeal and quinoa that increase in volume when cooked in water -- they're a lot more filling than dry cereal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has much more on <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/nutrition/pdf/r2p_energy_density.pdf\" target=\"_new\">the energy density of foods</a> and tips to make substitutions.</p>",

During surgery, antibiotics to prevent infection should not be used indiscriminately.</li><li>Ampicillin is the first choice of treatment for children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia who are otherwise healthy and immunized. Broader-spectrum antibiotics, such as cephalosporins, have been shown to contribute to antibiotic resistance and are often unnecessary, the authors noted.</li><li>Antibiotics such as vancomycin or carbapenems should be avoided unless a child is known to have a specific risk for germs that are resistant to other antibiotics.</li><li>Prolonged use of IV antibiotics should be avoided. For most infections, children respond well to antibiotics given by mouth after brief treatment with IV antibiotics.</li> </ul><p>\"We want to see children get healthy as soon as possible while avoiding the potential harms of antibiotic overuse,\" said Dr. Jeff Gerber, a member of the infectious diseases committee. \"Ultimately, the decision is left to the discretion of the medical team.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics has more on <a href=\"https://healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/at-home/medication-safety/Pages/Antibiotic-Prescriptions-for-Children.aspx\" target=\"_new\">antibiotics</a>.</p>",

Make sure they know how to read food labels and to save the labels of packaged foods.</p><p>\"The other thing to ask them to keep in mind is cross contamination. If the host is baking cookies, for instance, they should wash the cookie sheet that was used to make peanut butter cookies with hot soapy water before it's used to bake something that is nut-free,\" Wada said. </p><p>\"Also, suggest using color-coded utensils so guests know which utensils go with each particular dish,\" she said.</p><p>Offer to bring dishes or snacks that are safe for you. Another option is to eat before the party and bring a snack with you.</p><p>Be cautious about foods that appear familiar, including fresh fruit and vegetables, pasta or meats. Check the labels to be on the safe side.</p><p>\"Some pre-seasoned turkeys may have wheat, soy or milk in the brine or other flavorings. Some people may not realize pesto has nuts in it.

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Jan. 7, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Alzheimer's disease may be twice as common in black Americans as in whites, and scientists don't really know why.</p><p>But new research uncovers a clue that suggests that diagnosing the brain-robbing disease may not be the same for these two populations.</p><p>The study found that black people typically have lower levels of the brain protein tau. And because rising levels of tau are considered a sign of Alzheimer's, blacks may not meet the same threshold as whites for when Alzheimer's starts.</p><p>\"If we only study Alzheimer's in Caucasians, we'll only learn about Alzheimer's in Caucasians,\" said researcher Dr. John Morris. He is a professor of neurology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.</p><p>\"If we want to understand all the ways the disease can develop in people, we need to include people from all groups. Without a complete understanding of the illness, we're not going to be able to develop therapies that work for all people,\" Morris said. </p><p>For the study, Morris and his colleagues analyzed data from more than 1,200 people, of whom 14 percent (173) were black. The participants averaged 71 years of age. </p><p>Two-thirds of the participants had no signs of memory loss or confusion, and the remaining one-third had very mild or mild Alzheimer's, according to the report.</p><p>All of the study participants underwent a PET scan to detect amyloid plaques in the brain, an MRI scan for signs of brain shrinkage and damage, or a spinal tap to measure levels of proteins in spinal fluid linked to Alzheimer's.</p><p>MRI and PET scans found no significant differences between black patients and white patients, but spinal fluid revealed lower levels of tau among black people, the researchers said.</p><p>Elevated tau has been linked to brain damage, memory loss and confusion, but having lower levels of tau didn't protect black patients from those problems, the investigators found.</p><p>\"With tau, the pattern was the same in African-Americans and whites -- the higher your tau level, the more likely you were cognitively impaired -- but the absolute amounts were consistently lower in African-Americans,\" Morris said.</p><p>This means that assuming tau levels to be the same among different populations may result in an inaccurate diagnosis, he explained.</p><p>The difference in tau was greatest among those with the gene mutation APOE4, which confers a higher risk for Alzheimer's. Earlier studies found that this mutation had a weaker effect in black people.</p><p>The new study findings showed that people who had the lower-risk form of the APOE4 gene had similar levels of tau.</p><p>\"It looks like the APOE4 risk factor doesn't operate the same in African-Americans as it does in whites,\" Morris said in a university news release. </p><p>A more complete understanding of the ways Alzheimer's develops could open up new avenues of research to prevent or treat the disease, the researchers said.</p><p>The report was published Jan. 7 in the journal <i>JAMA Neurology</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on Alzheimer's disease, visit the <a href=\"https://www.alz.org/\" target=\"_new\"> Alzheimer's Association</a>.</p>",

But try steel-cut oats, which are less refined than rolled oats. Or shake up your morning routine by cooking up grits or buckwheat for your hot cereal.</p><p>Cooked barley, besides being a tasty side dish, can make a hearty addition to your favorite vegetable soup for a satisfying lunch or dinner. Be sure to make enough barley to sprinkle what's left over onto your next salad.</p><p>Build dinner around a serving of polenta or quinoa-pasta topped with sauteed vegetables.</p><p>Vary your favorite recipes simply by making whole grain substitutions. Instead of making a risotto or a pilaf side dish with white rice, try using buckwheat, millet, couscous or polenta as the grain. Whichever one you use will take on the flavors of the other ingredients in the recipe.</p><p>Note that many grains cook in little time, but you might find it handy to make a large batch once or twice a week.

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 19, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- For  people with diabetes, blood sugar isn't the only important measurement. New  cholesterol guidelines suggest the more than 110 million U.S. adults with  diabetes or prediabetes also should manage their cholesterol. </p><p>The guidelines released earlier this month during the American Heart  Association's Scientific Sessions conference suggest doctors consider  prescribing cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins to people with diabetes who  are age 40 to 75. The guidelines also give a raft of other specific recommendations  for people with diabetes based on age and other risk factors.</p><p>The reality has been scientifically clear for a while, but  many people are not aware of the connection: Middle-age adults with diabetes are usually considered at moderate to high  risk for cardiovascular disease.</p><p>\"It's not new but it's important. If you have diabetes, you  have to work to get your cholesterol under control,\" said Dr. Scott Grundy,  chair of the guidelines writing committee and professor of internal medicine at  the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Veterans Affairs Medical  Center in Dallas. </p><p>Shaun Rivers and Kim Ketter preach much the same thing to  their clients. </p><p>Their company in Petersburg, Virginia, provides diabetes  counseling and educational training. The women, who are twins, believe managing  chronic conditions such as diabetes need a \"holistic approach.\"  </p><p>For them, that means keeping tabs on the bigger picture,  like exercise, blood pressure and cholesterol. </p><p>\"We liken it to a three-legged stool,\" said Ketter, a nurse  practitioner. \"All things are connected, and you have to learn to manage them  all. If you fix one, you might help fix the other ones, and if you fail to  manage one, the stool might fall over.\" </p><p>More than 30 million people in the United States have  diabetes, although one in four doesn't know it, according to Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention statistics. Another 80 million have prediabetes,  a serious health condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but  not high enough yet to be diagnosed as Type 2 diabetes. </p><p>Over the past 20 years, the number of adults diagnosed with  diabetes has more than tripled as the population has aged and become more  overweight or obese.</p><p>There are well-established risk factors for heart disease,  such as smoking, high blood pressure and high blood sugar. There also are what  the new cholesterol guidelines call \"risk-enhancing factors\" such as family  history, chronic kidney disease and metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a  cluster of at least three diagnosed conditions, including high blood pressure,  high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist and abnormal cholesterol  levels.</p><p>Rivers and Ketter use everyday items such as garden hoses to  explain what the waxy-like, fatty buildup of cholesterol can do to the body. </p><p>\"Folks don't understand how it can affect the body overall,\"  Ketter said. \"It's like a garden hose, and you have gunk and stuff inside of it  accumulated over the years. You are going to have to turn up the pressure to  get the same water through that hose. If all that mess is clogging the  arteries, you have to turn up the pressure, and that means your heart is  pumping harder.\" </p><p>While the new cholesterol guidelines suggest doctors talk to  patients with diabetes about risk, lifestyle, and the possible need for  statins, Ketter said she also wants to make sure her patients \"on the cusp\" of  needing medicine are willing to work on good nutrition, exercise and any \"bad  habits.\"</p><p>\"It's going to be a lifestyle change for a lot of them,\"  said Rivers, an advanced diabetes clinical nurse specialist. </p><p>She and her sister should know about that. Although  \"perfectly healthy otherwise,\" the two were diagnosed about a decade ago with  congestive heart failure, possibly from a genetic cause. </p><p>\"In our own personal lives, we deal with (cholesterol),\"  Ketter said. \"Our patients respect us for being honest. Life is a series of  hills and valleys. Sometimes you are in the valley and can't get it right and  sometimes you are on the hill and looking out. Either way, you make corrections  and move on.\"</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 6, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Medical science has made tremendous advances in \"personalized medicine\" -- drugs that fight cancer and other diseases by boosting the immune system or targeting specific genetic traits.</p><p>Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter benefited from one of these drugs, Keytruda (pembrolizumab), which successfully beat back his brain cancer by ramping up his immune system.</p><p>But the American public is still struggling to understand the implications of these new targeted treatments, a new <i>HealthDay/Harris Poll</i> has found.</p><p>A large majority (71 percent) of Americans are unfamiliar with personalized medicine, the survey found.</p><p>Among those who are familiar with the concept, nearly half (49 percent) don't understand that this new type of therapy is typically more successful, with fewer side effects, compared to other treatments.</p> <p>On the other hand, most (62 percent) didn't realize that the cost of the drugs will be significantly higher than other treatments.</p><p>The online survey of over 2,000 adults was conducted Nov. 15-19.</p><p>\"Very few Americans know a lot about personalized medicine but, nevertheless, people are excited about it, particularly regarding its potential to save lives and revolutionize health care,\" said Deana Percassi, managing director of The Harris Poll's public relations research practice.</p><p>Personalized medicine, also called precision medicine, uses genetic profiling and specific knowledge of a person's body to optimize therapies.</p><p>For example, there's a drug called Lynparza (olaparib) that treats people with advanced breast and ovarian cancers caused by mutations of the BRCA gene. The drug blocks an enzyme and makes it more likely for cancerous cells to die off more quickly.</p><p>In an advance for the field, last week the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a drug for a treatment of a wide range of cancers based on a shared mutation. The drug, Vitrakvi (larotrectinib), can treat thyroid, lung, and head and neck cancers caused by a common genetic factor.</p><p><b>Doctors need to spread the word</b></p><p>Despite advances like this, two in five people (41 percent) are not at all familiar with personalized medicine, and only 5 percent said they are very familiar, the survey found.</p><p>That doesn't surprise Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, acting chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society.</p><p>\"We're all exposed to a lot of information on a regular basis,\" Lichtenfeld said. \"People tend to not pay a lot of attention to a particular topic until it becomes personally relevant to them.\"</p><p> Dr. Bruce Johnson suggested that  doctors \"need to do a better job disseminating information about personalized medicine.\" Johnson is past president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. </p><p>\"I'm a lung cancer doc. We just had our fifth drug for a specific genomic driver in lung cancer approved last week. That started out from zero in 2004,\" Johnson said.</p><p>\"As opposed to the old days, where drugs worked, on average, for four to six months, these currently are typically working between 10 months to three years,\" Johnson said. \"For patients with lung cancer, it's dramatically transformed their lives. Our job is to get that information out there and make it clear.\"</p><p><b>More and better treatment options</b></p><p>Lichtenfeld noted that the word needs to spread so people will know these drugs might be available to help them.</p><p>\"I had a conversation with someone a couple of weeks ago who had a cancer, had a genetic test done on their cancer, and had a mutation for which there is a clinical trial, but no one had recognized that,\" Lichtenfeld said.</p><p>\"This was what I call an activated patient, an intelligent and engaged person,\" he continued. \"We need to do a better job, nationwide, understanding the options we now have.\"</p><p>The general public also lacks knowledge of some key topics of debate surrounding personalized medicine.</p><p>More than half (60 percent) are unaware that the drugs used in personalized medicine tend to be much more expensive than more conventional treatments like chemotherapy.</p><p>Overall, 46 percent think the costs of personalized medicine for cancer patients will be similar to other available treatment options.  Even among those who are familiar with personalized medicine, this percentage remains the same.</p><p>Further, about one in six (15 percent) thinks the costs of personalized medicine will be significantly lower than other treatment options.</p><p><b>Cost a big factor</b></p><p>In reality, personalized medicine costs a lot. People taking Keytruda pay around $150,000 a year, while Lynparza is estimated to cost more than $234,000 to extend a patient's life by one year. Vitrakvi will cost $32,800 for a 30-day supply of capsules.</p><p>According to Percassi, \"Even those who are familiar with the topic are relatively unaware of the extreme cost difference between personalized medicine and other available treatments.\"</p><p>There's currently a debate in medicine over the cost of these drugs, Lichtenfeld said.</p><p>On the one hand, these cutting-edge medicines are expensive to develop and often only help a small number of patients who carry the specific genetic trait being targeted, Lichtenfeld explained.</p><p>\"You have people who say it's a big risk to develop these drugs and we take on that risk. As a result of taking on that risk, we're entitled to earn a return on that investment,\" Lichtenfeld said.</p><p>But there are also people who feel these drugs are way too expensive, particularly those for which broader uses have been found, he noted. More patients are taking certain drugs but the prices haven't budged.</p><p>\"When you first had immunotherapy available, you had a very small number of patients who were candidates to receive those drugs,\" Lichtenfeld said. \"Now we're in a situation where thousands of patients can receive those drugs, but the price of the drugs has not come down.\"</p><p>People also don't know that by specifically targeting genes and immune functions within the body, personalized medicine avoids the nasty side effects that result from chemotherapy and other harsh treatments.</p><p>Only around half (48 percent) think personalized medicine will have a higher level of success and relatively less side effects among cancer patients than other available treatments. The percentage still only reaches 51 percent among those who are already familiar with personalized medicine, the poll results showed.</p><p>Johnson pointed out that \"it's not only that it works better, but people can return to their lives, to live as well as they can for as long as they can.\"</p><p><b>Potential to save many lives</b></p><p>Despite this lack of information, the poll found that Americans are excited about the prospects for personalized medicine:</p><ul><li>More than two in three (68 percent) say they are excited about the advances in personalized medicine. The percentage climbs to 85 percent among those who are familiar with personalized medicine.</li><li>More than six in 10 agree personalized medicine will save many lives (63 percent) and revolutionize health care (62 percent). This climbs to three-quarters of those who are familiar with personalized medicine (79 percent say it will save many lives, and 76 percent say it will revolutionize health care).</li><li>Just over two in five (41 percent) say personalized medicine makes them less worried about getting diseases like cancer.</li></ul><p>\"We've been through some ups and downs when it comes to personalized medicine,\" Lichtenfeld said. \"The good news from my perspective is we are clearly on an upswing where we have more medicines that are more effective for particular patients. But we have to keep in mind that for a particular medicine, there may only be a small number of patients who are going to benefit from it.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology has more about <a href=\"https://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/how-cancer-treated/personalized-and-targeted-therapies/what-personalized-cancer-medicine\" target=\"_new\">personalized medicine</a>.</p><p><b>About the <i>HealthDay/Harris Poll</i></b></p><p>The survey was conducted online in the United States by The Harris Poll on behalf of <i>HealthDay</i> between Nov. 15-19, 2018 among 2,016 U.S. adults, aged 18 and older.

GAD is an enzyme that spurs the production of a brain chemical involved in movement control.</p><p>In the previous trial, patients had shown improvements in their movement problems after receiving infusions of the GAD gene into the brain.</p><p>What hadn't been clear was precisely why, said researcher Dr. David Eidelberg, who directs the Center for Neurosciences at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, in Manhasset, N.Y.</p><p>So for the new study, Eidelberg's team examined specialized brain scans from 15 of the trial patients. The investigators found an unexpected answer: The gene therapy did not change the abnormal brain circuitry that marks Parkinson's disease.</p><p>Instead, it essentially rewired a small area of the brain, to partially compensate for the faulty circuitry.</p><p>\"It created its own set of circuits,\" Eidelberg explained. \"The disease circuitry continues -- so this is not a cure.\"</p><p>Still, he said, the gene therapy seems to spur new brain connections that can benefit people with Parkinson's.</p><p>The study findings were published online Nov. 28 in <i>Science Translational Medicine</i>.</p><p>Parkinson's disease affects nearly 1 million people in the United States alone, according to the Parkinson's Foundation.</p><p>The root cause is unclear, but as the disease progresses, the brain loses cells that produce dopamine -- a chemical that regulates movement. As a result, people suffer symptoms like tremors, stiff limbs, and balance and coordination problems that gradually worsen over time.</p><p>There are treatments to lessen those symptoms, including medications that boost dopamine levels or mimic the actions of dopamine. Another option for some patients is deep brain stimulation (DBS), where electrodes are implanted in a specific brain area to deliver continuous electrical pulses. It's thought to help by suppressing abnormal electrical activity.</p><p>GAD gene therapy is done by inserting the gene into an inactivated cold virus. That viral \"vector\" is infused into a specific brain area called the subthalamic nucleus -- which is one of the brain regions targeted in DBS treatment.</p><p>Originally, Eidelberg added, researchers thought the gene therapy would work in a \"DBS-like\" way.</p><p>But based on the new findings, that's not the case.</p><p>Dr. Michael Okun is medical director of the Parkinson's Foundation. He called the study \"fascinating.\"</p><p>\"It showed that GAD gene therapy, unlike subthalamic nucleus DBS, did not change the expected Parkinson's disease brain network,\" Okun said. \"Instead, it co-opted adjacent non-motor pathways.\"</p><p>Why does that matter? One reason, according to Okun, is that it offers an \"important lesson\" for the gene therapy field going forward.</p><p>Researchers cannot make assumptions about a therapy's \"mechanism of action,\" he said, based on the brain area it targets.</p><p>Eidelberg made another point: In future studies, researchers could use brain imaging to be sure that patients' symptom improvements are due to a true effect of the gene therapy -- rather than a \"placebo effect.\"</p><p>In the original trial, which involved a few dozen Parkinson's patients, some were randomly assigned to receive GAD gene infusions. The rest underwent a \"sham\" procedure for comparison.</p><p>Over six months, both groups showed improvements in movement symptoms like stiffness and tremor. But the gene therapy group saw greater gains.</p><p>\"It wasn't a slam dunk,\" Eidelberg stressed. \"But they were doing better. And that persisted to the one-year mark.\"</p><p>With any such therapy, there is a theoretical concern that the infused gene will have unintended effects.</p><p>\"What we've seen is that this gene stays put,\" Eidelberg said. \"It doesn't percolate all over the brain.\"</p><p>In the original trial, there were no red flags, according to the researchers. The most common side effects were temporary headaches and nausea.</p><p>Various research teams are looking at different approaches to gene therapy for Parkinson's. The hope, Eidelberg said, is to develop additional options that work for at least some patients -- possibly freeing them from taking daily medications.</p><p>At this point, he noted, there is \"a lot of interest\" in doing a larger, later-stage trial of the GAD therapy. But none has begun yet.</p><p>The current study was funded by Neurologix Inc., the company that developed the gene therapy.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Parkinson's Foundation has more on <a href=\"http://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/treatment\" target=\"_new\">Parkinson's treatment</a>.</p>",

No deaths have been reported, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.</p><p>For lettuce lovers, the advice from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration remains the same: Be sure to check the label on any romaine lettuce, to avoid the risk of E. coli.</p><p>Romaine lettuce sold in stores now carries labels listing the region where the produce was grown, along with its harvest date, the FDA said. By checking these labels, consumers can quickly determine that the produce is safe to eat.</p><p>\"Romaine lettuce that was harvested outside of the Central Coast growing regions of northern and central California does not appear to be related to the current outbreak,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said recently.</p><p>That would include romaine farmed in Arizona, Florida and Mexico, as well as California's Imperial Valley -- lettuce harvested from these areas is OK to eat.</p><p>\"Hydroponically- and greenhouse-grown romaine also does not appear to be related to the current outbreak,\" Gottlieb added. \"There is no recommendation for consumers or retailers to avoid using romaine harvested from these sources.\"</p><p>Information from four restaurants in three different states so far has implicated 10 different distributors, 12 different growers and 11 different farms as potential sources of tainted lettuce, the FDA said Thursday. At this point, the outbreak cannot be explained by a single farm, grower, harvester or distributor, the agency noted.</p><p>If heads of romaine are sold loose, without affixed labels, retailers are being asked to post a notice showing place and date of harvest near the store register.</p><p>Such labeling may become standard going forward, according to an agreement between the FDA and the leafy greens industry, the agency has said.</p><p>In addition, at least 27 cases of E. coli have been reported in Canada.</p><p>\"Through laboratory studies we have identified that the E. coli O157:H7 strain causing the outbreak is similar to one that produced an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the fall of 2017 that also occurred in the U.S. and Canada, which was associated with consumption of leafy greens in the U.S. and specifically romaine lettuce in Canada,\" Gottlieb said.</p><p>So who's most at risk from E. coli?</p><p>Dr. Robert Glatter is an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City who's seen the effects of infection with the gastrointestinal bug firsthand. It's not a minor ailment, he said.</p><p>\"In general, symptoms of E. coli infection generally begin about three to four days after consuming the bacteria, and may include abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and watery or bloody diarrhea, along with fever,\" Glatter said.</p><p>And while healthy people who battle a bout of E. coli typically recover within five to seven days, the illness can be more protracted -- and even deadly -- for people already made vulnerable by chronic disease or advanced age.</p><p>\"People with diabetes, kidney disease or those with cancer or autoimmune disease run the risk of a more severe illness,\" Glatter explained.</p><p>The particular strain of E. coli detected in the current lettuce outbreak -- E. coli O157:H7 -- is particularly nasty, he noted.</p><p>\"Most strains of E. coli do not actually cause diarrhea, but E. coli O157 produces a powerful toxin that injures the inner lining of the small intestine, leading to bloody diarrhea,\" Glatter said. Even a tiny amount of ingested bacteria could spur this type of illness.</p><p>\"It can make people much more ill, and may lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure, in some cases,\" he said.</p><p>Indeed, the CDC has reported one such case already in the latest outbreak.</p><p>In many cases, antibiotics are used to help beat back an E. coli infection, but these drugs can affect the kidneys, Glatter noted.</p><p>\"Antibiotics may be necessary in certain cases, so it's important to see your doctor if you have continued and severe symptoms such as fever, bloody diarrhea, and you are not able to eat or drink,\" he said.</p><p>However, in the case of E. coli O157:H7, \"taking antibiotics may actually increase your risk of developing kidney failure, so it's important to speak with your health care provider if you should develop severe symptoms,\" Glatter advised.</p><p>And if you do think you might be sick with E. coli, or any other foodborne illness, make sure you don't spread it to those near you.</p><p>The bacterium \"can be transmitted person-to-person, so it's vital that anyone who is potentially infected wash their hands thoroughly and not share utensils, cups or glasses,\" Glatter said. \"This also goes for bath towels. Linens also need to be washed in hot water and treated with bleach.\"</p><p>He noted that \"ground beef, unpasteurized milk, fresh produce and contaminated water are common sources of E. coli bacteria.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Find out more about E. coli illness at the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/ecoli-symptoms.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Dec. 10, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Infants born addicted to opioids may be more likely to have smaller heads that might hinder their development, new research suggests.</p><p>\"Babies chronically exposed to opiates [during pregnancy] had a head size about a centimeter smaller\" than babies born to moms not using drugs, said lead researcher Dr. Craig Towers. He's an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology with the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville.</p><p>These infants had three times higher odds of a head size that fell within the lowest 10 percent of all babies in the study, results showed.</p><p>Prior research has shown that infants born with smaller heads typically have a higher rate of mental health and developmental problems, Towers said.</p><p>The findings call into question treatment standards for pregnant women addicted to heroin or other opioids.</p><p>Addicted women are now placed onto drug maintenance therapy and given methadone or buprenorphine throughout their pregnancy to replace the street drugs they've been taking, Towers said.</p><p>Medical societies such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recommended this approach because weaning a pregnant woman off narcotics could cause her to relapse and overdose, harming or killing herself and the fetus.</p><p>\"What we're recommending these moms do, which is get on methadone and buprenorphine, may result in a smaller head size of the baby,\" Towers said. \"This is going to have to make us re-look at what we're doing.\"</p><p>Previous studies already have indicated that babies born addicted to opioids -- a condition called neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) -- might be born with smaller heads due to their drug exposure, Towers said.</p><p>But those studies struggled to separate the effect of opioids from the potential role of other exposures the fetus might have endured. These expecting moms often also drink, smoke and take prescribed and illicit substances, Towers said.</p><p>To nail this down, Towers and his colleagues followed 858 babies from gestation to birth and beyond. About half of the infants were born with NAS. All of the pregnancies were managed at the University of Tennessee Medical Center.</p><p>All the mothers underwent regular drug screens while pregnant, so researchers could take into account the drug exposures from the addicted moms and also could make sure moms in the control group remained drug-negative, Towers said.</p><p>Infants born addicted to opioids had significantly smaller head circumferences, researchers found. In fact, NAS was the only variable significantly linked to smaller head size.</p><p>More than 30 percent of babies born with NAS had a head size that ranked among the smallest in the study, compared with about 12 percent of infants in the control group.</p><p>No one knows for sure why opioid exposure in the womb is linked to smaller head size, but it could be because these drugs work on many neural receptors in the brain, Towers said, and they could alter the way the fetal brain develops.</p><p>Women addicted to street drugs definitely need to be put into rehab, Towers said.</p><p>\"I don't want anyone to think putting them on methadone or buprenorphine is not the way to go. If they continue to use street drugs, that's exponentially worse,\" Towers said. </p><p>\"The street drugs aren't pure, the supply is inconsistent. They don't know how much they're taking. Some patients will think they're taking oxycodone and they're taking oxymophone [another opioid painkiller], which is five times stronger,\" he said.</p><p>These results show that those women and their doctors face a heavy decision after they've stopped taking street opioids, Towers said.</p><p>\"There are risks to the mom if she tapers and detoxes, but there are risks to the baby if she stays on maintenance therapy,\" Towers said. \"There needs to be informed consent so the mother can choose how she wants to go.\"</p><p>The findings were published online Dec. 10 in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i>.</p><p>The new study is going to be \"very controversially received,\" said Dr. Mark Hudak, lead author of an editorial accompanying the study.</p><p>\"I think there's going to be pushback on it, but one has to follow the evidence,\" said Hudak, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Florida College of Medicine.</p><p>\"The whole pillar of opioid maintenance therapy is based upon the fact this is better for the mother and the baby in the sense that the mother is in therapy, she is more closely monitored, she's more likely to access good prenatal care, she's less likely to engage in behaviors that would be harmful to her or the fetus,\" Hudak said.</p><p>There's also \"a correct sense that those women if they undergo detox they're at risk for relapse, which would be harmful to themselves and the fetus. There's no question about that,\" Hudak said.</p><p>But if a mother is highly motivated to get off drugs, doctors will have to weigh these findings in their discussions with her regarding detoxification versus drug maintenance, he said.</p><p>\"You now have to ask, is that the only or the best way for all women,\" Hudak said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has more about <a href=\" https://www.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Obstetric-Practice/Opioid-Use-and-Opioid-Use-Disorder-in-Pregnancy?IsMobileSet=false \" target=\"_new\">opioid use in pregnancy</a>.</p>",

As it clattered across the floor, the couple froze, staring terrified  at one another.</p><p>They weren't worried about the remote.  They were concerned that the noise would startle their babies to death.</p><p>That's what life is like when  doctors say your newborns have only a 50 percent chance of surviving to their  first birthday.</p><p>Carter and John were each born with  a heart defect called long QT syndrome that can cause the heart to go into an  irregular rhythm and could even lead to sudden cardiac arrest.</p><p>\"So, we've got to keep things calm  and quiet around the house,\" Katie said.</p><p>That means no playing peek-a-boo, Katie  and Lance turning their phones to silent and telling friends and family not to  ring the doorbell at their home in Heber Springs, Arkansas.</p><p>They also put box fans in their  rooms as white noise to mask any loud, sudden noises.</p><p>The term &quot;long QT&quot; refers  to an abnormal pattern seen on an&nbsp;electrocardiogram, a test that detects  and records the heart's electrical activity. With each heartbeat, an electrical  signal spreads from the top of the heart to the bottom. As it travels, the  signal causes the heart to contract and pump blood. An EKG records electrical  signals as they move through the heart. Data from the EKG are mapped on a graph,  and each heartbeat is mapped as five distinct electrical waves: P, Q, R, S and  T.</p><p>The day after Carter was born, her heart  rate dropped precipitously, so the doctors gave her an EKG. The results led to her  diagnosis of long QT syndrome. Because the condition is often hereditary, they also  gave John an EKG. He had the condition, too.</p><p>\"The doctor told us, 'Take them  home and love them as best you can. And do everything you can to keep them  alive,'\" Katie said.</p><p>The twins were in the hospital for  10 days, but before they were discharged, everyone in their extended family had  to learn CPR.</p><p>Now 3, they still don't go anywhere  without their own AED, or automated external defibrillator, that could jump-start  a stopped or irregularly beating heart. Katie carries two  one for each child.</p><p>Katie said she was so on edge during  those first weeks that she spent most of the night staring at the baby monitor,  listening to make sure they were still breathing.</p><p>\"You have to stop,\" Lance told her.  \"If something's going to happen, it will happen. God has a plan for them.\"</p><p>The twins are now happy and  relatively healthy.

She's a clinical research psychologist at the University of California, San Francisco. </p><p>\"Traditionally, menopause symptoms have been largely attributed to biological and hormonal changes,\" as well as negative mood, smoking and chronic health conditions such as obesity, Gibson explained in a university news release. </p><p>Now it seems that stress caused by emotional abuse or other trauma may play a role in hormonal changes that affect menopause, the study authors noted. </p><p>Among more than 2,000 middle-aged and older women, the researchers found that one in five had been emotionally abused by a former or current partner. These women had 50 percent higher odds of night sweats and 60 percent higher odds of painful sex, according to the study.</p><p>Moreover, menopausal pain and discomfort were also significantly higher in women who had symptoms of PTSD or were victims of sexual assault or domestic violence, the findings showed.</p><p>Women with PTSD had more than three times the risk of sleep difficulties, and more than twice the odds of vaginal irritation and painful intercourse. And victims of sexual assault or violence by a former or current partner were 40 to 44 percent more likely to experience painful sex, the researchers reported.</p><p>Traumatic exposures, especially emotional abuse and PTSD, were \"surprisingly common\" in this sample of women, Gibson said. </p><p>Emotional abuse included being made fun of, severely criticized, called stupid or worthless, or threats of harm either to the woman herself, her possessions or her pets.</p><p>Among the study group, about 23 percent reported symptoms of PTSD, 16 percent said they were or had been victims of domestic violence, and 19 percent had experienced sexual assault.</p><p>The study can't prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship. Still, the findings suggest that \"routine assessment and recognition of PTSD symptoms and lifetime traumatic exposures when women are seen by health care providers may enhance the effective management of menopausal symptoms,\" Gibson concluded. </p><p>The report was published Nov. 19 in <i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on menopause, visit the <a href=\"https://www.womenshealth.gov/menopause\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 20, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- For Americans with diabetes, high-deductible health insurance plans may lead to delays in diagnosing and treating dangerous blood vessel diseases, a new study suggests. </p><p>\"People with diabetes in high-deductible health insurance plans compared to people with diabetes without high-deductible health insurance had delays in care for macrovascular complications of a month to three months,\" said the study's lead author, Dr. Frank Wharam. He's director of the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute's division of health policy and insurance research. </p><p>Macrovascular complications are problems related to large blood vessels, such as those leading to the heart and brain. These include heart disease, stroke and peripheral artery disease -- a condition that affects blood supply to your limbs. </p><p>People with diabetes have a greater risk of macrovascular complications, and 70 percent of deaths in people with diabetes are linked to these complications, the Harvard study authors said. </p><p>A high-deductible health insurance plan has a deductible of $1,000 or more per year, according to the study. That means someone must pay at least $1,000 of their health care costs before their insurance starts paying for any health care expenses. The researchers said that some plans have deductibles as high as $7,000 per person, per year. </p><p>Nearly half of Americans insured in employer-provided health care are enrolled in high-deductible health insurance plans, according to a new report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p><p>And those high-deductible costs may keep people from seeking care, at least for a little while, the study found. </p><p>To see what effect deductibles had on care for those blood vessel diseases, the researchers reviewed data for up to four years on nearly 34,000 people with diabetes who previously had low-deductible ($500 or less a year) insurance and then had high-deductible insurance ($1,000 or more a year). The researchers compared them to a group of almost 300,000 people with diabetes who had low-deductible health insurance throughout the study period. </p><p>When the study began and both groups had low-deductible health insurance, the researchers saw no difference in how quickly patients received care for symptoms, diagnosis or treatment of macrovascular complications. </p><p>When members of the smaller group transitioned to the high-deductible insurance care, they delayed going to the doctor for their first symptom of macrovascular disease by 1.5 months. They waited almost two months for their first diagnostic test and just over three months for their first procedure-based treatment. </p><p>Wharam said his previous research has shown that a delay for certain problems could lead to serious complications. \"If you have a skin infection and go to the doctor on day one, you could be walking out with a bottle of pills to treat the infection. If you wait till day seven, you could end up hospitalized,\" he explained. </p><p>Dr. Joel Zonszein, director of the Clinical Diabetes Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, said the study highlights shortcomings in insurance coverage in the United States.</p><p>\"This study shows once more the problems we have in our health system. Deductibles are another barrier to treating diabetes and cardiovascular disease,\" said Zonszein, who wasn't involved with the study.</p><p>\"Patients are benefitting less and less from insurance, and we continue to treat the complications of diabetes instead of paying for prevention,\" he said. </p><p>Wharam said if your employer offers you a choice, or you have options on your state's health care exchange, look closely at what your costs for each plan will be. He noted that people with diabetes often have a lot of health care costs. So it might make more sense to pay a higher monthly premium to lower your out-of-pocket costs from deductibles and copays. But it depends on your particular situation. </p><p>He also suggested seeing if your employer offers a health savings plan. These can help spread the cost of health care throughout the year. </p><p>Whatever your health care situation, Wharam said if you need care, you should get it. \"If you have diabetes, our study shows there's a delay in care. It might be conscious or subconscious, but there's a delay. Patients should seek care [without regard to] the cost,\" he said. </p><p>Results of the study were published in the Nov. 20 issue of <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases has more about <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/financial-help-diabetes-care\" target=\"_new\">paying for diabetes care</a>.</p>",

One person in California has died and 63 people have been hospitalized, the CDC reported.</p><p>So far, investigators have been unable to pinpoint a particular source of the salmonella-contaminated raw turkey, and \"it might be widespread in the turkey industry,\" the CDC noted.</p><p>That's all a bit scary, and of course the best way to avoid getting ill is to avoid the recalled brands (see link below).</p><p>But one emergency department physician who sees lots of cases of severe food poisoning says cooks can take steps to eliminate the risk.</p><p>First, \"salmonella can be spread from one person to another, so it's vital to wash your hands before and after preparing or eating food,\" said Dr. Robert Glatter, who practices at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>\"Always remember to thoroughly wash hands, cutting boards, countertops, and utensils with warm, soapy water after they are in contact with raw turkey,\" he added. \"It's best to use a separate cutting board for raw turkey and any other raw meats, to prevent cross-contamination.\"</p><p>When thawing your Thanksgiving bird, do it in the refrigerator, the microwave, or in a sink where cold water is changed every half-hour, Glatter said. \"Do not thaw your turkey by leaving it out on the counter, since this can be a quick way to spread bacteria such as salmonella,\" he said.</p><p>During the cooking process, \"it's important to cook raw turkey thoroughly to kill harmful bacteria such as salmonella,\" Glatter explained. \"Whole turkeys, ground poultry, turkey breasts, and turkey burgers should always be cooked to an internal temperature of 165-degrees Fahrenheit to kill harmful bacteria.\"</p><p>That temperature guide holds true for reheated leftover turkey, too, he said. To be certain, use a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the turkey.</p><p>\"It's important to refrigerate all leftovers at 40-degrees F or colder immediately, but also within two hours of preparation to reduce the risk of food poisoning,\" Glatter said.</p><p>Besides salmonella, another important bacteria to be aware of that may cause food poisoning is <i>Clostridium perfringens</i>, he said.</p><p>\"These bacteria can flourish in cooked foods that are left out at room temperature, and are the second most common bacterial cause of food poisoning. People can develop abdominal cramps along with nausea and vomiting six to 24 hours after eating,\" Glatter noted. </p><p>\"Outbreaks of <i>Clostridium perfringens</i> occur most commonly during the winter months, especially November and December,\" he said, and \"have been associated with foods often prepared during the holidays such as turkey, as well as roasts and other slowly cooked red meats.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For a complete list of the recalled Jennie-O Turkey products, head <a href=\"https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/recall-case-archive/archive/2018/recall-112-2018-release\" target=\"_new\">here</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 21, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- When you first start strength training, almost any weight you lift will bring some results.</p><p>But also use this time to learn proper form, the American College of Sports Medicine advises. As you progress, you can zero in on the best amount of weight as well as the number of repetitions and sets of repetitions you do.</p><p>A general starting guideline for beginners is to choose a weight that you can lift for one set of 12 to 15 repetitions. Note that one repetition or \"rep\" has three parts: lengthening the muscle (the lift), a momentary pause (the contraction) and shortening the muscle (the return to starting position). Then, over the course of a few weeks, build up to two and then three sets, at which point you'll add weight and repeat the process.</p><p>To progress effectively, the American Council on Exercise says to aim for muscle fatigue, which is actually more important than the overall number of reps you do. Muscle fatigue occurs when the muscle being worked is no longer capable of performing any more reps. This is the sign that all the muscle fibers of that muscle have been engaged.</p><p>Lifting heavier weights will lead to muscle fatigue with fewer reps than lower weights, which brings us to the next point: Choosing whether you're training for strength or for muscle definition.</p><p>If you're training for strength, use weights that cause fatigue after a maximum of six repetitions. If you're training for definition, do a higher number of reps with a lower weight and at a slower pace -- you want to hold the contraction phase longer. You still want to achieve muscle fatigue, which in this case will typically occur between eight and 15 reps.</p><p>And always be sure to rest between sets. The heavier the weight you lift, the longer the resting period should be. Figure on one or two minutes of rest with a lighter weight, two or three minutes with a moderate weight, and three or more minutes with a heavy weight.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Council on Exercise has more tips on <a href=\"http://www.acefitness.org/acefit/healthy-living-article/60/5867/how-many-reps-should-you-be-doing\" target=\"_new\">how many reps you should do</a> during your weight workouts to help you reach your goals.</p>",

Also, the results may not apply to women or men outside the health professions.</p><p>For the study, which was partly funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the researchers collected data on nearly 28,000 male health professionals, average age 51. </p><p>Participants completed questionnaires about how many servings of fruits, vegetables and other foods they ate daily at the study's start and every four years thereafter for 20 years. </p><p>Fruits and vegetables contain high levels of antioxidant nutrients, the researchers noted.</p><p>A fruit serving is defined as one cup of fruit or one-half cup of fruit juice. A serving of vegetables is one cup of raw vegetables or two cups of leafy greens.</p><p>The participants were asked about their thinking and memory skills at least four years before the end of the study, at age 73 on average.</p><p>Questions included, \"Do you have more trouble than usual remembering a short list of items, such as a shopping list?\" and \"Do you have more trouble than usual following a  TV program due to your memory?\"</p><p>Changes in memory were considered early signs of mild cognitive impairment. </p><p>Overall, 55 percent said that they still had good thinking and memory skills, 38 percent had moderate skills, and 7 percent had poor thinking and memory skills, the findings showed.</p><p>How great was the protective effect? Men who ate the most vegetables -- about six servings a day -- were 34 percent less likely to develop poor thinking skills than those who ate the least -- just two servings. </p><p>Moreover, daily orange juice drinkers were 47 percent less likely to develop poor thinking skills, compared with men who drank less than one serving a month, the researchers found. This association was seen mostly among the oldest men.</p><p>The study showed that less than 7 percent of frequent veggie eaters developed poor memory function, compared with 8 percent of men who avoided their fruits and greens. The results were similar among frequent and infrequent orange juice drinkers.</p><p>Since fruit juice is usually high in calories, it's generally best to drink a small glass, 4 to 6 ounces, a day, Yuan said.  \"Even better is choosing the whole piece of fruit instead, which contains the added benefit of fiber,\" she suggested.</p><p>Although men who ate the most fruit were also less likely to develop memory problems over time, that association weakened when the researchers accounted for consumption of vegetables, fruit juice, refined grains, legumes and dairy products. </p><p>Long-term habits also appeared to play a role. Those who ate lots of fruits and veggies 20 years before the memory test were less likely to develop thinking and memory problems, whether or not they did so in the six years before the memory test.</p><p>Rebecca Edelmayer is director of scientific engagement at the Alzheimer's Association. She noted that, because this study relies on participants' recall, it is not as rigorous as other studies.</p><p>Still, it makes a valid point that preserving mental health is, to some degree, a matter of lifestyle, just like preventing heart disease, she added. </p><p>\"This is a hot topic of research right now,\" Edelmayer said. </p><p>A healthy diet plus exercise and mental stimulation might reduce your risk for mental decline, she said. \"We see a future where Alzheimer's disease will be treated with a medication, but also life intervention -- like we do with heart disease,\" Edelmayer said. </p><p>The report was published online Nov. 21 in <i>Neurology</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on keeping your brain healthy, visit the <a href=\"https://www.alz.org/help-support/brain_health/10_ways_to_love_your_brain\" target=\"_new\"> Alzheimer's Association</a>.</p>",

But research shows that the adjustment period that follows a second child typically isn't as long.</p><p>For most couples, the first month is the most challenging, but within four months, the quality of the marriage should be back to where it was before the second child arrived.</p><p>As with so many aspects of marriage, good communication is key. More important than the division of childcare responsibilities is clearly talking about who's doing what, as well as working together to find solutions to problems that crop up. It also helps to have a network of support from family and friends.</p><p>Yet even couples who face a difficult transition and experience more disruption in their lives when they have a second child still return to their \"pre-baby normal\" by the fourth post-partum month, studies show.</p><p>Having navigated parenthood for the first time can give you the confidence you need to add to your family. And some advance planning for how you'll manage after your second baby comes will ease the way to growing into a family of four.</p><p>Keep in mind that finding ways to handle the logistics of a new baby and helping your first child adjust to the new member of the family will also help ease the stress that both you and your spouse may feel during this time.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Nemours Foundation has more advice for <a href=\"https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/second-child.html\" target=\"_new\">parenting a second child</a>.</p>",

About 16.1 million Americans provide unpaid care for people with Alzheimer's or other dementias.</p><p>\"When approaching dementia families, I follow the safe and sane rule,\" said Dr. Andrew Duxbury, a geriatrician in the Division of Gerontology, Geriatrics and Palliative Care at University of Alabama at Birmingham.</p><p>\"Everything we do needs to make the patient safe and the family sane. In terms of safety, it boils down into the big four: meals, wheels, bills and pills,\" he explained in a university news release.</p><p>In terms of meals, caregivers need to consider whether the person is capable of preparing food, eating healthy and appropriate amounts of food, and has the awareness that they need to eat, Duxbury said. \"If any link in that chain breaks, the person may not eat,\" he said.</p><p>When it comes to kitchen safety, the \"biggest issue is leaving things on the stove and forgetting to turn the oven off; but if cooking is part of someone's routine, let them cook on their own while monitoring what they are doing from another room,\" he said.</p><p>\"Think about it this way: Would you let your 12-year-old make dinner? You may, but you would definitely be in the next room listening for anything that could go wrong,\" Duxbury said.</p><p>Other suggestions include planning meals that require minimal preparation or can be made in the microwave; removing scissors and knives from the countertop and drawers; putting labels on kitchen cabinets; and disguising the garbage disposal switch to prevent someone from turning it on accidentally.</p><p>It's not safe for patients with late-stage dementia to prepare food on the stove or in the oven, Duxbury said.</p><p>When it comes to getting out of the house, the loss of independence caused by having to give up driving can be difficult for dementia patients.</p><p>\"A lot of times, an older man may just want to have the car keys, feel them in his pocket and see the car in the driveway,\" Duxbury said. \"You can let him have the keys, just not the key to the actual car. Give him the keys to a different car or remove the car key from his set of keys. This way, he has the keys, hears them jingle in his pocket and sees his car, but can't go anywhere.\"</p><p>If a person can no longer drive, caregivers need to ensure there is another source of transportation, especially for medical appointments. Arrange to have medications, groceries or meals delivered.</p><p>Evaluate and monitor the person's finances to make sure he or she has  enough money to pay bills and is not being taken advantage of or scammed, Duxbury advised.</p><p>Many seniors take multiple medications. Those with dementia often forget to take their pills or take pills together that can cause harmful side effects. Caregivers need to ensure their loved one is correctly managing their medications and going to medical appointments. It's also important to keep an eye on the person's other health issues.</p><p>To help your loved one, set up a pillbox with a week's worth of pills, sorted by day. Some pillboxes have timers and locks you can set to prevent him or her from taking the wrong day's dose.</p> <p>Duxbury said most people with dementia think they're fine. </p><p>\"Families need to remember that a person with dementia does not live in the same reality that we live in,\" he said. \"They live in a reality of their brain's dementia. These individuals may have completely different perceptions of the world around them and what it means. &hellip; We have to accept their reality for what it is.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Aging has more about <a href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers/caregiving\" target=\"_new\">Alzheimer's caregiving</a>.</p>",

As such, the Asian longhorned tick is considered \"a new and emerging disease threat,\" according to a team led by C. Ben Beard, of the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases.</p><p>Ticks are already the bane of Americans everywhere, with bites being prime causes of severe illness such as Lyme disease, babesiosis, Powassan encephalitis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and other infections.</p> <p>Now the newly introduced species brings the specter of another very serious illness, called \"severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus\" (SFTSV). This tick-borne disease quickly brings on serious hemorrhagic fever. It first emerged in China but has since been spotted in South Korea and Japan.</p><p>As described by Chinese researchers in a 2011 issue of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>, symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea and anemia. In some cases multiple organ failure can result, and 12 percent of cases prove fatal.</p><p>The tick can also spread a virus known to cause Japanese spotted fever in humans, another potentially fatal illness that brings very high fever and red rash.  The CDC believes the insect can also be a vector for numerous other ailments, including Powassan virus.</p><p>Beard's team stressed that, so far, no such cases of SFTSV or Japanese spotted fever linked to the Asian longhorned tick have been reported in the United States.</p><p>Importation of the ticks has long been a worry for U.S. health officials.</p><p> \"Before 2017, <i>H. longicornis</i> ticks were intercepted at U.S. ports of entry at least 15 times on imported animals and materials,\" which were then quarantined, Beard's team noted.</p><p>The first report of the tick being found in a <i>non</i>-quarantined animal in the United States involved a sheep in New Jersey in 2017, the new CDC report said. Since then, 53 more cases have emerged including 23 from domestic animals, 13 from wildlife, and two from humans. Fifteen more samples of the tick were found from environmental sampling -- tick traps, for example -- in grass or other vegetation.</p><p>Right now the tick seems localized to Eastern states, but its range could spread.</p><p>Steps are already being put into place to try to identify and limit the tick's spread, Beard's group noted. </p><p>\"Many state and federal agencies are developing and disseminating information for stakeholders, including development of hotlines, and some states are identifying ticks submitted by the public,\" the team reported.</p><p>The new report was published in the Nov. 30 issue of the CDC's <i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The CDC has more on the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/longhorned-tick/index.html\" target=\"_new\"> Asian longhorned tick</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 26, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- High-impact hits may affect the brain development of children and teens after just one season of football, preliminary research suggests. </p><p>The study compared functional MRI scans taken pre- and post-season. The researchers saw more gray matter volume in those who had high-impact hits  -- but no concussions -- over the season. </p><p>More gray matter indicates that the brain might not be working as well as it could be. </p><p>The brain contains an abundance of connections between nerve cells (synapses) that are constantly changing. New connections are made, while unused ones are pruned away. The process can be compared to tree trimming -- if you prune dead branches off a tree, it allows for healthy growth. The pruning that occurs in the brain also allows for healthy growth, the researchers said. </p><p>\"The brain becomes more efficient after gray matter pruning,\" explained study author Gowtham Krishnan Murugesan. </p><p>The study included 60 youth and high school football players aged 9 to 18, said Murugesan, a research assistant in the radiology department at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. None had had a concussion or any known developmental, neurological or psychiatric disorders. </p><p>The players' high-tech helmets were outfitted with accelerometers -- sensors that measure the severity, location and direction of impacts to the head. </p><p>The researchers used information from the sensors to divide the group into high or low impact players. Twenty-four players were considered  high-impact players, and 36 were low-impact. </p><p>In addition to looking at gray matter volume, the researchers also studied an area of the brain called the default mode network (DMN). This is a network of regions deep within the brain's gray matter. \"The DMN network is important for planning and controlling social behaviors,\" Murugesan said. </p><p>The researchers saw a significant increase in power in this area for the high-impact group. Murugesan said that if gray matter pruning is happening as it should, the power should be reduced because the brain would be working more efficiently. </p><p>It isn't yet clear if the effects on gray matter are temporary. Murugesan said that after not playing for nine months (off-season), the players' brains may go back to what they were at the start of the season. </p><p>Dr. Bruce Silverman is a neurologist at Ascension Providence Hospital in Southfield, Mich. \"In people who've had repeated head traumas -- measured by accelerometers -- brain pruning is not as effective,\" said Silverman, who wasn't involved in the study. </p><p>This study showed it doesn't necessarily take major knockouts or concussions to cause changes in the brain, he noted.  </p><p>However, neither expert said it's time for kids to hang up their football gear. Any potential long-term effects aren't yet known. </p><p>In the meantime, Murugesan and his co-authors hope to make play safer. The data from the helmets suggested that a lot of the high-impact hits occurred during practice. </p><p>\"Many players are getting more impact during practice,\" Murugesan said. One way to make play safer, he added, might be to replace some high-impact practice drills with low-impact ones. </p><p>Silverman agreed. \"Practice could be a greater time of trauma than the game itself. In practice, players get pushed harder to be tougher for the game. The physical nature of practice may need to be toned down a bit,\" he said. </p><p>Also, part of the problem may be that players are faster now, he added. </p><p>\"We've been making pads less encumbering,\" Silverman said. \"In the past, you had something that slowed you down and didn't allow you to run as fast as the new equipment does.\" </p><p>Silverman said parents should make sure that young football players are well-equipped with helmets and pads. The coaching staff should be trained to monitor and evaluate kids after any type of head injury, and not put kids back into play too soon, he noted. </p><p>The study was scheduled for presentation Monday at the Radiological Society of North America meeting, in Chicago. Findings presented at meetings are typically viewed as preliminary until they're published in a peer-reviewed journal. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about head injuries in sports from the <a href=\"https://www.aans.org/Patients/Neurosurgical-Conditions-and-Treatments/Sports-related-Head-Injury\" target=\"_new\">American Association of Neurological Surgeons</a>.</p>",

To have a happy and healthy holiday season, we should all take a few moments to pause, and be mindful of what our body and mind are telling us,\" he added in a hospital news release.</p><p>It's important to set realistic expectations and goals. Say no to social activities, chores and events when you need to, and be sure your priority is on you, your family and your health.</p><p>Holiday parties and shopping can expose you to illness-causing germs. Carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with you or wash your hands frequently with warm water and soap.</p><p>Be sure to drink plenty of water. Dehydration can increase levels of the stress hormone cortisol,  leading to feelings of anxiety, exhaustion and irritability, according to Cooke.</p><p>Be active. Try to get at least 30 minutes of outdoor activity every day. For example, go for a run, take a walk with your family, or go ice skating.</p><p>It's OK to indulge in some holiday treats, but try to maintain a healthy diet most of the time. For snacks, focus on nutritious items like fresh fruits and vegetables, Cooke said.</p><p>Find time to rest and relax to reduce stress and keep your immune system strong. Have an herbal tea, meditate or read a book to wind down. And try to get eight hours of sleep each night.</p><p>Tell family and friends that you're grateful for having them in your life. Expressing gratitude can improve positive feelings, fight depression and strengthen relationships, Cooke said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/family/holiday/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">holiday health and safety tips</a>.</p>",

But less severe infections treated with drugs were also linked to an increased risk for mental disorders, the researchers found. </p><p>Specifically, they found that children who had been hospitalized with an infection had an 84 percent increased risk of being diagnosed with a mental disorder and a 42 percent increased risk of being prescribed drugs to treat the disorder.</p><p>It seems that infections and the inflammatory reaction that follows can affect the young brain and be part of the process of developing mental disorders, Kohler-Forsberg explained.</p><p>\"This can, however, also be explained by other causes, such as some people having a genetically higher risk of suffering more infections and mental disorders,\" he said.</p><p>How infections increase the risk for mental illness isn't clear, Kohler-Forsberg said.</p><p>The frequent infections that everyone experiences do not generally harm the body or the brain, he said. In fact, infections are necessary to develop the immune system.</p><p>\"But for some individuals, an infection can affect the brain and lead to lasting damage, although this is a rare event,\" Kohler-Forsberg said.</p><p>For the study, researchers collected data on more than 1 million people born in Denmark between 1995 and 2012. Among these, nearly 4 percent were hospitalized for a mental disorder and more than 5 percent were taking drugs to treat their condition.</p><p>Kohler-Forsberg's team found that infections treated with medications, especially antibiotics, were associated with an increased risk for mental illness. The extent of the risk varied by the type of mental disorder. Bacterial infections conferred the highest risk.</p><p>The mental conditions that were most commonly linked with having been hospitalized for an infectious disease include schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, personality and behavior disorders, mental retardation, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and tics, the researchers reported. </p><p>\"A better understanding of the role of infections and antimicrobial therapy in the development of mental disorders might lead to new methods for the prevention and treatment of these devastating disorders,\" Kohler-Forsberg said. </p><p>He cautioned again that these are general associations and do not say much about any single infection.</p><p>\"Therefore, parents should generally not be worried, Kohler-Forsberg said. \"We also showed in a different paper that cognition is not affected by the number of infections in childhood.\"</p><p>Research over the last few decades has revealed many complex interactions between the mind and the immune system, said Dr. Timothy Sullivan, chair of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City. </p><p>These include correlations between inflammation and symptoms of depression, as well as gut microbes and emotional health. Strong associations between mental illness and some physical conditions -- such as heart disease, cancer and arthritis -- also exist, he said.</p><p>\"As yet, although we have identified some of the cellular and physiological mechanisms through which these interactions may occur, we have not fully elucidated the links, and some in the scientific community, as a result, remain unsure that these observations are anything more than coincidence,\" Sullivan said.</p><p>As insights from the developing knowledge of the human genome and gene functions increase, \"understanding the impact of even routine illnesses on the risk for mental illness will be a crucial component of scientific inquiry, and will allow us to one day -- hopefully soon -- anticipate and treat those risks directly,\" he added.</p><p>The report was published online Dec. 5 in the journal <i>JAMA Psychiatry</i>.  </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Mental Health has more on the link between <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/directors/thomas-insel/blog/2010/microbes-and-mental-illness.shtml\" target=\"_new\">infections and mental illness</a>.</p>",

This combination of drugs puts patients at risk of overdose, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Forty-four percent of the risky overlapping prescriptions were written by more than one prescriber, according to the Idaho State University study. It was presented Tuesday at an American Society for Health-System Pharmacists meeting, in Anaheim, Calif.</p><p>\"Patients with chronic pain are often under the care of several different physicians to manage their different disease states,\" explained researcher Catherine Oliphant, a professor of pharmacy practice at Idaho State.</p><p>\"This co-management can lead to patients receiving unintentional prescription combinations that put them at higher risk for an opioid overdose,\" she explained in a society news release.</p><p>But 56 percent of the dangerous drug combinations were written by the same prescriber, which shows the need for continued education on appropriate opioid prescribing, Oliphant said.</p><p>She noted that pharmacists are in a position to intervene when they identify patients with overlapping prescriptions for opioids and benzodiazepines or other central nervous system depressants.</p><p>Pharmacists can promote communication between prescribers, educate patients and prescribers on the risks of dangerous drug combinations, and prescribe an opioid overdose treatment such as naloxone, Oliphant said.</p><p>Research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse has more about <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/prescription-opioids\" target=\"_new\">prescription opioids</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Dec. 18, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Folks feeling lonely as the holidays approach have a lot of company, a new study suggests.</p><p>Loneliness appears to be widespread among Americans, affecting three out of every four people, researchers have found.</p><p>Further, loneliness appears to spike at specific times during adulthood. Your late 20s, mid-50s and late 80s are times when you are most at risk of feeling lonely.</p><p>Wisdom appeared to be a strong factor in avoiding feelings of loneliness, the researchers said. People who had qualities of wisdom -- empathy, compassion, control over their emotions, self-reflection -- were much less likely to feel lonely.</p><p>The extent of loneliness detected in the study was a \"surprise, because this was a normal population,\" said senior researcher Dr. Dilip Jeste, a professor of psychiatry and neuroscience with the University of California, San Diego. \"This was not a group of people at high risk for emotional problems.\"</p><p>On the other hand, the peaks of loneliness discovered in the study made sense to Jeste.</p><p>\"These are three periods of life that are full of stress for different reasons,\" Jeste said.</p><p>For this study, Jeste and his colleagues surveyed 340 average adults, aged 27 to 101, living in San Diego. Each person's loneliness was measured using several different measures, including a 20-point loneliness scale developed at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).</p><p>About 76 percent of people showed serious signs of loneliness based on results from the UCLA questionnaire, with 54 percent gauged as moderately lonely and 22 percent ranked as highly lonely.</p><p>Loneliness might not mean what you think it means, however.</p><p>\"There's a misperception that loneliness means social isolation,\" Jeste said. \"Loneliness is subjective. It is what you feel. The definition of loneliness is distress because of a discrepancy between actual social relationships and desired social relationships. There's a discrepancy between what I want and what I have.\"</p><p>Thus, people can feel lonely even if they are married and have a network of friends, if in their hearts they feel like it's not enough, Jeste explained.</p><p>That said, highly lonely people were more likely to be single, live alone and have a personal income less than $35,000, the investigators found.</p><p>The observed peak time periods for loneliness reflected ages that can be challenging in a person's life, Jeste noted:</p><ul><li>The late 20s are a time when people are making choices that will affect the rest of their lives, such as their career, their choice of life partner and where they will settle. \"It really puts a lot of responsibility on you,\" Jeste said. \"It's a really difficult period. And when you compare yourself to others, you might feel you aren't doing as well as your peers.\"</li> <li>The mid-50s are when people tend to experience a mid-life crisis, as signs of aging highlight the fact that their time on Earth is limited. \"You see some of your friends dying, sometimes family members,\" Jeste said. \"You become aware of your mortality for the first time.\"</li><li>The late 80s are a time of increased helplessness. Half of people at this age have dementia, and their physical abilities are in decline. \"Often you've lost your spouse, and you don't have many people left around you, either family or friends,\" Jeste said.</li></ul><p>People suffering from loneliness tended to have more depression, anxiety and stress in their lives, the study authors added.</p><p>And according to Craig Sawchuk, chair of Integrated Behavioral Health at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., loneliness and its accompanying emotional turmoil can harm a person's physical health. </p><p>People who are lonely can tend to become homebodies, Sawchuk  said. He was not involved with the study but was familiar with the findings.</p><p>\"If we're finding loneliness increases, you might see an increase in sedentary lifestyle as well,\" which can lead to high blood pressure, diabetes and heart problems, Sawchuk said. \"These mental effects do have a wear and tear on us physically.\"</p><p>Wisdom appears to serve as a buffer against loneliness, with specific components that provide important context in dealing with those feelings.</p><p>For example, Jeste suggested, people better able to control their emotions can more capably handle anxiety related to loneliness, and those who self-reflect have a greater understanding of why they feel lonely.</p><p>Spirituality and empathy help a person feel more connected with others, he added. \"You know you are part of a much larger cosmos. You are never alone,\" Jeste said. \"There is something else besides you that will always be there.\"</p><p> Julianne Holt-Lunstad is a professor of psychology and neuroscience with Brigham Young University in Utah. She said that while self-understanding is important, people fighting feelings of loneliness should not underestimate the importance of getting out there and interacting with others who share their values or interests.</p><p>Social connection can be thought of as a fundamental need for human beings, like food and water, Holt-Lunstad added. If so, loneliness is similar to hunger and thirst -- a motivator for people to meet that need.</p><p>\"If it's the motive to seek out social connection or that recognition we are lacking that connection, it seems like that should be a part of the solution rather than just trying to suppress the symptoms,\" she said.</p><p>But since loneliness is subjective, the solution to overcoming those feelings will be completely personal to each individual, Holt-Lunstad noted. For example, she pointed to one study that found getting involved in social groups ranked high both as what had worked for people and what had not worked to combat loneliness.</p><p>\"The solution might not be the same for everybody,\" Holt-Lunstad said.</p><p>The new study was published online Dec. 18 in the journal <i>International Psychogeriatrics</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Association for Psychological Science has more about <a href=\"https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/understanding-loneliness-through-science.html\" target=\"_new\">loneliness</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Jan. 7, 2019 (American Heart Association) -- A new study suggests that high levels of inorganic phosphate -- a preservative widely used in certain sodas, packaged meats and other processed foods -- may be a reason why the U.S. population isn't as physically active as it used to be.</p> <p>Researchers from UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas looked at the effect of phosphate on both mice and humans and found each had similar associations with reduced activity level and increased sedentary time.</p> <p>Phosphate is a particle that comes from the mineral phosphorus, which the body needs to build healthy teeth and bones. It can be found naturally in some foods, including nuts, eggs and dairy products. But inorganic phosphate frequently gets added to certain foods to enhance appearance and flavor or increase its shelf life.</p> <p>An estimated 40 percent to 70 percent of top-selling grocery items, including cola drinks, prepared frozen foods, dry food mixes, packaged meat and bakery products contain phosphate additives, notes the study published Monday in the American Heart Association journal <i>Circulation</i>. As a result, up to 25 percent of U.S. adults consume threefold to fourfold the recommended daily allowance of phosphate on a regular basis.</p> <p>To mirror that type of exposure, researchers took two groups of healthy mice and fed them similar diets, except one group was fed more than three times as much phosphate.</p> <p>After 12 weeks, the mice on the high phosphate diet spent less time on the treadmill and took in less oxygen when they did exercise compared to the mice in the control group. They also had a reduced ability to burn fat and showed changes in more than 5,000 genes that aid in processing fatty acids and cell metabolism, which the body uses as an energy source.</p> <p>In a separate part of the study that looked at humans, researchers found a similar correlation between high phosphate levels and reduced physical activity.</p> <p>Analyzing data on 1,603 healthy people whose activity was monitored with a fitness tracker for seven days, researchers found that higher serum phosphate levels  or the amount of phosphate in the blood  were associated with less time spent on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and more time being sedentary.</p> <p>The federal government currently doesn't require phosphate levels to be included on food labels, making it difficult for people to monitor phosphate intake, said Dr. Wanpen Vongpatanasin, the study's senior author and a professor of medicine at UT Southwestern Medical Center.</p> <p>\"I think it might be about time for us to push the food industry to put this on labels so that we can see how much phosphate goes into our food, but this is just the beginning\" and more research is needed to support the effort, she said.</p> <p>Previous studies have linked higher phosphate intake to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and death, particularly in people with kidney disease.</p> <p>Normal kidneys eliminate excess phosphate from the body, which is why an overload of phosphate is a problem for people with impaired kidneys, said Dr. Myles Wolf, professor of medicine and chief of nephrology at Duke University School of Medicine in North Carolina.</p> <p>The new study is \"an important addition to a growing body of work suggesting the deleterious effects of consuming an abundance of phosphate in the diet,\" said Wolf, who was not connected with the research.</p> <p>\"I think the animal data is outstanding,\" he said. \"It's really fascinating, and I think one can take those animal findings and now do some additional human research that would get more at the specifics the study's authors are hypothesizing.\"</p> <p>Wolf said one big strength of the study is that it helps alert the public to how widespread phosphate additives are.</p> <p>\"There's relatively low awareness of dietary phosphate as a potential harmful food constituent in excessive amounts,\" he said. The study adds to \"a growing chorus that suggests more attention should be paid to dietary phosphate consumption and its supplementation by the food industry in the food supply.\"</p>",

            "Body__c": "<!--Spanish ID: 740999 --><p>THURSDAY, Dec. 27, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The scourge of opioid addiction and related deaths cut through American society again in 2018, capturing headlines and making it the year's top health story.</p><p>Rates of opioid-linked fatal overdoses have nearly doubled over the past decade and topped 70,000 in 2017, according to data released in November by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Many of those tragic deaths occurred among young adults and were linked to fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that's 50 times more potent than heroin.</p><p>All of this means that for three years in a row, U.S. average life expectancy reversed a long-term upward trend and actually dropped -- from nearly 79 years in 2014 to 78.6 years now.</p><p>\"We've been talking about the fact that our children will live less long than we will, and that's clearly coming to pass,\" said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.</p><p>Other top health stories of 2018, as compiled by editors at <i>HealthDay</i>:</p><p><b>Vaping rates soar among the young</b></p><p>Even as smoking rates fell to all-time lows among teens, another form of addictive nicotine intake, the e-cigarette, was poised to take its place.</p><p>The latest federal data on youth behaviors found vaping among American teenagers rising dramatically in 2018, with nearly two of every five high school seniors (37 percent) reporting they've tried an e-cigarette during the past year. That's up from 28 percent the year before.</p><p>Many worry that the sleek \"cool\" factor of the leading e-cigarette brand, Juul, may be luring the young to take up vaping -- which many experts worry is a merely a bridge to traditional smoking.</p><p>Seeking to reverse these trends, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in November announced that it would take steps to limit or ban access to flavored e-cigarettes, much favored by teens.</p><p><b>A deadly flu season</b></p><p>A virulent dominant strain of influenza, relatively low uptake of the flu shot, and a poor match between the vaccine and the dominant strains of virus combined to make 2017-2018 one of the worst flu seasons in recent memory.</p><p>Over 80,000 people -- many of them the frail elderly or the very young -- died from complications of flu, the CDC reported, and hospitals were jammed with patients battling the virus.</p><p>So far, the new season seems milder, but CDC experts warn that influenza can still bring surprises, so they urge vaccination.</p><p><b>With growing acceptance, marijuana use rises</b></p><p>By 2018, 33 U.S. states had legalized marijuana for medical use, and neighboring Canada also legalized the drug for recreational use. Aging baby boomers seemed to embrace pot, and in a <i>HealthDay/Harris Poll</i> conducted in July, 85 percent of U.S. adults agreed that pot should be allowed for medical purposes, while 57 percent supported recreational use.</p><p>One legal marijuana derivative product, medicinal CBD oil, became hugely popular in 2018. A form of CBD liquid, Epidiolex, became the first marijuana-derived drug ever approved by the FDA. It is used to help ease certain forms of epilepsy.</p><p>Not everyone was happy about widening access to marijuana, however.</p><p>\"The problem here is we're at the beginning of this massive experiment with unknown outcomes,\" said Fred Muench, president and CEO of the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids.</p><p><b>Obamacare holds on another year</b></p><p>Despite promises by the Trump White House and Republicans in Congress to repeal it, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) -- also known as \"Obamacare\" -- kept providing health care to Americans in 2018.</p><p>In fact, despite pessimistic mid-year predictions, ACA sign-ups for 2018 held steady at near 12 million, and were only down slightly for 2019.</p><p>However, threats to the program remained: In December, a federal judge in Texas deemed the ACA unconstitutional -- a ruling that could end up before the Supreme Court.</p><p><b>Gene-targeted 'personalized' medicine brings new hope against cancer</b></p><p>When former President Jimmy Carter announced that a gene-focused immunotherapy drug called Keytruda had pushed back his metastatic brain tumor, Americans began to understand the potential of this new generation of medicines.</p><p>Drugs like Keytruda, Yervoy, Opdivo and others target genes specific to an individual patient's tumor. This greatly improves treatment success rates while minimizing side effects.</p><p>The field is expanding to a wide range of drugs fighting a host of tumor types, said one oncologist.</p><p>\"I'm a lung cancer doc. We just had our fifth drug for a specific genomic driver in lung cancer approved last week. That started out from zero in 2004,\" noted Dr. Bruce Johnson, past president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.</p><p><b>Tainted lettuce puts a damper on Thanksgiving</b></p><p>Americans sitting down for their Thanksgiving dinners had to forgo Caesar salads this year. That's because E. coli contamination in irrigation water at one California farm (but possibly more) caused the FDA to urge Americans to avoid the leafy green.</p><p>The outbreak caused 59 illnesses so severe that dozens were sent to the hospital, although no deaths were reported.</p><p><b>Big changes to common cancer screens</b></p><p>In May, expert cancer panels made two big revisions to screening protocols used by millions.  First, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) re-opened the door for men to once again use the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test for prostate cancer, saying that men aged 55 to 69 should decide for themselves whether to undergo the test.</p><p>Next, the American Cancer Society lowered the starting age for colon cancer screening from 50 to 45, citing a rise in the cancer among the young.</p><p>Finally, in August, another USPSTF panel said that women over 30 now have a range of cervical cancer screening options. These include an HPV (human papillomavirus) test just once every five years --  dispensing with the traditional Pap test.</p><p><b>Mysterious 'polio-like' illness strikes kids</b></p><p>Cases of a rare but devastating illness called acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) grew among U.S. children again in 2018, with numbers affected by the paralyzing illness approaching 300 by year's end. The condition appears linked to infection with enteroviruses, which typically cause only mild illnesses such as common colds. For now, AFM's origins and treatment remain unclear, the CDC has said.</p>",

The strategy was inspired by hospital wound care. Because putting zinc oxide on open surgical wounds reduces corynebacteria and the bad smell it creates, researchers thought it might also make an effective deodorant.</p><p>The study authors said their small, early trial with 30 healthy volunteers stopped stink cold. That's because zinc oxide kills the two types of bacteria that cause underarm odor -- Corynebacterium spp. and Staphylococcus spp.</p><p>\"Even though it contained no fragrance like conventional deodorants, the participants could identify that it had neutralized any bad odor under the arm where it was applied,\" said lead researcher Dr. Magnus Agren, of the Copenhagen Wound Healing Center at Bispebjerg Hospital, in Denmark.</p> <p>But don't breathe easy just yet: This fragrance-free deodorant isn't yet available, though Colgate-Palmolive, who makes it and paid for the trial, hopes to bring it to market.</p><p>The findings were scheduled for presentation Saturday at a meeting of the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. </p><p>For the 13-day study, 30 men and women volunteered to try zinc oxide. They were randomly assigned to have zinc oxide in one armpit and a placebo in the other.</p><p>The researchers took samples of the study participants' underarm bacteria and caused small wounds in the area. Participants were asked if they detected a difference in scent between their left and right armpit and, if so, which smelled better.</p><p>Compared with placebo, levels of odor-causing bacteria were significantly lower with zinc oxide, the findings showed. It also reduced the redness caused by the wounds and promoted healing, the investigators noted in a meeting news release. </p><p>Research presented at meetings is typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>To learn more about perspiration, visit the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/sweat.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institutes of Health</a>.</p>",

Acknowledge your emotions, but don't let them dictate the conversation. Be aware of any negative body language you're showing, such as avoiding eye contact, a negative facial expression, a harsh tone of voice or angry posture. Think about it: Crossed arms don't convey open-mindedness. A caring tone and using humor can help diffuse tension as you start to talk.</p><p>Be specific as you use words to reframe the situation and honestly express your feelings without anger or other emotions. Then do the most important thing: Listen to the other person's viewpoint and make sure you understand it by repeating it.

She is an assistant professor at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.</p><p>People who had the most volatile incomes between 1990 and 2005 were a little more than twice as likely to develop heart disease and 78 percent more likely to die from any cause during the following decade, compared with people with the most stable incomes, Elfassy and her colleagues found.</p><p>Further, people who suffered two or more income drops during that same period were 2.5 times more likely to develop heart disease and 92 percent more likely to die from any cause, compared with those who never had their income go down, the study findings showed.</p><p>The study only found an association and couldn't prove that income fluctuations caused health issues.</p><p>However, unstable income can affect a person's health in a number of ways, said Donna Arnett, past president of the American Heart Association and dean of the University of Kentucky College of Public Health.</p><p>People under stress tend to have increased blood pressure and inflammation, likely due to higher levels of the fight-or-flight hormone cortisol, Arnett said. Their ability to process blood sugar also is hampered.</p><p>Those caught in an income squeeze can also have their health affected by more practical problems, Arnett added.</p><p>\"Could it be you can't take your medications because you can't afford them, you can't afford to see a physician, you can't afford the right diet?\" Arnett said. \"I think it's a multitude of reasons that could be contributing to this finding.\"</p><p> Elfassy pointed out that previous studies have linked income to a person's risk of heart disease, but those studies tend to focus on income at one single point in time.</p><p>\"As we all know, income changes throughout life,\" Elfassy said. \"For this study, we were interested in changes in income over time and how that is associated with disease and mortality.\"</p><p>To explore that topic, the researchers turned to a large-scale ongoing heart study being conducted in four urban areas in the United States: Chicago; Minneapolis; Birmingham, Ala.; and Oakland, Calif. The investigators gathered data on nearly 4,000 participants who were between the ages of 23 and 35 back in 1990.</p><p>As part of the study, people reported their income five times between 1990 and 2005, at regular intervals. The researchers assessed income volatility based on large swings in income.</p><p>The team then tracked these people to see if income changes were associated with their health outcomes.</p><p>Only about 5 percent of the sample had absolutely no changes in income during the 15-year period, while about 90 percent experienced at least one pay increase, the researchers reported.</p><p>\"Individuals with higher income volatility were more likely to be women, black, have lower income in general, and less likely to be married,\" Elfassy said. \"They also had less years of education than those who did not have income fluctuation.\"</p><p>So, what should you do if you're someone with highly unstable income?</p><p> Arnett said that it's difficult to remain heart-healthy when you're facing the stress of a job loss or pay cut.</p><p>\"When you're in those situations that are stressful, it's hard to do what is best. You go into survival mode. You may be more likely to have a beer and have a cigarette for stress relief,\" Arnett added.</p><p>On the other hand, Elfassy said, getting a little exercise can help ward off the harmful effects of a dissolving paycheck.</p><p>\"You don't need to take an expensive yoga class. Simply going for a 15-minute walk every day would have benefits in and of itself. There are low-cost ways to adequately obtain physical activity,\" Elfassy said.</p><p>The study was published online Jan. 7 in the journal <i>Circulation</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart Association has more about <a href=\" https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/stress-and-heart-health \" target=\"_new\">stress and heart disease</a>.</p>",

But now the source seems to be \"end of season\" lettuce, harvested somewhere in the Central Coast regions of central and northern California.</p><p>And, \"harvesting of romaine lettuce from this region has [already]  ended for the year,\" Gottlieb noted.</p><p>So, starting as early as this week, romaine lettuce sold in stores will carry labels listing the region where the produce was grown, along with its harvest date, the FDA said. By checking these labels, consumers can quickly determine that the produce is safe to eat.</p><p>\"Romaine lettuce that was harvested outside of the Central Coast growing regions of northern and central California does not appear to be related to the current outbreak,\" Gottlieb stressed.</p><p>That would include romaine farmed in Arizona, Florida and Mexico, as well as California's Imperial Valley -- lettuce harvested from these areas is OK to eat.</p><p>\"Hydroponically- and greenhouse-grown romaine also does not appear to be related to the current outbreak,\" Gottlieb added. \"There is no recommendation for consumers or retailers to avoid using romaine harvested from these sources.\"</p><p>If heads of romaine are sold loose, without affixed labels, retailers are being asked to post a notice showing place and date of harvest near the store register.</p><p>Such labeling may become standard going forward, according to an agreement between the FDA and the leafy greens industry, the agency said.</p><p>So far, 43 people across 12 states have been sickened in this latest outbreak of E. coli, with onset in the last case occurring on Oct. 31.</p> <p>Twenty-two more cases have been reported in Canada. No deaths have yet been reported in the outbreak.</p><p>\"Through laboratory studies we have identified that theE. coliO157:H7 strain causing the outbreak is similar to one that produced an outbreak ofE. coliO157:H7 in thefall of 2017 that also occurred in the U.S. and Canada, which was associated with consumption of leafy greens in the U.S. and specifically romaine lettuce in Canada,\" Gottlieb said.</p><p>So who's most at risk from E. coli?</p><p>Dr. Robert Glatter is an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City who's seen the effects of infection with the gastrointestinal bug firsthand. It's not a minor ailment, he said.</p><p>\"In general, symptoms of E. coli infection generally begin about three to four days after consuming the bacteria, and may include abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and watery or bloody diarrhea, along with fever,\" Glatter said.</p><p>And while healthy people who battle a bout of E. coli typically recover within five to seven days, the illness can be more protracted -- and even deadly -- for people already made vulnerable by chronic disease or advanced age.</p><p>\"People with diabetes, kidney disease or those with cancer or autoimmune disease run the risk of a more severe illness,\" Glatter explained.</p><p>The particular strain of E. coli detected in the current lettuce outbreak -- E. coli O157:H7 -- is particularly nasty, he noted.</p><p>\"Most strains of E. coli do not actually cause diarrhea, but E. coli O157 produces a powerful toxin that injures the inner lining of the small intestine, leading to bloody diarrhea,\" Glatter said. Even a tiny amount of ingested bacteria could spur this type of illness.</p><p>\"It can make people much more ill, and may lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure, in some cases,\" he said.</p><p>Indeed, the CDC has reported one such case already in the latest outbreak.</p><p>In many cases, antibiotics are used to help beat back an E. coli infection, but these drugs can affect the kidneys, Glatter noted.</p><p>\"Antibiotics may be necessary in certain cases, so it's important to see your doctor if you have continued and severe symptoms such as fever, bloody diarrhea, and you are not able to eat or drink,\" he said.</p><p>However, in the case of E. coli O157:H7, \"taking antibiotics may actually increase your risk of developing kidney failure, so it's important to speak with your health care provider if you should develop severe symptoms,\" Glatter advised.</p><p>And if you do think you might be sick with E. coli, or any other foodborne illness, make sure you don't spread it to those near you.</p><p>The bacterium \"can be transmitted person-to-person, so it's vital that anyone who is potentially infected wash their hands thoroughly and not share utensils, cups or glasses,\" Glatter said. \"This also goes for bath towels. Linens also need to be washed in hot water and treated with bleach.\"</p><p>He noted that \"ground beef, unpasteurized milk, fresh produce and contaminated water are common sources of E. coli bacteria.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Find out more about E. coli illness at the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/ecoli-symptoms.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 27, 2018 (HealthDay News) --What if a simple zap to the spine could relieve the debilitating lower back and leg pain brought on by a herniated disk?</p><p>Such is the promise of \"pulse radiofrequency\" therapy (pRF), which sends inflammation-reducing pulses of energy to nerve roots in the spine, a new study claims.</p><p>The therapy is not new, having first received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in the 1980s.</p><p>But recent advances in CT scan technology now enable clinicians to deploy those energy pulses with much more accuracy, experts said. And the new research suggests the treatment could prove a boon to back pain patients for whom standard therapies have failed to do the trick.</p><p>\"I was amazed with the results of pRF,\" said study author Dr. Alessandro Napoli. \"Especially having read, as a radiologist, numerous lumbar MRI scans of patients with recurrent hernia after surgery.\"</p><p>And as a patient himself, Napoli added that \"from personal experience I can tell you that the treatment is not painful, and the results are appreciated within days after a single treatment lasting 10 minutes.\"</p><p>Napoli is a professor of interventional radiology at Sapienza University of Rome in Italy.</p><p>He and his colleagues plan to report their findings Tuesday at the Radiological Society of North America annual meeting, in Chicago. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>Lower disk herniation results when the insulating disks that sit between spinal vertebrae tear open, allowing jelly-like material to protrude and exert pressure on surrounding nerve roots. Beyond lower back pain, the condition often triggers sciatica, a pain that radiates down a patient's leg.</p><p>Standard therapies include over-the-counter pain meds, corticosteroid spinal injections, and/or invasive spine surgery that sometimes involves disk removal and vertebrae fusion.</p><p>The problem, said Napoli, is that such options entail risks without assured relief.</p><p>\"Steroid injections are effective only in portion of the patients, and generally require more sessions,\" he noted. And though surgery safety has \"largely improved,\" Napoli pointed to the risk for bleeding and infection, the need for a minimum two- to three-day hospital stay, the high cost, and the fact that some patients ultimately realize little benefit.</p><p>By contrast, pRF is scalpel-free, delivering radio signals directly to affected nerves via a CT scan-guided electrode. The process, said Napoli, requires no hospital stay, is noninvasive, far cheaper and less risky.</p><p>\"The rationale for using pRF on disk herniation is that we eliminate the inflammation process of the compromised nerve root,\" he explained. \"Without inflammation the pain fades, and the body starts a self-healing process that allows for complete resolution of the disk herniation in a large proportion of patients.\"</p><p>For the study, the Italian investigators compared 128 lumbar herniation patients who underwent a single 10-minute round of CT-guided pRF with 120 patients who received one to three rounds of steroid injections.</p><p>All the patients had already undergone standard interventions, with poor results.</p><p>By the one-year mark following either treatment, a full \"perceived\" recovery was reported by 95 percent of the pRF patients, compared with just 61 percent of the steroid injection patients.</p><p>Dr. Daniel Park, director of minimally invasive orthopedic spine surgery at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich., offered some caution on the findings.</p><p>He noted that because \"the majority of people with back pain improve with time and exercise alone,\" it remains an open question as to whether the pRF procedure really cured the condition.</p><p>Still, Park noted that diagnostic uncertainty can undermine the ability of surgery to get at the true source of a patient's pain, given that \"the problem with low back pain is that there are many causes of it, and physicians have trouble identifying the cause of pain.\"</p><p>Nevertheless, he remains unsure if pRF is truly ready for prime time.</p><p>\"Best case, I think [pRF] could be an option for people if they [have already] failed therapy and medication,\" said Park. \"It may be a similar option for people if they do not or cannot have steroid injections, but they need more treatment. I think this is experimental, and should not be first-line.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons offers more information on <a href=\"https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/herniated-disk-in-the-lower-back\" target=\"_new\">herniated disks</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Dec. 5, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Botox has other uses beyond enhancing lips and minimizing facial wrinkles. Scientists now say it may help prevent atrial fibrillation after heart surgery.  </p><p>A-fib -- an abnormal heart rhythm -- is common after heart surgery, and it's linked to stroke and heart failure. But two new studies suggest that botox injections during surgery temporarily freeze nerve bundles in the heart, preventing the dangerous complication. </p><p>In one study, botox injected into the fat pads near each pulmonary vein reduced odds of atrial fibrillation by 64 percent.</p><p>The effect lasted over three years, long after the botox itself dissipated, said lead researcher Dr. Jonathan Steinberg. </p><p>\"Atrial fibrillation typically lengthens hospital stays and can have complications. Other drugs have been tried, but nothing has come out that is a solid, reliable performer, and there is no standard of care,\" said Steinberg. He is  director of the SMG Arrhythmia Center at the Summit Medical Group in Short Hills, N.J. </p><p>In his study, 60 patients undergoing heart bypass surgery were randomly assigned to either botox or an inactive placebo. All received implantable cardiac monitors that tracked occurrence of atrial fibrillation.</p><p>In the botox group, risk of a-fib dropped immediately after surgery, and fell fivefold to ninefold each year of the three-year follow-up, the researchers found. </p><p>Also during follow-up, significantly fewer botox recipients were hospitalized for a-fib or needed treatment for it compared to the placebo group.</p><p>Botox, or botulinum toxin, blocks signals from the nerves to the muscles. It's a well-known tool in cosmetic surgery, and some doctors use it to treat neurological disorders including migraine, excessive sweating and eye muscle problems.</p><p>In heart surgery, Steinberg said the drug appears to interrupt \"cardiac neural traffic.\"</p><p>He believes the findings suggest a new approach to treatment.</p> <p>In the other study, Dr. Nathan Waldron and colleagues randomly assigned 130 patients to receive an injection of either botox or placebo while undergoing heart bypass surgery.</p><p>\"Injecting botulinum toxin into fat pads surrounding the heart during cardiac surgery may be a promising strategy to reduce atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery, but further study is needed,\" said Waldron, an assistant professor of anesthesiology at Duke University in Durham, N.C. </p><p>The reduction in a-fib risk among the botox group wasn't statistically significant -- only 11 percent -- but the episodes were shorter and less severe, researchers found. This finding may be due to the small size of the study, Waldron's team said.</p><p>Dr. Gregg Fonarow is director of the cardiomyopathy center at the University of California, Los Angeles, and co-director of the UCLA preventative cardiology program.</p><p>Developing effective and safe strategies to lower a-fib risk after surgery has been a challenge, he said.</p><p>\"These new studies, while modest in size, suggest that there is the potential for epicardial fat pad injection of botulinum toxin performed during the cardiac surgery to lower the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation,\" Fonarow said.</p><p>However, additional studies involving larger numbers of patients are needed, he added.</p><p>The reports were recently published online in the journal <i>HeartRhythm</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more about atrial fibrillation, visit the <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/atrial-fibrillation/what-is-atrial-fibrillation-afib-or-af\" target=\"_new\"> American Heart Association</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 6, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Cases of uterine cancer are charting a slow but steady rise among American women, and so are deaths from the disease, new statistics show.</p><p>Looking at federal health data, researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that \"during 1999-2015, uterine cancer incidence rates increased 12 percent, about 0.7 percent per year, on average.\"</p><p>More than two-thirds (68 percent) of cases involved cancers of the endometrium, the lining of the uterus.</p><p>Uterine cancers are often curable if detected early, but late detection often means the tumor has spread and can become fatal. According to the new CDC study, deaths due to uterine cancer have also risen steadily, at an average increase of 1.1 percent per year.</p> <p>That means that between 1999 and 2016, \"uterine cancer death rates increased 21 percent,\" wrote researchers led by S. Jane Henley, of the CDC's Division of Cancer Prevention and Control.</p><p>Why the increases? One expert had a theory.</p><p>\"In general, uterine cancers are the result of excess circulating estrogens that occur when a woman is overweight and has completed the menopause,\" said Dr. Benjamin Schwartz. He directs obstetrics and gynecology at Northwell Health's Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y.</p><p>\"Since the obesity epidemic worsened over the years studied, it is not a surprise then that the incidence of uterine cancers also continued to rise,\" Schwartz said.</p><p>Henley and the CDC team agreed. Overweight or obese women \"are approximately two to four times as likely to develop endometrial cancer as are women with healthy weight,\" they pointed out.</p><p>The new report shows that some groups have been hit harder by uterine cancers than others. Most notably, black women had a much higher increase in cases than the general population -- a 2.4 percent annual rise, adding up to a total 46 percent increase in cases between 1999 and 2016.</p><p>Rates for Hispanic women were also significantly higher than the average, the report found.</p><p>Again, obesity may be a factor, Henley's group said. While 2013-2016 statistics showed that 40 percent of all U.S. women were obese, that number rose to 56 percent among black women and 49 percent among Hispanics, the researchers noted.</p><p>All of this means that \"public health efforts to help women achieve and maintain a healthy weight and obtain sufficient physical activity,\" would help bring uterine cancer numbers down, the CDC team said.</p><p>Earlier detection of these cancers would help save lives, especially for minority women.</p><p>The study found that while 8 percent of uterine tumors among women generally were detected only after they had spread to other tissues, that number doubled to 16 percent among black women.</p><p>That may have led to a near-doubling of fatal uterine cancers among black women. On average, 5 out of every 100,000 U.S. women now die from uterine cancer, the study found, but the rate for black women is 9 out of every 100,000.</p><p>\"The data shows clearly that the earlier the cancer is caught, the easier it is to cure,\" according to Schwartz.</p><p>Certain symptoms can alert women to a potential problem.</p><p>According to the CDC researchers, \"an important early symptom of uterine cancer is abnormal vaginal bleeding, including bleeding between periods or after sex or any unexpected bleeding after menopause.\" This symptom occurs in 9 out of 10 uterine cancer cases, they said.</p><p>Dr. Jennifer Wu is an obstetrician-gynecologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. She agreed that \"patients need to know that they should always discuss abnormal uterine bleeding with their doctors.\"</p><p>And despite the new numbers, Wu stressed that advances in treatment are making uterine cancer much less lethal than before.</p><p>\"Treatments for uterine cancer have improved,\" Wu said. \"Uterine cancers can be treated with minimally invasive surgery such as laparoscopy and robotics, and patients can now have quicker recoveries from these types of surgery.\"</p><p>The new research was published Dec. 7 in the CDC journal <i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/types/uterine\" target=\"_new\">uterine cancers</a>.</p>",

Overall, about 2,000 were overweight or obese, while more than 1,500 were of normal weight.</p><p>Heart failure is a chronic condition in which the heart muscle can no longer pump blood efficiently enough to meet the body's needs. It causes symptoms such as breathlessness, fatigue and fluid buildup.</p><p>In general, the study found, heavier patients tended to show less deterioration in the structure and function of the heart's main pumping chamber.</p><p>And the highest survival rate was seen among overweight or obese patients who were metabolically healthy -- meaning they did not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or abnormal blood sugar levels.</p><p>Among those patients, more than 79 percent were still alive three years later. That compared with 64 percent of normal-weight patients in good metabolic health.</p><p>Patients in the normal-weight group who were metabolically unhealthy fared worst: Only 55 percent were still alive after three years. Metabolically unhealthy obese people fared about the same as normal-weight, metabolically healthy people -- with a survival rate of about 66 percent. </p><p>However, it was apparently not easy to be overweight and metabolically healthy: Only 12 percent of overweight/obese patients were, said researcher Dr. Chan Soon Park.</p><p>Park, of Seoul National University Hospital, was scheduled to present the findings this week at a meeting of the European Society of Cardiology, in Milan, Italy.</p><p>What do the results mean? They do not prove that obesity, itself, provides a survival advantage, said Dr. Gurusher Panjrath.</p><p>Panjrath, who was not involved in the research, chairs the American College of Cardiology's heart failure and transplant section.</p><p>He noted that the study -- like most previous ones -- used body mass index (BMI) to divide patients into weight categories.</p><p>People with a BMI of 23 or higher were considered \"overweight/obese,\" while those with a lower BMI were considered \"normal-weight.\" For example, a 5-foot-8-inch person who weighs 151 pounds has a BMI of 23. (The definitions used for Asian populations are different from those used in the United States and elsewhere, Park said.)</p><p>But BMI -- a measure of weight in relation to height -- is an imprecise gauge, Panjrath explained.</p><p>He said the normal-weight group in this study might have included some patients who were actually more sick and frail. In contrast, people who had more muscle, and may have been relatively fitter, could have fallen into the overweight category.</p><p>In fact, Panjrath said, a number of studies have suggested that cardiovascular fitness levels -- rather than weight -- are critical to heart disease patients' outlook.</p><p>That includes heart failure.</p><p>Often, people develop heart failure after suffering a heart attack that damages the heart muscle, or because of poorly controlled high blood pressure.</p><p>Obesity is a risk factor because it contributes to the conditions that can cause heart failure, Panjrath explained. There's also some evidence those extra pounds might directly affect heart muscle function, he said.</p><p>Once people are diagnosed with heart failure, Panjrath said, the priority is to boost their fitness levels through exercise, and control conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes.</p><p>\"Fitness is more important than fatness,\" Panjrath said. He added, though, that weight loss is encouraged when patients are severely obese.</p><p>Park said that since weight loss can be difficult, efforts to improve factors like blood pressure and fitness may be more practical.</p><p>Research presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart Association has more on <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-failure/treatment-options-for-heart-failure\" target=\"_new\">managing heart failure</a>.</p>",

However, some of the side effects of the operation can be so severe that patients need to be hospitalized, Willis explained in a university news release.</p><p>For the study, the researchers used the 2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database to collect data on nearly 23,000 patients who had thyroid surgery. The procedures were done to cure cancer, treat goiter (an enlarged thyroid), or manage an overactive thyroid.</p><p>In all, 4 percent were hospitalized again within 30 days. Most of these patients were readmitted within a week after surgery. Of the patients that needed readmission, 25 percent returned within two days, the researchers found.</p><p>\"Although 4 percent is less than estimates from earlier, smaller studies, it still amounts to nearly 1,000 patients per year whose symptoms are severe enough to seek immediate medical attention and need admission to the hospital,\" said first author Dr. Arturo Rios-Diaz, a surgical resident at Thomas Jefferson University.</p><p>The researchers found that those at the highest risk of being hospitalized were those with Medicare and Medicaid. Also at risk were patients who had low calcium levels after surgery and those who remained in the hospital two days or more after surgery.</p><p>Low calcium levels, or hypocalcemia, is the most common side effect and is usually caused by damage to or removal of the parathyroid glands. The condition can be treated with calcium pills.</p><p>\"Although the standard treatment for hypocalcemia is simple, patients have to be able to get their medications after discharge from their surgery,\" Willis said.</p><p>\"Patients on Medicaid and Medicare could find it financially or logistically difficult to obtain the treatment before the symptoms begin and worsen,\" he suggested.</p><p>Willis said patients should be checked on by phone in the first days after leaving the hospital, when they have the greatest risk for complications.</p><p>The report was published Jan. 3 in the journal <i>Surgery</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the American Thyroid Association for more on <a href=\"https://www.thyroid.org/thyroid-surgery\" target=\"_new\">thyroid surgery</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 28, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Diabetes, high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol are well-known risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what about just getting sick? Could picking up some type of bug increase your chance of having a stroke or heart attack?</p> <p>A new study suggests it could.</p> <p>Researchers have linked infections such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections to an increased risk of having a coronary event, such as a heart attack or stroke, within the next three months.</p> <p>In the study published recently in the <i>Journal of the American Heart Association</i>, researchers examined a registry of patients tracked over multiple years in four U.S. cities. They looked at 1,312 patients who had a heart attack or other type of coronary event, and 727 other patients who had an ischemic stroke, the kind caused by a blood clot.</p> <p>Of the heart disease patients, about 37 percent had some type of infection within the previous three months. Among stroke patients, it was nearly 30 percent.</p> <p>Infections substantially increased the odds of having a heart attack or stroke compared to a year or two earlier in the same group of patients, and those odds were highest in the first two weeks following the infection.</p> <p>Infections generally trigger an inflammatory reaction in the body, said Dr. Kamakshi Lakshminarayan, a neurologist and senior study author of the research.</p> <p>The body triggers its white cell production to help ward off an infection, but that process also increases the stickiness of cells called platelets, she said. This encourages the formation of clots that could block the flow of blood to the heart or brain.</p> <p>\"The infection appears to be the trigger for changing the finely tuned balance in the blood and making us more prone to thrombosis, or clot formation,\" said Lakshminarayan, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Minnesota's medical school. \"It's a trigger for the blood vessels to get blocked up and puts us at higher risk of serious events like heart attack and stroke.\"</p> <p>The study raises questions about whether patients hospitalized for infections should also begin receiving treatment to protect them from heart disease and stroke. Additional research may provide those answers, Lakshminarayan said.</p> <p>Urinary tract infection, or UTI, was the most common type of infection reported in the study, followed by pneumonia and other respiratory infections. Skin and blood infections also were reported.</p> <p>The study included patients treated for infections while hospitalized and those who received outpatient care. Both groups were more likely to have a cardiovascular event within three months of the infection, but this association appeared to be stronger among the inpatient group.</p> <p>That's because infections requiring hospitalizations are probably more severe to begin with, said Juan Badimon, a professor of medicine and director of the atherothrombosis research unit at Mount Sinai School of Medicine's Cardiovascular Institute in New York.</p> <p>\"And if the infection is that severe, we can assume a stronger inflammatory response will result in a higher cardiovascular risk,\" said Badimon, who was not involved in the research but co-authored an editorial that accompanied the study.</p> <p>He described the study's association between cardiovascular events and all types of infections, not just respiratory ones, a \"novel discovery.\" But, he said, he would like to have seen researchers dig deeper and note whether the infection source -- viral or bacterial -- played a role in the increased risk for heart attacks and strokes.</p> <p>Badimon hopes the findings will encourage the public to make sure their vaccinations are up-to-date, especially during flu season.</p> <p>Lakshminarayan agreed.</p> <p>\"One of the biggest takeaways is that we have to prevent these infections whenever possible,\" she said, \"and that means flu shots and pneumonia vaccines, especially for older individuals.\"</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 28, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Fast tests designed to help primary care doctors rapidly spot dementia in their elderly patients often get it wrong, a new British report contends.</p><p>The finding concerns three widely used quick dementia tests: the \"Mini-Mental State Examination\" (intended to assess mental orientation and verbal memory); the \"Memory Impairment Screen\" (which tests verbal memory); and \"Animal Naming\" (which gives patients one minute to quickly name as many animals as they can).</p><p>The result: more than one-third of the patients were misclassified -- as either having or not having dementia -- by at least one of the rapid tests in question.</p><p>\"Dementia can be difficult to accurately detect, particularly in a primary care setting,\" said study lead author Janice Ranson. But the rapid tests \"are important screening tools to help clinicians decide who is likely to benefit from further testing for dementia,\" she acknowledged.</p><p>\"Our results suggest that some of the misclassification is due to test biases, such as a patient's age, ethnicity or education level,\" she added.</p><p>Ranson is a doctoral researcher in clinical epidemiology at the University of Exeter Medical School in England.</p><p>She and her colleagues reported their findings in the Nov. 28 online issue of the journal <i>Neurology: Clinical Practice</i>.</p><p>Ranson said quick tests are \"routinely used\" by primary care doctors as an initial screening. And if signs of dementia are found, a \"full dementia investigation\" typically ensues.</p><p>The study included just over 800 patients in the United States who underwent the tests. The participants ranged in age from 70 to 110, with an average age of 82. </p><p>The patients initially underwent comprehensive three- to four-hour dementia assessments. These involved a neurological exam, blood pressure readings, a medication review, DNA sampling, depression screening and lifestyle/family history interviews.</p><p>These comprehensive assessments revealed that about one-third of the patients had dementia.</p><p>All of the participants subsequently underwent each of the three quick dementia tests.</p><p>But when the research team compared the quick test results with the in-depth results, they found that 36 percent of the patients were mistakenly diagnosed by at least one of the quick tests.</p><p>Interestingly, the researchers found that individually, each quick test actually had a misdiagnosis rate of 14 to 21 percent, and only 2 percent of the patients were misdiagnosed by all three tests.</p><p>Why? Each test appeared to have a different problematic bias, the study authors said. For example, while one test appeared to underdiagnose dementia in highly educated patients, others appeared to miss the mark based on patient age, race or nursing home status.</p><p>\"Each test is biased in different ways,\" said Ranson, \"and so some tests are more accurate than others for certain patient groups. While these results are at first concerning, knowing the specific limitations for each test will help clinicians decide which is the most appropriate for their patient.\"</p><p>Still, she said there's definitely room for improvement.</p><p>\"We desperately need more accurate and less biased ways of detecting dementia swiftly in clinic,\" said Ranson. \"We are therefore developing new technology, using data science and artificial intelligence, to help clinicians get the best outcome for their patients. We are working hard to improve these tests with a more personalized approach to cognitive testing.\"</p><p>Keith Fargo is director of scientific programs and outreach with the Alzheimer's Association, in Chicago. \"Diagnosing Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia is an incredibly complex process, and not something that can be done on the quick,\" he said.</p><p>\"Simple cognitive tests can be a helpful first step toward diagnosis, but as the study points out, are imperfect,\" Fargo explained.</p><p>\"The Alzheimer's Association supports efforts to better understand and account for potential biases in short assessments for cognitive impairment,\" Fargo added. \"Ensuring a timely and accurate diagnosis is critical, and this study identifies important biases that need to be considered when using these preliminary assessments.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>To learn more about dementia and dementia diagnosis, visit the <a href=\"https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia/\" target=\"_new\">Alzheimer's Association</a>.</p>",

As you age, telomeres shorten and result in cell aging. However, an enzyme called telomerase can counteract the shortening process and even add length to the telomeres.</p><p>The study participants were randomly assigned to six months of either: endurance training (long sessions of running);  high-intensity interval training (high-intensity running alternating with slower running); resistance (weight) training; or no changes in activity (the control group).</p><p>The participants' telomere length and telomerase activity were assessed at the start of the study, and two to seven days after the final exercise session, according to the authors. The study was published Nov. 27 in the <i>European Heart Journal</i>.</p><p>\"Our main finding is that compared to the start of the study and the control group, in volunteers who did endurance and high-intensity training, telomerase activity and telomere length increased, which are both important for cellular aging, regenerative capacity and thus, healthy aging,\" said study leader Ulrich Laufs, a professor at Leipzig University in Germany. \"Interestingly, resistance training did not exert these effects.\"</p><p>Compared to the resistance and control groups, telomerase activity increased two- to threefold and telomere length increased significantly in the endurance and high-intensity training groups.</p><p>\"The study identifies a mechanism by which endurance training -- but not resistance training -- improves healthy aging. It may help to design future studies on this important topic by using telomere length as indicator of 'biological age' in future intervention studies,\" Laufs said in a journal news release.</p><p>Endurance and high-intensity training could increase telomere length and telomerase activity by affecting levels of nitric oxide in blood vessels, which produces changes in cells, the researchers theorized.</p><p>\"From an evolutionary perspective, endurance and high-intensity training may mimic the advantageous traveling and fight-or-flight behavior of our ancestors better than strength training,\" said study co-author Dr. Christian Werner, from Saarland University in Germany.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute offers a guide to <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/phy_act.htm\" target=\"_new\">physical activity</a>.</p>",

That's a band of nerve fibers that connects and helps \"integrate\" functions between the two halves of the brain.</p><p>The football players' brain scans were also compared to those taken of a \"control\" group of 22 boys who didn't play football.</p><p>Clear differences were seen, according to the researchers who presented the findings Thursday at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), in Chicago.</p><p>\"The years from age 9 to 12 are very important when it comes to brain development,\" said lead study author Jeongchul Kim, of Wake Forest School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C.</p><p> \"The functional regions of the brain are starting to integrate with one another, and players exposed to repetitive brain injuries, even if the amount of impact is small, could be at risk,\" he explained in an RSNA news release. </p><p>\"The body of the corpus callosum is a unique structure that's somewhat like a bridge connecting the left and right hemispheres of the brain,\" Kim said. \"When it's subjected to external forces, some areas will contract and others will expand, just like when a bridge is twisting in the wind.\"</p><p>So, the new study suggests that repeated hits to the head -- as can occur in the rough-and-tumble of football -- may be causing the brain changes seen in these young players.</p><p>Still, the study is not conclusive, and further research is needed to confirm that repeated blows to the head in football and other youth contact sports could lead to changes in the shape of the corpus callosum during this critical time of brain development, Kim said.</p><p>Similar findings were reported on Monday in another study from the RSNA meeting.  In that study, researchers at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas compared pre- and post-season MRI scans from 60 football-playing boys aged 9 to 18.</p><p>Those researchers saw more gray matter volume in the brains of youngsters who had high-impact hits -- but no concussions -- over the season.</p><p>More gray matter brain tissue indicates that the brain might not be working as well as it could be, explained study author Gowtham Krishnan Murugesan.</p><p>One expert who's seen the effects of brain trauma first hand agreed that young people may not need a full-blown concussion to be neurologically changed by head impacts.</p><p>While the sample size in the Wake Forest study is small, \"it demonstrates that structural changes in the brain do in fact develop in children who experience repetitive subconcussive impacts, without immediate symptoms of concussion such as dizziness, headaches or nausea,\" said Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>\"It's vital that parents be aware of the unknown long-term neurological risks after subconcussive hits to the head involved in children playing contact sports,\" he said.</p><p>Glatter also pointed to other research, which has suggested that some kids may be more vulnerable to these brain changes than others, based on their individual genetics.</p><p>Pinpointing these more vulnerable kids \"will be vital in selecting which children are at greater risk when playing contact sports,\" Glatter believes.</p><p>In any case, children are not just \"small adults\" when it comes to head impacts and their effect on the brain, he said.</p><p>\"Because children are growing and developing, they are more susceptible to undergo changes in key structural areas, such as the corpus callosum, which is important in thinking, reasoning, and motor functions between the right and left sides of the brain,\" Glatter explained.</p><p>Research presented at medical meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/headsup/youthsports/index.html\" target=\"_new\">concussion in youth sports</a>.</p>",

She's one of the lead coordinators for the report.</p><p>Babies now can expect to live 78.6 years on average, based on 2017 data, according to NCHS researchers.</p><p>That's down from 78.7 years in 2015 and 78.9 years in 2014.</p><p>There were a total of 2.8 million U.S. deaths in 2017, almost 70,000 more than the previous year,the CDC reported.</p><p>\"We've been talking about the fact that our children will live less long than we will, and that's clearly coming to pass,\" said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.</p><p>Worse, it looks like the trend will continue for at least another year, said Benjamin, who wasn't involved with the research.</p><p>\"I always tell people one year is interesting, two years is more interesting, and three years is a trend,\" Benjamin said.</p><p>Final longevity numbers for 2014 through 2016 were published Sept. 20 in <i>Health, United States, 2017</i>, an annual report produced by the NCHS. The new numbers take that through 2017.</p><p>Life expectancy at birth decreased by 0.2 years between 2014 and 2015, which was the first drop seen since 1993. It then decreased another 0.1 years between 2015 and 2016.</p><p>The opioid epidemic likely plays a large role in the continuing decline, the researchers said, with a record 70,000 deaths linked to drug overdoses in 2017 alone.</p><p>The age-adjusted death rate for drug overdose in the United States increased 72 percent between 2006 and 2016, to stand at 19.8 by 2016. It then rose by another 9.6 percent in 2017, and now stands at nearly 22 deaths per 100,000. </p><p>There's also been a startling increase in the suicide rate. Between 2006 and 2017, the age-adjusted suicide death rate increased 23 percent, from 11 to 14 deaths per 100,000 people.</p><p>Suicides have been increasing in particular among military veterans and children, Benjamin said.</p><p>\"We don't understand all of the root causes of that, but we certainly are in a much more stressful society,\" Benjamin said. \"We have a huge population of people coming back from military service and [they] aren't necessarily getting the services they need to deal with mental health issues and traumatic brain injury.\"</p><p>Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis also appears to play a part in the decline in life expectancy.</p><p>Death rates for chronic liver disease increased by an average 7.9 percent per year between 2006 and 2016 among men aged 25 to 34, the report found. Among women in the same age group, this increase averaged 11.4 percent per year.</p><p>This could have been caused by a number of factors, including alcohol use or hepatitis infection, Gindi said.</p><p>The report also noted increases in the rates of death caused by Alzheimer's disease and septicemia, or blood poisoning.</p><p>For decades, life expectancy increased based on public health measures people now take for granted, Gindi said -- modern sewers, clean water, vaccines.</p><p>More recently, a focus on caring for chronic diseases kept life expectancy growing.</p><p>\"When we acknowledged that chronic diseases played a larger role, we were able to start preventing and diagnosing and treating these in ways we hadn't been able to before, particularly heart disease and cancer,\" Gindi said.</p><p>But gains in life expectancy due to advances against heart disease and cancer have been flattening, Benjamin said, while these other causes of death have been increasing.</p><p>\"People were predicting this would be because of the obesity epidemic,\" Benjamin said of the downward trend in life expectancy. \"Not to say that doesn't play a role, but suicides and drug overdoses have eclipsed that in many ways and it's really a driving factor.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/life-expectancy.htm\" target=\"_new\">life expectancy</a> in the United States.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 30, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- There's a good chance that some cases of the mysterious polio-like illness seen recently in U.S. children may have been misdiagnosed, a new study reports.</p><p>Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), which causes potentially life-threatening paralysis and primarily strikes children, has been recurring in the United States in every-other-year waves since 2014.</p><p>But it's likely some kids diagnosed with AFM actually have some other neurological disorder. And it's an equally good possibility that some true cases of AFM are being missed, said Dr. Matthew Elrick, a pediatric neurologist with Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.</p><p>\"This is a challenging diagnosis,\" said study lead researcher Elrick. \"There is overlap with other diseases.\"</p><p>His team reviewed 45 children who met the broad federal definition of AFM, and found that 11 were actually suffering from other neurological illnesses.</p><p>Elrick and his colleagues believe they've identified specific symptoms that more clearly indicate AFM, based on the group of kids they studied.</p><p>It's important to come up with a more precise definition because AFM is \"a major public health concern that we really need to focus on,\" Elrick said.</p><p>So far in 2018, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 116 cases of AFM out of a total 286 reports under investigation. These cases have occurred in 31 U.S. states.</p><p>This is the third wave of AFM to strike the United States, and it's expected to be the largest on record.</p><p>AFM first appeared in 2014, when 120 children across 34 states were stricken with mysterious muscle weakness.</p><p>Another wave hit in 2016, with 149 patients affected in 39 states.</p><p>\"During the first outbreak in 2014, it was sort of a curiosity we hoped was a one-time thing, but it's now established a pattern, coming back in 2016 and 2018 with higher numbers each time,\" Elrick said. \"There's plenty of reason to be concerned that there could be another outbreak in 2020 and beyond.\"</p><p>The new study, published Nov. 30 in the journal <i>JAMA Pediatrics</i>, found that children with definite AFM share several characteristics:</p><ul><li>All of the kids with more restrictively defined AFM had a viral infection that preceded their weakness.</li><li>These children all shared similar readings on MRI scans, spinal fluid tests and electromyography (a test of the electrical activity of muscle tissue).</li><li>All of the kids had a pattern of muscle weakness indicating damage to the lower motor neurons, which are nerve cells in the spinal cord that initiate muscle contraction.</li></ul><p>\"They were not only weak but also their muscle tone was decreased and their reflexes were decreased or absent,\" Elrick said.</p><p>A couple of other symptoms could indicate AFM but are not conclusive, the researchers added.</p><p>Nearly every case of AFM starts out asymmetrically, with one side of the body more affected than the other, Elrick said. But this can't be used to rule out AFM in a child with symmetric muscle weakness.</p><p>Timing also could be important. \"The symptoms come on relatively suddenly but then gradually progress over the course of hours to days, where some of the other cases have this really rapid onset,\" Elrick said.</p><p>On the other hand, there are some symptoms that should prompt doctors to consider diagnoses other than AFM, the researchers said.</p><p>For example, kids with AFM do not typically lose feeling or sensation alongside their paralysis. They tend to be awake and alert, and MRI scans do not show any signs of lesions or damage to the brain, Elrick said.</p><p>\"I wouldn't necessarily say that a child who does not meet these criteria in the hospital absolutely does not have AFM, but it would at least make me pause and go back and reconsider alternative diagnoses,\" Elrick said.</p><p>The CDC set a broad case definition for AFM, so the agency's epidemiologists could gather as many potential cases as possible for evaluation, Elrick said. Out of those, a smaller number will be confirmed.</p><p>But when it comes to finding a treatment or cure for AFM, researchers will need to be much more precise when they select patients to study, Elrick said. That way, they will know they are working with someone who has the actual disease.</p><p>\"This is a step forward for how you define these patients in a research setting, but also provides some guidance in a clinical setting,\" Elrick said.</p><p>It is indeed very possible that some AFM cases are being misdiagnosed, said Dr. Riley Bove, a neurologist with the University of California, San Francisco.</p><p>\"I know sometimes presentations in children can overlap. Several different types of conditions can cause injury to the spinal cord,\" said Bove, who wrote a perspective piece that accompanied Elrick's study.</p><p>Bove's son, 8-year-old Luca, developed AFM during the first wave in 2014, and he shares the characteristics identified by Elrick's research team.</p><p>The boy fell ill with a virus that went through his home and his school, and recovered from it, Bove said.</p><p>\"About 10 days later he woke up and his head fell back, and he said he was dizzy and couldn't sit up straight,\" Bove said. \"Over the course of the day, his neck and right arm paralyzed.\"</p><p>He further worsened over the next week, losing all muscle function from his face down. At one point, Luca's paralysis became so dire he needed assistance with breathing and feeding, Bove said.</p><p>The boy walked out of rehab \"very floppy and weak\" two months later, Bove said.</p><p>\"He still has patchy weakness in most parts of his body, especially his right arm and neck and shoulder,\" Bove said. \"He's had to learn how to write left-handed. He has that classic floppy, skinny, short little limb with polio.\"</p><p>Still, worried parents should keep in mind that this is \"really, really rare,\" Bove said.</p><p>But since it's a rare condition, parents should be prepared to push their doctors hard if their child develops muscle weakness following a viral infection, she added.</p><p>\"Parents really have to be advocates here, because the condition is rare and there's poor awareness of it,\" Bove said. \"If a parent does notice unusual symptoms in their kid, be really persistent about having those evaluated.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about <a href=\" https://www.cdc.gov/acute-flaccid-myelitis/index.html\" target=\"_new\">acute flaccid myelitis</a>.</p>",

Scientists found that hairless skin secretes a protein that blocks a signaling pathway (WNT) that controls hair growth.</p><p>Called Dickkopf 2 (DKK2), the protein is found in specific embryonic and adult tissues and has a variety of functions, the University of Pennsylvania researchers explained.</p><p>They found that plantar skin from mice -- similar to the underside of the human wrist -- had high levels of DKK2. When they genetically removed DKK2 from the mice, hair began to grow in this normally hairless skin region.</p><p>\"This is significant because it tells us WNT is still present in hairless regions, it's just being blocked,\" said study co-senior author Sarah Millar, director of the Penn Skin Biology and Diseases Resource-Based Center.</p><p>\"We know that WNT signaling is critical for the development of hair follicles; blocking it causes hairless skin, and switching it on causes formation of more hair,\" Millar said in a Penn news release.</p><p>\"In this study, we've shown the skin in hairless regions naturally produces an inhibitor that stops WNT from doing its job,\" she added.</p><p>Hair follicles develop before birth. This means that hair follicles don't regrow after severe burns or deep wounds. The researchers are currently investigating whether secreted WNT inhibitors suppress hair follicle development in such cases.</p><p>More than 80 million people in the United States have male- or female-pattern baldness, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. Previous research suggests that DKK2 may be associated with this condition, meaning it could be a potential target for treatment.</p><p>\"We hope that these lines of investigation will reveal new ways to improve wound healing and hair growth, and we plan to continue to pursue these goals moving forward,\" Millar said.</p><p>The study was published Nov. 28 in the journal <i>Cell Reports</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Dermatology has more on <a href=\"https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/hair-and-scalp-problems/hair-loss\" target=\"_new\">hair loss</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>SATURDAY, Dec. 1, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Teens and adults with epilepsy are at increased risk for depression and should undergo regular screening, two new studies say.</p><p>In one study, researchers evaluated nearly 400 teens, ages 15 to 18, with epilepsy. They found that 8 percent had moderate or severe depression and another 5 percent had attempted suicide or thought about it.</p><p>An additional 22 percent of teens scored high enough to suggest a risk for depressive symptoms, the researchers said.</p><p>The rate of depression in the general population is less than 8 percent, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Abnormal brain activity in people with epilepsy causes seizures or periods of unusual sensations.</p><p>\"We know that depression is more common in people with epilepsy compared to the general population, but there is less information about depression in children and teens than adults,\" said lead author Hillary Thomas, a psychologist at Children's Health System in Dallas.</p><p>Also, little is known about the factors that increase the likelihood of depressive symptoms, Thomas said in a news release from the American Epilepsy Society.</p><p>\"Depression screening should be routine at epilepsy treatment centers and can identify children and teens who would benefit from intervention,\" she added.</p><p>Study senior author Dr. Susan Arnold is director of the Pediatric Epilepsy Center at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. She said the findings hint at a larger problem.</p><p>\"Our results don't mean that only 13 percent of the teens with epilepsy had depressive symptoms,\" Arnold said.</p><p>\"They indicate the significant percentage of teens whose level of depressive symptoms warranted behavioral health referrals or further evaluation or even intervention during a clinic visit,\" Arnold explained. \"Health care providers need to be vigilant about continually screening children and teens for depression.\" </p><p>The other study involved 120 adults with epilepsy. Researchers found that 52 percent who'd experienced a health crisis, such as an emergency room visit or accident, had moderate or severe depression.</p><p>That study also found that adult epilepsy patients with depression may have other mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder or panic disorder. They too should be screened, the researchers said.</p><p>\"People with epilepsy who have depression are more likely to have seizures, so treating the depression doesn't just help with depression, but also with the epilepsy,\" said Dr. Martha Sajatovic, lead author of the adult study. She's director of neurological outcomes at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland.</p><p>\"Identifying people with epilepsy who have depression or other mental health issues is half of the battle,\" Sajatovic said. \"Following up to ensure they receive treatment is vital, because it can truly change patient outcomes and help them achieve their best quality of life.\"</p><p>For example, the researchers found that severely depressed epilepsy patients are less likely to work.</p><p>Those who are identified with mental health issues should get treatment such as cognitive behavioral therapy and medication, said Sajatovic. </p><p>The studies were scheduled for presentation Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Epilepsy Society, in New Orleans. Research presented at meetings is usually considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians has more on <a href=\"https://familydoctor.org/condition/epilepsy/?adfree=true\" target=\"_new\">epilepsy</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Dec. 7, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Jasmine Johnson has become reacquainted with the South Dallas neighborhood where she grew up. Much is familiar, but she's noticed there aren't many places that sell fresh food.</p> <p>The 29-year-old filmmaker is determined to bring attention to the issue for a community riddled with diabetes, high blood pressure and other chronic diseases. She said the short film she's making about the impact poor nutrition has on the health of people in that area is her way of giving back to the black community where her family's roots and civic contributions run deep.</p> <p>\"There are people that are struggling. There are people that are hurting,\" said Johnson. \"There are people that need more attention than they are getting.\"</p> <p>Johnson said she knew her friend Carlita Wilson was the right person to team up with for the project. The women's proposal won first place in a competition sponsored this summer by the American Heart Association's EmPowered to Serve initiative, a program that promotes heart disease and stroke awareness in black communities. The film doesn't have a release date yet. </p> <p>Wilson grew up in Chicago's South Side, a largely black community and an area that is known for crime problems and poverty. The freelance script writer from Arlington, Texas, said her childhood neighborhood and South Dallas share many bad nutritional traits.</p> <p>\"There was always fried chicken, fried fish options on every corner,\" said Wilson, 37. \"There were plenty of liquor stores, plenty of places that you can buy things that we didn't necessarily need or weren't healthy. There weren't fresh food options hardly anywhere.\"</p> <p>Black adults are more likely than white adults to suffer from high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity and other conditions that cause or increase the risk for heart disease and stroke. They're also more likely to die from heart disease and stroke compared to other racial and ethnic groups.</p> <p>Both women know firsthand that poor eating habits can take a serious toll on health.</p> <p>Johnson's mother has had three strokes over the past eight years. She also has uncontrolled high blood pressure. Johnson attributes her mother's health problems to many years of pizzas, chicken nuggets, hamburgers and other fast food. </p> <p>Her father has diabetes, and last year, Johnson's doctor told her she was prediabetic. Johnson said she so rarely ate fruits and vegetables growing up that she considered them a treat.</p> <p>Wilson's parents have similar struggles with diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease. Although the family regularly ate home-cooked meals, their diet was short on fruits and healthier vegetables. </p> <p>Their loved ones' health scares -- and their own -- made the pair determined to take better care of themselves and their families. </p> <p>Johnson said she's cooking more and has inspired her family to eat healthier meals, and cooks regularly for her parents. She's gotten some of her cousins to try her kale shakes. </p> <p>\"If there's a will, there's a way,\" said Johnson. \"Not on my watch will they die because of the poor nutrition.\"</p> <p>Wilson, who has a 12-year-old son, said she's learned to put a healthy twist on the soul food meals of her childhood she now cooks for her family. Getting her boyfriend and his son to eat more fruits and vegetables is an ongoing project, she said.</p> <p>The women hope the film resonates beyond Dallas in other black communities where many people don't eat right in part because they're struggling to make ends meet. They want their project to inspire people in those cities and towns to take charge of their nutrition to get healthy.</p> <p>\"You can be proactive. You don't have to get heart disease, you don't have to become diabetic,\" Wilson said. \"I do believe change can happen.\"</p>",

Finding these mutations early may lead to helping newborns live better lives and ease the worries of their families. </p><p>For the study, Green and his colleagues randomly assigned 128 healthy newborns and 31 ill infants to have their DNA sequenced.</p><p>Among all the babies, 9.4 percent had a gene mutation that increased the risk of a disorder that arises or is manageable during childhood, or a mutation that conferred a moderate risk for a condition for which treatment during childhood might prevent devastating outcomes later in life.</p><p>Mutations included those linked to several heart conditions that affect how the heart functions, according to the report. These conditions can be monitored, and families have been referred to cardiac specialists.</p><p>One newborn had a risk for biotin deficiency, which can lead to skin rash, hair loss and seizures. That child's diet is now being supplemented with biotin, which should prevent any symptoms, the researchers said.</p><p> Senior study author Alan Beggs explained that \"sequencing results have potential to raise questions that may be upsetting for parents, but could also lead to helpful or even lifesaving interventions.\" Beggs is director of The Manton Center of Orphan Disease Research at Boston Children's Hospital. </p><p>\"Only time will tell how the costs -- both financial and in terms of extra medical testing and family stress -- balance out against the benefits. That's what we're really trying to find out,\" he said. </p><p>The researchers also offered parents information about their child's risk for adult-onset conditions. Three of 85 infants whose parents agreed to receive this information had these types of gene mutations. These variants were also found in the mothers of the three children.</p><p> Green said, \"Disclosing genetic risk for adult-onset conditions in children has been discouraged in traditional genetics in order to protect the child's 'right not to know,' but our results demonstrate that many parents want access to this information about their child.\" </p><p>He added that the \"findings suggest that thoroughly sequencing newborns reveals potentially lifesaving information in both infants and their parents far more commonly than was previously thought, and should encourage our entire field to re-evaluate the value of comprehensively analyzing and disclosing genomic information at any age.\"</p><p>The report was published Jan. 3 in the <i>American Journal of Human Genetics</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on genetic sequencing, visit the <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/10001177/dna-sequencing-fact-sheet/\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institutes of Health</a>.</p>",

Many studies over the past 15 years have found a greater risk of birth defects in babies whose mothers drank well water with concentrations of certain contaminants.</p><p>You can't rely on how your water looks coming out of the faucet to evaluate its safety. That's because dangerous contaminants don't always affect color or smell. One example is nitrate, a chemical found in many fertilizers that can leech into the water table. It's long been linked to birth defects like limb deformities and cleft palates.</p><p>A 2016 study done at the Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center School of Public Health and published in the journal <i>Current Environmental Health Reports</i> linked two other common substances to birth defects: atrazine and arsenic. Atrazine is an herbicide that can get into soil and groundwater. Arsenic most often leeches into water naturally, from bedrock, but that doesn't make it less dangerous.</p><p>Various types of birth defects have been seen when two or more of these contaminants are present at the same time.</p><p>If a private well is your primary source of drinking water, ask your local health department how to find a water testing facility near you, or call the EPA Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 1-800-426-4791.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has detailed information on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/private/wells/testing.html\" target=\"_new\">well testing</a>, along with other topics concerning private wells.</p>",

That's because the nail bed does not contain melanin, which gives skin its color.</p><p>The app should enable patients with chronic anemia to monitor themselves to know when they need to adjust their therapies or receive transfusions. This could reduce side effects or complications of having transfusions too early or too late, Lam's team said.</p><p>Mannino's experience proved integral to the research.</p><p>\"This whole project couldn't have been done by anyone but Rob,\" Lam said. \"He took pictures of himself before and after transfusions as his hemoglobin levels were changing, which enabled him to constantly refine and tweak his technology on himself in a very efficient manner. So essentially, he was his own perfect initial test subject with each iteration of the app.\"</p><p>One doctor who often treats anemia in children was optimistic about the new technology, with one caveat.</p><p>Dr. Michael Grosso directs pediatrics at Huntington Hospital in Huntington, N.Y. He agreed that \"the availability of a rapid, accurate and non-invasive anemia screening test could have significant benefits.\"</p><p>But he was concerned that the app might miss more subtle forms of anemia.</p><p>\"It turns out that mild iron deficiency can affect the body without triggering anemia, and children in that situation would be missed by the non-invasive test,\" Grosso said. \"So, the smartphone test definitely falls short of the tried-and-true blood count, but it is better than no test at all.\"</p><p>For their part, Lam and colleagues said further research, conducted with a variety of patient types, is ongoing. That means the app's sensitivity and accuracy should improve with time.</p><p>\"This is just a snapshot of the accuracy right now,\" Lam said. \"The algorithm gets smarter with every patient enrolled.\"</p><p>The research was funded in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Lam and Mannino have filed a patent application for the anemia app, and will have financial interest in its success.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has more on <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/anemia\" target=\"_new\">anemia</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Dec. 5, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- For certain women with early stage breast cancer, a newer drug that combines an antibody with chemotherapy may cut the risk of disease recurrence in half, a new trial finds.</p><p>The study focused on nearly 1,500 women with early stage breast cancer that was HER2-positive -- meaning it carries a protein that promotes cancer growth.</p><p>About one in every five breast cancers is HER2-positive.</p><p>All of the women in the new trial had undergone a standard treatment scenario. First, they received traditional chemotherapy and the drug Herceptin (trastuzumab) -- an antibody that targets HER2-positive cancer cells. Then they had surgery to remove any remaining cancer.</p><p>Often, women find out that the chemo-Herceptin therapy has already wiped out the cancer, explained Dr. Charles Geyer, the lead researcher on the new study.</p><p>But for many other women, there is still \"residual\" cancer at the time of surgery. And they have a relatively higher risk of seeing their cancer come back, said Geyer, a professor of medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond.</p><p>All of the women in his study fell into that category.</p><p>Right now, the standard of care is to keep those patients on Herceptin for another year after surgery. Geyer's team wanted to know if women might fare better on a different drug, Kadcyla.</p><p>Kadcyla is a newer drug that combines Herceptin with a chemotherapy drug called emtansine. In the United States, it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating some women with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer.</p><p>Geyer explained the basics of how the drug works: \"The chemotherapy is attached to the antibody. The idea is that the antibody will carry the chemo directly into the cells that you want to hit.\"</p><p>Geyer and his colleagues reasoned that Kadcyla might be more effective than Herceptin at preventing recurrences in their early stage patients.</p><p>\"It turned out that hypothesis was correct,\" he said.</p><p>Of women who received the drug for a year after surgery, 88 percent were alive and cancer-free three years later. That compared with 77 percent of those given Herceptin.</p><p>\"That difference is quite substantial,\" said Dr. Eric Winer, a medical oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.</p><p>Winer, who was not involved in the research, said the findings will probably \"change practice in the short term.\"</p><p>Kadcyla is not yet approved to treat patients like those in this trial. But doctors are free to use FDA-approved drugs for reasons other than their official indication -- though insurers have to agree to pay.</p><p>Winer said that with this new evidence, \"it's likely\" insurers will pay for Kadcyla in cases like these.</p><p>When it was approved in 2013, the drug's cost was more than $90,000 for a typical course of treatment -- about double the price of Herceptin.</p><p>Geyer was scheduled to present the findings Wednesday at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. The study was published simultaneously online in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>. </p><p>The research was funded by Kadcyla maker F. Hoffmann La Roche/Genentech. Geyer is an unpaid member of the company's breast cancer advisory boards.</p> <p>The study involved 1,486 women with early stage cancer who still had tumor tissue left after standard chemotherapy and Herceptin. Following surgery, they were randomly assigned to receive either Kadcyla or Herceptin for about a year. Both drugs are given by infusion, every three weeks.</p><p>The women were followed for three years after their treatment. At that point, about 12 percent of Kadcyla patients had suffered a recurrence or died, versus 22 percent of Herceptin patients.</p><p>However, there were more side effects with Kadcyla, Geyer said. They included a drop in blood platelets -- cells that help the blood clot -- plus nerve symptoms such as numbness, and elevations in liver enzymes.</p><p>But the majority, according to Geyer, were at the milder \"grade 1 or 2\" level.</p><p>Winer framed the findings within a bigger picture: Over the past two decades, treatment advances -- including Herceptin and similar drugs -- have allowed more and more women with HER2-positive breast cancer to fare well.</p><p>\"This study is another step in the direction of preventing more recurrences,\" he said. \"It's exciting.\"</p><p>Geyer agreed. \"Women with HER2-positive cancer generally have a very favorable outlook,\" he said. \"The group having recurrences is getting smaller and smaller.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Cancer Society has more on <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/understanding-a-breast-cancer-diagnosis/breast-cancer-her2-status.html\" target=\"_new\">HER2-positive breast cancer</a>.</p>",

Whether you're trying to drop pounds or stay at a healthy weight, some adjustments will let you  keep it on the menu.</p><p>Rice belongs to the grain family. While grains are an important part of your overall diet, standard white rice isn't a nutritious choice -- it's not a whole grain. What's more, it's a food that has 200 calories per cup, so you want to make sure that you maximize nutrients as well as flavor.</p><p>First, opt for brown rice, the whole-grain form, as often as possible. White rice has gone through a process that removes its fiber and many of its nutrients, including protein, iron and some B vitamins.</p><p>There are many types -- and colors -- of whole grain rice to sample, including brown basmati, red rice, purple Thai and Chinese black rice.  Popular Wehani rice is a whole grain, reddish-brown American hybrid of basmati and brown rices. Note that wild rice is another tasty choice, though technically it's not a rice, but rather a semi-aquatic grass. It makes a great medley when mixed with brown rice.</p><p>Also experiment with different ways to turn rice into a meal rather than a side dish. For lunch or a cold supper, load a whole-wheat pita pocket with cooked and cooled rice and chopped vegetables and top with a light vinaigrette.</p><p>Or try a cold rice salad for a to-go meal. For your protein, add in chunks of turkey, chicken, tofu or nuts, then blend in a handful of dried raisins or cranberries and a sprinkling of seasonings.</p> <p>You can even get creative and make homemade sushi rolls at home. Use avocado and cucumber if you're not a fan of raw fish.</p><p>Baked with milk, eggs, vanilla, a small amount of sweetener and cinnamon, brown rice can even make a healthy version of rice pudding for dessert or even breakfast.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Whole Grains Council has more on all types of <a href=\"https://wholegrainscouncil.org/whole-grains-101/easy-ways-enjoy-whole-grains/grain-month-calendar/wild-rice-september-grain-month-0\" target=\"_new\">rice</a> to help you enjoy the healthiest varieties.</p>",

A Western Colorado University study sponsored by the American Council on Exercise (ACE) tested the variables and found definitive results.</p><p>First, on days when you're doing cardio, you should typically start with this workout, whatever aerobic activity you choose. You'll not only get the maximum benefits by doing it first, but you'll also warm up your body for the second exercise.</p><p>If strength training is also part of that day's plan, do it next. If you're piggy-backing all types of exercise, flexibility and motor skills should follow strength training, in whatever order you like.</p><p>The research found that this sequence had psychological as well as physical benefits.</p><p>However, experts add that it's fine to personalize these findings based on individual goals. For instance, if you need to focus on one type of exercise in particular, like flexibility to help with low back pain, start a multi-discipline session with that workout so that you're fresh when doing it. Or if building muscle is your top goal, start with strength training.</p><p>Another approach is to devote certain days of the week to your primary area of focus, and then double or triple up on the other fitness disciplines on different days.

Toxic levels of the vitamin can lead to kidney failure and death.</p><p>If your dog has eaten any of the recalled brands and show these symptoms, you should contact your veterinarian immediately, the FDA said.</p><p>The recalled brands include Nutrisca; Natural Life Pet Products; Sunshine Mills, Inc.; ANF, Inc.; Lidl (Orlando brand); Kroger; ELM Pet Foods, Inc., and Ahold Delhaize. </p><p>For a detailed list of recalled products, which were sold nationwide, look  <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/NewsEvents/ucm627485.htm?utm_campaign=12-3-2018-VitaminD&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Eloqua&elqTrackId=8DB6406376E5A25D0D4B7DE2DB230ABC&elq=91d190916e3644008d73d0f302779c86&elqaid=6140&elqat=1&elqCampaignId=4977\" target=\"_new\">here</a>.</p><p>All the recalled brands were made by a common contract manufacturer.</p><p>The FDA began testing samples after receiving reports that dogs eating certain dry foods suffered vitamin D toxicity. Lab tests found that the recalled dog foods contained as much as 70 times the intended amount of vitamin D.</p><p>Currently, dog food is the only pet food known to be affected, according to the agency. However, it said this is a developing situation, and updates will be issued when new information becomes available.</p><p>If you have bought any of the recalled brands, don't feed the food to your pets. Contact the company listed on the package for further instructions or put the dog food in the garbage and ensure that children, pets and wildlife cannot get at it, the FDA said.</p><p>You can report suspected illness to the FDA electronically through its Safety Reporting Portal:  http://www.safetyreporting.hhs.gov/.</p><p>The FDA also said veterinarians should be aware that vitamin D toxicity may look like hypercalcemia, which can occur after eating rodent poisons. Asking dog owners about diet history can help verify whether the dog has eaten any of the recalled foods.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on keeping your pet healthy at the  <a href=\"https://www.avma.org/public/PetCare/Pages/pet-health.aspx\" target=\"_new\">American Veterinary Medical Association</a>.</p>",

Spending a lot of time sitting leads to shortened hip flexors, the muscles on the front of the hip. This forces the lower back to do more of the work during a golf swing, resulting in pain.</p><p>\"Proactive physical therapy can diagnose this imbalance and improve hip mobility,\" Plafcan said. \"The result is less risk of back pain, plus a more powerful downswing and greater yardage on the golf course.\"</p><p>He also said that one-sided body use in many sports leads to physical imbalance.</p><p>\"A baseball player, tennis player or golfer constantly works one side of the body more than the other, depending on whether the athlete is right-handed or left-handed,\" Plafcan said.</p><p>\"Yes, these athletes need great strength on their dominant sides to excel in their sport, but weakness on the other side of the body can lead to overcompensation and injury,\" he explained. \"By targeting exercise to increase symmetry in strength and flexibility, the athlete can improve overall performance.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons offers <a href=\"https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/staying-healthy/\" target=\"_new\">sports injury prevention tips</a>.</p>",

While some patients recover without treatment, others suffer damage to lungs, heart, lymph nodes, skin and other organs. On the skin, it can cause disfiguring lesions.</p><p>The disease \"alters the immune system which, in turn, leads to increased inflammation in the body,\" explained Dr. Anup Singh, a pulmonologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>\"This increased inflammation may cause non-specific symptoms like cough, weight loss, rash, joint pain and swelling, palpitations, difficulty in breathing, headache or loss of vision,\"  said Singh, who wasn't involved in the new study.</p><p>The new research was led by Dr. Nkiruka Emeagwali, a clinical fellow at Yale Medical School.  She said current treatments for sarcoidosis include steroids or the anti-inflammatory drug known as methotrexate. Neither are reliably effective, however, and both can cause serious side effects, the researchers noted.</p><p>The Yale team suspected -- based on data from earlier trials -- that the rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz might help.  It belongs to a class of medicines called JAK inhibitors, because the drugs act on a specific biochemical pathway called Jak-STAT.</p><p>Researchers had already used this class of drug to successfully treat other chronic skin diseases such as vitiligo, alopecia areata and eczema.</p><p>In the new study, a 48-year-old woman with sarcoidosis took Xeljanz twice a day over several months. Over that time, her skin lesions nearly disappeared, the Yale team reported in the Dec. 27 issue of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p>\"During treatment, not only does her skin disease go away, but there is no activation of the pathway,\" researcher Dr. Nkiruka Emeagwali, a clinical fellow at Yale Medical School, said in a Yale news release.</p><p>In addition, the researchers looked at genetic data from another patient before and during treatment, which proved that the Jak-STAT pathway was involved.</p><p>\"We plan to evaluate the activation of the Jak-STAT pathway in the lung fluid and blood of over 200 patients with pulmonary and multiorgan sarcoidosis,\" she said.</p><p>The findings are being tested further in a clinical trial. If confirmed, they could represent a breakthrough for sarcoidosis patients, the researchers said.</p><p>\"A frequently awful disease, which to date has no reliably effective therapy, may now be targeted with Jak inhibitors,\" said lead researcher Dr. Brett King, an associate professor of dermatology at Yale. \"We have a relatively safe medicine that works.\"</p><p>Singh noted that the patient had exhausted many avenues for treatment.</p><p>She \"had been treated with multiple anti-inflammatory drugs including oral steroids and methotrexate for eight years -- without any improvement of symptoms,\" he said.</p><p>Her success in eliminating sarcoidosis symptoms while taking Xeljanz \"suggests that there is a different pathway of our immune system which is also involved in inflammation seen in patients of sarcoidosis,\" Singh said.</p><p>But he stressed that more study is crucial before the drug becomes a first-line treatment.</p><p>\"This case report has given us hope for a newer treatment alternative in the form of tofacitinib,\" Singh said, but the drug \"will remain an investigational option, until results of future studies are available.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more information on sarcoidosis, visit the <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/sarcoidosis\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</a>.</p>",

Then have them apologize,\" said study author Craig Smith, a research investigator at the university's Center for Human Growth and Development.</p><p>In the study, Smith's team looked at how children viewed three types of apology scenarios among peers: unprompted apologies, prompted but willingly given apologies, and coerced apologies.</p>  <p>While kids viewed willing apologies the same, whether prompted or unprompted by adults, the coerced apologies weren't seen as effective, especially by the 7- to 9-year-olds, Smith noted.</p><p>Children of all ages thought the victims felt better after receiving a willing apology, but they saw the recipient of the forced apology as feeling worse than the recipients of the willing apologies.</p><p>\"Coercing your child to apologize is going to backfire. Other kids don't view that apologizer as likable. The teachable element of having the child apologize has gone away and the goal of the apology prompt -- to help your child express remorse, soothe someone else's hurt feelings and make your child more likable -- is lost,\" Smith explained in a university news release.</p><p>The study was published online recently in the <i>Merrill-Palmer Quarterly</i> journal.</p><p>Smith outlined how parents can help children respond with empathy after they've upset another person.</p><p>\"When your child is calm, help them see how the other person is feeling, and why,\" he said. \"An apology is one way to do it, but there are lots of ways.

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Dec. 5, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- With so much emphasis on fresh, farm-to-table foods, it's easy to overlook the value of canned items. These are convenient, often cheaper alternatives to fresh and frozen.</p><p>Use these tips to help you choose wisely.</p><p>When shopping, look for cans in good shape. Don't buy -- or keep -- cans that are dented, rusted or swollen. Cans have a packing code for tracking them through interstate commerce, but these numbers have nothing to do with their freshness. Look for a \"best if used by\" date for peak quality.</p><p>Canned foods are safe indefinitely as long as they're not exposed to either freezing temperatures or temperatures above 90 degrees. But foods with high acidity, like tomatoes and fruits, taste best if eaten within 12 to 18 months.</p><p>With such a long shelf-life, you can stock up when favorite foods go on sale, especially time-savers like canned beans, which are ready to use. Be sure that you're getting plain cooked beans, not with the added sugar and other ingredients of baked beans, for instance.</p><p>Now for the cautions.</p><p>Watch the salt. Salt, or sodium, is often used as a preservative, but you can shop for low- or reduced-sodium or no-salt-added varieties. Compare the sodium content of different brands on their nutrition labels and choose foods with the lowest amount. You can also drain and rinse canned food to reduce salt.</p><p>Watch the sugar. Again, read the ingredients list and avoid foods with added sugar. Compare the sugar content of different brands on the nutrition labels and choose foods with the lowest amount. When buying canned fruit, look for products that are canned in water or its own juice. If you have no choice, drain and rinse any foods packed in syrup.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln has more tips on <a href=\"https://food.unl.edu/healthy-bites-february-national-canned-food-month\" target=\"_new\">buying, storing and eating</a> canned foods.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 6, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Even with the same treatment, black women with the most common form of breast cancer experience higher recurrence and death rates than white women, a new trial reveals.</p><p>The finding pokes holes in the prevailing notion that black women with breast cancer fare worse due to less access to quality medical care, experts said. While that factor may contribute to poorer outcomes, other factors -- such as the way drugs are metabolized based on race -- may be at play.</p><p>\"Going way back, there's always been the concern about blacks in terms of cancer outcomes over time, but a lot of that was based on population [studies] where treatment wasn't controlled,\" said study author Dr. Kathy Albain. She's chair of oncology research at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine.</p><p>But \"leveling the playing field by bringing women to the same doctors and getting the same treatment\" didn't equalize breast cancer outcomes between black and white women, Albain added.</p>  <p>More than 250,000 women in the United States were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in 2017, according to the American Cancer Society. The disease claims the lives of about 40,000 people each year.</p> <p>Albain and her colleagues evaluated the link between clinical outcomes and race in more than 10,000 women with early stage hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, the most common type of the disease.</p><p>Findings from the same multinational research, known as the TAILORx trial, were released in June showing that most women with early breast cancer don't benefit from chemotherapy. Treating them with chemotherapy and hormone therapy after surgery doesn't improve outcomes more than hormone therapy alone.</p>  <p>In this latest analysis, patients' tumors were analyzed using a molecular test that looks at the expression of 21 genes associated with breast cancer recurrence. About 84 percent of the patients were white, 7 percent were black, 4 percent Asian and 4 percent were of other or unknown race. Ethnically, 79 percent were non-Hispanic, 9 percent were Hispanic and 12 percent were of unknown ethnicity.</p><p>The types, use and length of treatments were similar between both black and white patients and between Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients.</p><p>But outcomes were significantly different: Black women experienced a 39 percent higher risk of breast cancer recurrence compared to white women and a 52 percent higher risk of dying.</p><p>These marked outcome disparities were not explained by reported adherence to therapy, or by factors such as age or tumor size or aggression level, Albain said. But she said it's possible that differences in the way racial groups metabolize drugs could play a role.</p> <p>\"We inherit genes from our parents and the genes that metabolize drugs &hellip; differ,\" Albain said. \"It's not any sort of racial bias, it's just a fact.\"</p><p>Also, because hormone therapy pill adherence was self-reported, she noted, the study authors don't know if black and white patients actually took the pills according to directions, or in the same way.</p><p>\"Patients will tell me all the time they're taking their pills, and they're not taking their pills,\" Albain said. \"Pill-counting wasn't done in this trial\" to confirm what patients reported.</p><p>Dr. Ann Partridge is a breast medical oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and wasn't involved in the new research. But she said she wasn't surprised by the findings and agreed that black and white patients in the study may have adhered to hormonal pill therapy differently.</p><p>\"We know that young people and African-Americans are less adherent with hormonal therapy -- that's been shown over and over again,\" she said.</p> <p>Partridge also noted that exercise behaviors have been shown to differ by race, and that white women tend to exercise more than black women, which could \"have a profound impact\" on cancer outcomes.</p><p>\"This is also true for obesity and diet &hellip; which also tends to be different by race,\" added Partridge, who's also a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.</p> <p>Albain and Partridge agreed that more research is needed to pinpoint all the reasons breast cancer outcomes differ according to race.</p> <p>\"We have to chip away at it all, increase our understanding of disease differences and not lump [factors together] as much as we do,\" Partridge said.</p><p>The research is to be presented Thursday at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in Texas. Research presented at scientific conferences typically hasn't been peer-reviewed or published, and results are considered preliminary.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Cancer Institute offers more information on <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/patient/breast-treatment-pdq\" target=\"_new\">breast cancer treatment</a>.</p>",

About 56 percent said they smoked only factory-made cigarettes, while nearly 37 percent said they smoked only roll-your-own cigarettes.</p><p>Just 16 percent of roll-your-own smokers were highly motivated to quit, compared to 20 percent of factory-made cigarette smokers, according to the University College London (UCL) study. It was published online Dec. 4 in the journal <i>BMJ Open</i>.</p><p>Why the difference? Roll-your-own smokers were less interested in quitting because of the cheaper cost of their cigarettes, the study found. Only factory-made cigarettes are taxed, the researchers explained.</p><p>\"Cost is consistently reported by smokers as one of the primary motives for quitting. With [roll-your-own] cigarettes offering a lower cost alternative to factory-made cigarettes, [roll-your-own] users may be more able to afford to continue to smoke, and therefore less inclined to try to quit,\" said study author Sarah Jackson, from the Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care at UCL.</p><p>\"This has important implications for tobacco control policy, given that a key strategy used by governments worldwide to reduce smoking is to raise taxes on tobacco in order to increase the cost of smoking,\" Jackson said in a university news release.</p><p>Kruti Shrotri, Cancer Research UK's tobacco control expert, agreed.

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 6, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Tamoxifen is considered a vital weapon in the fight against breast cancer, but many women who have to take the drug struggle with its significant side effects.</p><p>Now, new research shows that a lower dose of the hormone therapy helped prevent breast cancer from returning and guarded against new cancers in women who had high-risk breast tissue.</p><p>On top of that, the lower dose -- just 5 milligrams daily -- came with fewer troubling side effects.</p><p>\"Low-dose tamoxifen is as effective as the standard dose,\" said study author Dr. Andrea De Censi. He is director of the medical oncology unit at the National Hospital E.O. Ospedali Galliera -- S.C. Oncologia Medica in Genoa, Italy. </p><p>De Censi said the rate of side effects -- such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, pain during intercourse and muscle pain -- was similar to the rate that occurred with a placebo pill. The side effect rate for the low-dose therapy was significantly less than what previous research has shown with the standard 20 milligram (mg) dose of tamoxifen, he noted. </p><p>In addition, the risk of serious side effects, such as blood clots and endometrial cancer, were similar to that of the placebo, and less than what typically occurs with the 20 mg dose, De Censi said. </p><p>Hormone therapy for breast cancer interferes with the growth of cancer cells in a few ways. One is by blocking the body from producing certain hormones. Another is by disrupting the effects of certain hormones on cancer cells, according to the American Cancer Society. </p><p>In the case of tamoxifen, it works by binding to estrogen-receptors. Some cancers -- those called estrogen-receptor positive -- are fueled by estrogen. Tamoxifen blocks the estrogen-receptors on cancer cells, keeping them from getting the fuel they need to grow. </p><p>De Censi said he was interested in doing the study because the minimum effective dose of tamoxifen hadn't been researched.</p><p>The drug was developed in the late 1960s, he said, and at the time researchers weren't looking for the minimum effective dose because prevention was the key issue. However, above a certain dose, tamoxifen won't produce any extra benefit, but it will raise the risk of side effects, De Censi said. </p><p>The new study included 500 women. They all had either stage 0 breast cancer (called DCIS) or high-risk lesions in their breast tissue that could develop into breast cancer. </p><p>Half of the women took 5 milligrams of tamoxifen daily for three years. The other half took a placebo. The average follow-up time was five years. </p><p>By that time, 5.5 percent of the women taking tamoxifen and about 11 percent of the women taking a placebo had a breast cancer recurrence or a new cancer. </p><p>Taking low-dose tamoxifen lowered the risk of recurrent or new breast cancer by 52 percent, the researchers reported. And the rates of side effects were similar between the two groups. </p><p>About 35 percent of women in the tamoxifen group (and 39 percent in the placebo group) stopped treatment before the study was done. De Censi said if they had continued, it's possible that the low dose of tamoxifen would have proven even more effective. </p><p>Dr. Douglas Marks is a clinical instructor in the oncology/hematology department at NYU Winthrop Hospital in Mineola, N.Y. He said the findings were impressive, and low-dose tamoxifen is a \"very worthy idea to be explored.\"</p><p>But, Marks added, the study doesn't have data for a long enough time period. He said he'd like to see 15 years of follow-up. And the study really needs to compare the 5 mg dose to the standard 20 mg dose to see if it's just as effective.</p><p>\"Different strategies should be evaluated in hormonal therapy,\" Marks said. </p><p>However, women need to know that the current prevention strategies are very effective, he said. If you're taking one of these therapies, talk with your doctor if you're having trouble with side effects, he added. </p><p>\"Before you stop taking a medication, let your doctor know about your side effects. There are a lot of strategies to deal with side effects. Even if you're between appointments, call your doctor to talk about it,\" Marks advised.</p><p>The study is to be presented on Thursday at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Findings presented at meetings are typically viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about hormone therapy for breast cancer from the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/breast-hormone-therapy-fact-sheet\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Cancer Institute</a>.</p>",

It was that strain that made flu so severe last year, when 1 million people were hospitalized and 80,000 died.</p><p>Both of these types of flu are included in this season's flu vaccine, as well as one or two influenza B strains. This year's vaccine seems well matched to these strains, so it will most likely be more effective than last year's vaccine, Budd said.</p><p>Because H1N1 is the predominant flu strain around now, she thinks the vaccine's effectiveness could be as high as 65 percent.</p><p>It's not too late to get vaccinated, Budd said. If you haven't gotten a flu shot, it's time, she said. It can take up to two weeks for your body to mount a protective immune response.</p> <p>\"Now is the time to get vaccinated while flu activity is low, especially if you're going to get together with family over the holidays,\" Budd said.</p><p>She said lots of vaccine is available. Since Nov. 30, nearly 164 million doses have been distributed, Budd said. </p><p>\"We know that the vaccine is effective in preventing millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations,\" she said. \"It's the best tool we have to prevent influenza.\"</p><p>Although getting the vaccine is no guarantee that you won't get the flu, if you do, it will be much milder than if you hadn't been vaccinated, Budd said.</p><p>Vaccination protects not only you from getting the flu, but also those around you from getting it.</p><p>The CDC urges that everyone ages 6 months and older get a flu shot.

Excessive drinking can compromise your immune system and can lead to some forms of cancer,\" said Brad Lander, an addiction medicine specialist at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.</p><p>As you age, your drinking habits may change.

The risk of becoming an alcoholic is greater for women than men, Lander noted.</p><p>Also, according to the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, even after you stop drinking, alcohol continues to enter the bloodstream, resulting in impaired judgment and coordination for hours.</p><p>\"It also can decrease the effectiveness of some medications and highly accelerate others, including over-the-counter medications such as aspirin, acetaminophen, sleeping pills and others,\" Lander added in a center news release.</p><p>Alcohol abuse can also cause problems with balance and reaction times, increasing the chances of accidents and falls.</p><p>Moreover, alcohol can worsen health problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, osteoporosis and liver disease.</p><p>Excessive drinking can also increase the odds of dementia, depression, suicide and impaired sexual functioning, Lander said.</p><p>However, the differences between safe, moderate and heavy drinking is different for everyone.</p><p>\"But the general rule of thumb is to take a close look and honestly assess if drinking is causing any life problems.

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Jan. 8, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- It's a common belief that rising drug prices are due to the high cost of cutting-edge medications, with manufacturers charging a bundle to make back development expenses for their new products.</p><p>But drug companies have also been steadily hiking prices on older brand-name drugs, a new study reports.</p><p>Increasing prices for brand-name pills outpaced the nation's overall rate of inflation nearly fivefold between 2005 and 2016, with consumers paying about 9 percent more every year for the same old drugs between 2005 and 2016.</p><p>The price of injectable brand-name drugs increased by 15 percent yearly during the same period, researchers found.</p><p>\"In the brand-name market, prices are increasing really fast and that's almost solely due to inflation in existing products,\" said lead researcher Inmaculada Hernandez. She's an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy.</p><p>The EpiPen and brand-name insulin products are two prime examples of drugs that have been on the market for a long time, yet have undergone massive price hikes in recent years, Hernandez noted.</p><p>The cost of a two-pack EpiPen injector has increased from around $100 in 2007 to between $300 and $600 today. The list price for Lantus brand insulin increased by 49 percent in 2014, even though the product has been on the market for more than a decade.</p><p><b>Hard choices</b></p><p>These sort of increases on older products undermine efforts by the health care industry to control costs, Hernandez said.</p><p>Steep and arbitrary price hikes for older drugs \"cannot be justified on the basis of more value or better outcomes,\" since people are paying more for products that provide no additional benefit, Hernandez reasoned.</p><p>Price hikes also can cause patients to face hard choices regarding their health. More than one-quarter of people with diabetes have skimped on their insulin shots because of soaring prices, according to a study published in <i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i> last month.</p><p>For the latest study, Hernandez and her colleagues assessed the list price of tens of thousands of medications between 2005 and 2016, using a national database. They also took into account how often the drugs are prescribed, to better reflect each one's contribution to overall U.S. health care costs.</p><p>To assess the impact of new drugs, researchers sorted the meds based on when they entered the market. Drugs were considered \"new\" for the first three years they were available; in the case of generics, for the first three years after patent expiration.</p><p>Prices have been increasing across the board for all drug categories, researchers found.</p><p>For example, generic drug prices have increased by 4.4 percent a year for pills and 7.3 percent annually for injectables.</p><p>And the cost of high-tech specialty medications -- the leading public culprit in rising drug costs -- have been rising annually as well, 20.6 percent for pills and 12.5 percent for injectables.</p><p>Overall, specialty drug prices have risen 13 times faster than national inflation, and even generic pill prices increased by more than double the rate of inflation. However, the cost increases for generic and specialty drugs have been driven largely by new medications entering the market, the study reported.</p><p><b>Profits first?</b></p><p>New drugs accounted for 71 percent of the increase in specialty pill medications and 52 percent of the increase in injectables, researchers said.</p><p>The increase in generics occurs because new generic products tend to cost more, until more manufacturers enter the market and competition drives down prices, Hernandez said.</p><p>There's no apparent reason for the rising cost of brand-name drugs, outside of regular price hikes aimed at boosting company profits, researchers concluded.</p><p>Very few new blockbuster drugs ever enter the brand-name market; new and expensive medications generally are considered specialty drugs, the researchers said.</p><p>\"The United States market for prescribed drugs is really a free-for-all market, and I think we've made peace with that, by and large,\" said Stuart Schweitzer, a professor of health policy and management at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.</p><p>The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), which represents the drug industry, took issue with the new report.</p><p>\"This study provides a flawed and inaccurate portrayal of the U.S. marketplace for medicines,\" said Holly Campbell, the group's deputy vice president of public affairs. She said the wholesale price numbers used in the report failed to \"capture rebates or other types of discounts\" offered by many pharmaceutical companies.</p><p>\"On average, 40 percent of the list price of medicines is given as rebates or discounts to insurance companies, the government, pharmacy benefit managers and other entities in the supply chain that often require large rebates in order for a medicine to be covered,\" Campbell explained.</p> <p>Unfortunately, \"these savings are often not shared with patients whose out-of-pocket costs continue to soar,\" she added.</p><p><b>Lack of competition</b></p><p>But Hernandez said other forces may be at play to send the cost of older drugs skyward, including a lack of competition.</p><p>\"In the case of EpiPen or insulins, they are brand names that have been around for more than one decade at least, and still there's not enough competition\" to cause prices to stay the same or decrease, she said.</p><p>\"Sometimes drug prices make headlines, but usually because they are because of very large prices of new drugs. We want to send the message that year-over-year inflation is a very important contributor to rising drug prices in the brand-name market,\" Hernandez said.</p><p>For his part, Schweitzer questioned whether innovation justifies the high prices of new drugs entering the market.</p><p>\"One argument says the profits have to come from somewhere for innovation, and if you take away those profits then you have less room to innovate,\" said Schweitzer, who wasn't involved with the study.</p><p>\"But the other argument is, no, the drug companies are not stupid, they don't choose projects based on random assignment,\" Schweitzer said. \"They rank every R&amp;D dollar that's spent. They're very, very smart people, and they know when they can absorb falling profits and when they had better not absorb falling profits.\"</p><p>\"According to that argument, the companies are just fine and we could control drug prices more aggressively than we do,\" he concluded.</p><p>The new study was published Jan. 7 in the journal <i>Health Affairs</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The New England Journal of Medicine has more about <a href=\"https://catalyst.nejm.org/what-is-value-based-healthcare/\" target=\"_new\">value-based health care</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 13, 2018 (HealthDay News)  -- Federal health investigators said Thursday that they've pinpointed at least one California farm implicated in the recent outbreak of E. coli illness tied to romaine lettuce, but they added that more farms are probably connected.</p><p>So far, 59 people across 15 states have come down with the often severe gastrointestinal illness. Health concerns were so high that just before Thanksgiving, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked Americans to temporarily stop consuming all romaine lettuce  while they investigated the source of the outbreak.</p><p>That investigation has now uncovered at least one source, experts at the FDA and CDC said in a news briefing Thursday afternoon.</p><p>\"One of the samples tested by the CDC was positive for the outbreak strain by genetic fingerprinting, and was found in the sediment of an agricultural water reservoir at one ranch that is owned and operated by Adam Brothers Farming in Santa Barbara County, Calif.,\" said Dr. Stephen Ostroff, senior advisor to the FDA Commissioner.</p><p>He said the farm was cooperating with the investigation. The farm hasn't shipped romaine lettuce since Nov. 20, and Ostroff said the farm is \"committed to recalling products that may have come into contact with water from the agricultural water reservoir.\"</p><p>That said, other farms in the area might still be  implicated, so \"people should still pay close attention to where their lettuce is from,\" he added.</p><p>Because of this and other recent outbreaks, romaine lettuce now sold in the United States has labeling indicating the place and date of harvest. If heads of romaine are sold loose, without affixed labels, retailers are being asked to post a notice showing place and date of harvest near the store register.</p><p>Most romaine sold in the United States is safe to eat. Right now, precautions are limited to romaine lettuce from just a few California counties, the FDA said.</p><p>\"We continue to advise avoiding romaine lettuce from Monterey, San Benito and Santa Barbara counties in California,\" Ostroff said.</p><p>Hydroponically- and greenhouse-grown romaine also does not appear to be related to the current outbreak.</p><p>Illnesses from the E. coli O157:H7 strain implicated in this outbreak have sometimes been  severe. Although no deaths have been reported, there have 23 hospitalizations and 2 cases of kidney failure, health officials said.</p><p>\"The E. coli strain isolated from ill people in the current romaine lettuce outbreak is also closely related to the E. coli strain isolated from people in a 2017 outbreak linked to leafy green in the United States and romaine lettuce in Canada,\" noted FDA Deputy Commissioner Frank Yiannas.</p><p>So who's most at risk from E. coli?</p><p>Dr. Robert Glatter is an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City who's seen the effects of infection with the gastrointestinal bug firsthand. It's not a minor ailment, he said.</p><p>\"In general, symptoms of E. coli infection generally begin about three to four days after consuming the bacteria, and may include abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and watery or bloody diarrhea, along with fever,\" Glatter said.</p><p>And while healthy people who battle a bout of E. coli typically recover within five to seven days, the illness can be more protracted -- and even deadly -- for people already made vulnerable by chronic disease or advanced age.</p><p>\"People with diabetes, kidney disease or those with cancer or autoimmune disease run the risk of a more severe illness,\" Glatter explained.</p><p>The particular strain of E. coli detected in the current lettuce outbreak -- E. coli O157:H7 -- is particularly nasty, he noted.</p><p>\"Most strains of E. coli do not actually cause diarrhea, but E. coli O157 produces a powerful toxin that injures the inner lining of the small intestine, leading to bloody diarrhea,\" Glatter said. Even a tiny amount of ingested bacteria could spur this type of illness.</p><p>\"It can make people much more ill, and may lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure, in some cases,\" he said.</p><p>In many cases, antibiotics are used to help beat back an E. coli infection, but these drugs can affect the kidneys, Glatter noted.</p><p>\"Antibiotics may be necessary in certain cases, so it's important to see your doctor if you have continued and severe symptoms such as fever, bloody diarrhea, and you are not able to eat or drink,\" he said.</p><p>However, in the case of E. coli O157:H7, \"taking antibiotics may actually increase your risk of developing kidney failure, so it's important to speak with your health care provider if you should develop severe symptoms,\" Glatter advised.</p><p>And if you do think you might be sick with E. coli, or any other foodborne illness, make sure you don't spread it to those near you.</p><p>The bacterium \"can be transmitted person-to-person, so it's vital that anyone who is potentially infected wash their hands thoroughly and not share utensils, cups or glasses,\" Glatter said. \"This also goes for bath towels. Linens also need to be washed in hot water and treated with bleach.\"</p><p>He noted that \"ground beef, unpasteurized milk, fresh produce and contaminated water are common sources of E. coli bacteria.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Find out more about E. coli illness at the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/ecoli-symptoms.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

But don't rule out this convenient fitness option so fast.</p><p>According to the American Council on Exercise, if you can clear a 6-foot by 6-foot area for working out, you can outfit a home gym with the basics for under $100. Plus, these space-conscious items can be stored in a closet or under the bed when not in use. Just don't forget that they're there once you buy them!</p><p>Start with a good mat for floor work, like yoga, Pilates, ab exercises and push-ups. The price typically depends on the thickness you choose, and thickness depends on what you're using it for.</p><p>Next is at least one stability ball for doing a variety of exercises, including balance work and crunches. Choose one made for your weight and height. When you're sitting on it, your thighs should be parallel with the floor.</p><p>Stretchy resistance bands are great for strength training when you don't want a full set of weights. On their own, they weigh nothing and take up less space than a pair of socks. You might buy them in various tensions to match up with the different strengths of  various muscle groups. There are also circular bands that go around your ankles for working the outer hips.</p><p>If you'd like to use dumbbells for upper body work, a set with three pairs of graduated weights is an inexpensive option. If you're a beginner, choose a set with 3-, 5- and 10-pound weights; if you're more experienced, go for 5-, 10- and 15-pounds.</p><p>However, you might get more mileage for your money with a barbell and weight plates -- but again, start with low-weight plates and then add as you gain strength.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For details on putting together an <a href=\"https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/lifestyle/blog/6087/how-to-create-a-home-gym-on-a-tight-budget\" target=\"_new\">inexpensive home gym</a>, check out the website of the American Council on Exercise.</p>",

MacLaughlin is a family medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minn.</p><p>\"Routine screening every three years with a Pap test or every five years with a Pap-HPV co-test [the current guidelines for average-risk women] ensures precancerous changes are caught early and may be followed more closely or treated,\" MacLaughlin explained in a Mayo Clinic news release.</p><p>The study also found significant racial differences in cervical cancer screening rates.</p><p>\"African-American women were 50 percent less likely to be up-to-date on cervical cancer screening than white women in 2016. Asian women were nearly 30 percent less likely than white women to be current on screening. These racial disparities are especially concerning,\" MacLaughlin said. </p><p>For their study, the researchers analyzed data gathered from more than 47,000 women in Olmsted County, Minn., from 2005 to 2016.</p><p>MacLaughlin said the findings show the need for new ways to increase cervical cancer screening rates, such as Pap clinics with evening and Saturday hours, offering cervical cancer screenings at urgent care clinics, and at-home testing kits for HPV (human papillomavirus), the virus that causes most cervical cancers.</p><p>\"We, as clinicians, must start thinking outside the box on how best to reach these women and ensure they are receiving these effective and potentially lifesaving screening tests,\" she said.</p><p>The findings were published Jan. 7  in the <i>Journal of Women's Health</i>.</p><p>About 13,240 new cases of invasive cervical cancer were diagnosed in the United States in 2018, according to the American Cancer Society.

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Feb. 1, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Instead of popping a painkiller, a little mindful yoga might go a long way toward easing longstanding pain, a new study suggests.</p><p>The review of 21 clinical trials involving nearly 2,000 people looked at the effects of two drug-free options for chronic pain: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and a program called mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). It combines meditation and gentle yoga postures.</p><p>In general, patients fared better with either therapy than with no treatment or with standard care, including pain medication.</p><p>Experts said the results point to the value of drug-free alternatives for dealing with chronic pain. That's especially important in the context of the current opioid crisis, said Dr. Muhammad Hassan Majeed, a psychiatrist at Natchaug Hospital in Mansfield Center, Conn.</p><p>For chronic pain that is unrelated to cancer, he said, opioids do not work well. Plus, they carry risks of addiction, overdose and even death.</p><p>Majeed, who was not involved in the new report, has published his own reviews of the evidence for mindfulness and other non-drug approaches for chronic pain.</p><p>The bottom line, he said, is that there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" treatment. Instead, there is a range of potentially effective options that people can try.</p><p>\"Medication is not the only one,\" Majeed said.</p><p>That's not a controversial message. Guidelines for managing chronic pain -- from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other groups -- already discourage doctors from prescribing opioids for most people. They also stress that non-drug choices -- from physical therapy to psychological approaches like CBT -- should be among the \"preferred options.\"</p><p>Why would psychological therapies help? Because chronic pain is not purely physical, Majeed said. There is an emotional component, he explained, and the ways people perceive and respond to their pain are crucial.</p><p>CBT helps people change their habitual thought patterns and reactions around their pain, according to Majeed. Mindfulness practices, like meditation, have a similar goal: The typical definition of mindfulness is to focus on what's happening in the moment, rather than letting the mind spin off.</p><p>Right now, CBT is the most widely used psychological approach to treating chronic pain, said Wei Cheng, one of the researchers on the review.</p><p>Only one study in the review directly compared CBT with mindfulness-based stress reduction. So it's not clear whether mindfulness is as effective as CBT, said Cheng, of the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Ontario, Canada.</p><p>But, he added, not everyone who tries CBT for chronic pain finds it helpful. Mindful practices offer \"an alternative and potentially helpful approach,\" he said.</p><p>The review, published Jan. 31 in <i>Evidence Based Mental Health</i>, pulled together 21 clinical trials. Thirteen compared CBT against a \"control\" -- either no treatment or standard therapies like pain medication. In each study, CBT patients had eight to 12 group sessions with a therapist.</p><p>In seven trials, patients were randomly assigned to either MBSR or a control group. MBSR involved eight to 12 weekly sessions with a therapist trained in the program -- along with 45 minutes of daily home practice.</p><p>The patients had long-standing pain from conditions like arthritis, fibromyalgia and temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ), which affects the jaw. A few trials focused on chronic low back pain.</p><p>Overall, Cheng's team found, patients who received either CBT or MBSR typically fared better than the control group. They reported more improvements in pain intensity, physical functioning and depression symptoms.</p><p>On average, those effects were \"small,\" however, the researchers noted.</p><p>But that's to be expected, according to Majeed. He said patients vary widely in how much relief they get from CBT or mindfulness -- in part, because of the motivation it takes to incorporate what they learn into daily life.</p><p>Plus, Majeed said, while these approaches can help people manage their pain and \"feel better,\" they won't erase the pain.</p><p>For any one person, the choice of whether to try CBT or MBSR will partly depend on personal preferences, according to Majeed. But there are also practical matters, he added, including availability of therapists and insurance coverage.</p><p>MBSR is a specific program. But its components -- mindfulness meditation and gentle yoga -- are available in many formats.</p><p>An important thing to keep in mind, Majeed noted, is that these approaches do not produce instant relief.</p><p>\"It takes time to heal, and to adopt a new lifestyle,\" he said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health has more on <a href=\"https://nccih.nih.gov/health/pain/consumer\" target=\"_new\">pain treatment</a>.</p>",

Now, research confirms the meds can also help people aged 75 and older.</p><p>\"Statin therapy has been shown to prevent cardiovascular disease in a wide range of people, but there has been uncertainty about its efficacy and safety among older people,\" said lead investigator Anthony Keech. He's a professor of medicine, cardiology and epidemiology at the University of Sydney in Australia.</p><p>He and colleagues at the University of Oxford in England analyzed the findings of 28 large clinical trials of statins. The trials involved nearly 187,000 people in six age groups: younger than 55; 55 to 60; 60 to 65; 65 to 70;  70 to 75; and older than 75.</p><p>\"Our study summarized all the available evidence from major trials to help clarify this issue. We found that there were significant reductions in major vascular events in each of the six age groups considered, including patients [who were] aged over 75 at the start of treatment,\" Keech said in an Oxford news release.</p><p>Major vascular events included heart attack, stroke and procedures to clear clogged arteries.</p><p>\"Statin therapy appears to be just as effective in people aged over 75 years as it is in younger people,\" study co-investigator Jordan Fulcher said in the news release. Fulcher is a cardiovascular research fellow at the University of Sydney.</p><p>\"We have definitive evidence that statins benefit older people who have suffered a heart attack or stroke. Fewer healthy older people were represented in these trials, so more information in this group of people would help confirm the same benefits that we see in our overall trials population,\" he said.</p><p>Fulcher noted that a new randomized trial in Australia is exploring whether statins prolong disability-free survival in a healthy population.</p><p>The risk of heart attacks and strokes rises sharply with age, yet statins are not used as widely in older people as they should be, study co-investigator Colin Baigent said in the news release. He's director of Oxford's Medical Research Council Population Health Research Unit.</p><p>\"Since the risk of heart attack and stroke increases with age, the potential benefits are likely to be even greater for older people,\" he said.</p><p>\"Therefore, there is a need to ensure that patients at risk of cardiovascular disease due to their age are offered statin therapy where there is good reason to believe that it will be beneficial,\" Baigent said.</p><p>Anyone with concerns about whether statin therapy is right for them should discuss it with their health care provider, he added.</p><p>The findings were published Jan. 31 in <i>The Lancet</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has more on <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/drugsafety/ucm293474.pdf\" target=\"_new\">statins</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Feb. 20, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental drug has shown promise in extending the lives of women suffering from a particularly aggressive and deadly type of breast cancer, according to the results of a phase 2 trial. </p><p>Right now, the standard treatment of chemotherapy for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer has not been very effective. That might change with the new drug, called sacituzumab govitecan, which combines an antibody with a chemotherapy drug to better target cancer cells. </p><p>In the trial, funded by the drug's maker, about a third of the patients responded to treatment and the effect lasted up to eight months, said  study senior author Dr. Kevin Kalinsky. </p><p>\"These patients had a significant reduction of their cancer,\" he added. \"This is an exciting new therapeutic.\"</p><p>About 50 percent had some response and saw a slowing of cancer progression for about five months, he noted.</p><p>Kalinsky, an oncologist at the Irving Medical Center at New York-Presbyterian-Columbia University, also noted: \"This is a patient population where we really need new therapeutics.\" </p><p>Triple-negative breast cancer represents about 15 percent of all breast cancer and is most often seen in young women and black women, although why it affects these women isn't known, according to Dr. J. Leonard Lichtenfeld, the interim chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society.</p><p>The cancer is different from other breast cancers because tumor cells don't have protein HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), estrogen receptors or progesterone receptors, which means that hormonal treatment or drugs that target HER2 are ineffective. Chemotherapy shrinks or slows its progress in only about 10 percent to 15 percent of these patients, and the effect only lasts about two to three months, the researchers said.</p><p>Survival for women with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer is around a year, and that has not changed for 20 years, they noted.</p><p>In this phase 2 trial, 108 women who had failed treatment with other drugs were treated with sacituzumab govitecan. The drug combines an antibody to the Trop-2 antigen, which is found on most breast cancer cells, with the chemotherapy drug irinotecan.</p><p>When the antibody latches onto the Trop-2 molecules of the cancer cells, the drug is released within cells and into the areas of the tumor. This targeted delivery allows the chemotherapy drug to reach cancer cells and helps reduce the toxic effect of the drug to healthy cells, the researchers said. </p><p>The trial lasted from June 2013 to February 2017 and was funded by New Jersey-based Immunomedics.</p><p>Patients were given the drug for as long as they benefited from treatment, and eight women were still on the drug as of December 2017. The average time of treatment was more than five months, which was longer than the average 2.5 months with patients' other treatments, the researchers found. </p><p>Some of the drug's side effects included nausea, diarrhea and a drop in white blood cells. Researchers said these symptoms were manageable.</p><p>The drug is not yet available, Kalinsky said. A phase 3 trial comparing sacituzumab govitecan with other treatments for triple-negative breast cancer is now underway. </p><p>\"This is a step forward for women where there were not any real treatment options,\" said Lichtenfeld, who was not involved with the study. \"It was not a cure -- we still have a long way to go.\"</p><p>He added that the drug might be more effective if it were given earlier, when the cancer was still confined to the breast. </p><p>\"Even with these results, however, it represents a better outcome than any of the treatments used in this form of breast cancer,\" Lichtenfeld said. </p><p>The report was published Feb. 20 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Cancer Society offers more information on <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer.html/\" target=\"_new\">breast cancer</a>.</p>",

Level A means evidence came from multiple randomized controlled trials. Level B means that evidence came from a single randomized controlled trial or observational studies. And level C means the recommendation is based only on expert opinion.</p><p>Only 8.5 percent of ACC/AHA recommendations relied on level A evidence, while 50 percent had level B data and 41.5 percent had level C data, the researchers found.</p><p>\"In 2009, there was a call for improvement in the clinical research enterprise after [an] earlier study highlighted several deficiencies,\" explained senior study author Dr. Renato Lopes, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at Duke University.</p><p>\"But really, despite some initiatives and a greater focus on conducting randomized controlled trials, the chasm between evidence and the need for evidence has not improved,\" Lopes said in a Duke news release.</p><p>\"As a matter of fact, the proportion of U.S. recommendations from cardiovascular guidelines supported by high-quality evidence actually decreased from 11 percent to 9 percent in the last decade,\" Lopes noted.</p><p>The findings were published online March 15 in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>.</p> <p>According to study lead author Dr. Alexander Fanaroff, \"Patients should have an expectation that the science behind the care they receive is solid and will result in improved outcomes.

It found that opioid use increases the likelihood of A-fib by 34 percent.</p><p>\"We all know that the opioid epidemic is taking an unspeakable human toll through addiction, abuse and overdose, but our findings suggest that the toll may be even greater when we consider the cardiovascular effects opioids may have,\" said lead investigator Dr. Jonathan Stock. He's a resident at Yale New Haven Hospital in Connecticut.</p><p>The researchers said their findings are based on tracking opioid use, not abuse, and show opioids are dangerous even when the drugs are not abused or users are not addicts.</p><p>\"Our results point to the importance of prescribing opioids only as a last resort,\" Stock said. \"Opioid use, by itself, must be taken seriously and efforts should be made, not only to reduce opioid abuse and overdoses, but to ensure patients are being prescribed opioids only when absolutely necessary.\"</p><p>For the study, Stock's team analyzed medical records of more than 857,000 veterans between the ages of 25 and 51.</p><p>About 3,000 of them had been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. Of those, nearly 29 percent had used opioids, compared with 15 percent of vets without the heart irregularity.</p><p>The risk for a-fib remained even after researchers accounted for other heart disease risk factors. </p><p>Of concern was the finding that atrial fibrillation was seen in young healthy people. The average age of those in the study was 38. The abnormality is typically more common among those 65 and older.</p><p>The researchers offered a possible reason for the link between opioid use and a-fib. They theorize that opioids may lead to or worsen breathing problems during sleep as well as obstructive sleep apnea, a known risk factor for cardiac rhythm disturbances.</p><p>The findings are to be presented Nov. 10 at a meeting of the American Heart Association in Chicago. </p><p>Research presented at meetings is typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p> To learn more about atrial fibrillation, visit the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/atrial-fibrillation\" target=\"_new\"> American Heart Association</a>.</p>",

In fact, she was planning to franchise a popular workshop that offers classes devoted to the activity.</p> <p>\"You go in with friends, drink wine and make a custom piece of wooden pallet art for your home decor,\" she said. \"It's fun.\" Unfortunately, fate had other plans.</p> <p>One morning in February 2017, while getting her children ready for school, Amy felt a heavy sensation in her chest. Her arms began to ache so badly that she couldn't finish brushing her daughter's hair. Within minutes, her skin turned pale and she started to hyperventilate. </p> <p>Although Amy had never experienced a panic attack, that was her best guess about what was happening. </p> <p>\"What else could it be?\" she said. After all, she was young, healthy and active, regularly participating in spinning classes and playing competitive tennis matches against her husband, John Paul.</p> <p>Admittedly stubborn by nature, Amy was adamant that John Paul not dial 911. He did it anyway. Her stubborn streak continued when the paramedics arrived. She insisted upon walking to the ambulance. As paramedics checked her vital signs, she tried to convince them that she was fine. </p> <p>Then her heart stopped.</p> <p>As the ambulance sped to the hospital, paramedic Dave Sauls performed CPR. \"I kept expecting her to come out of it,\" he said, \"but it wasn't happening.\"</p> <p>At the emergency room, the nurses took over chest compressions and continued to perform CPR and AED shocks for nearly 45 minutes.</p> <p>An angiogram revealed a 100 percent blockage of her left anterior descending artery. This type of heart attack is commonly known as the widow maker. Worse yet, the blockage was caused by spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), meaning a tear in the artery wall.</p> <p>SCAD is a rare event that occurs mostly in women (about 80 percent), with an average age younger than 50. Other disorders are believed to make people more likely to suffer SCAD. One of them is a disease of the blood vessels called fibromuscular dysplasia, which Amy was later diagnosed with having. </p> <p>At her local hospital, doctors decided she needed more specialized help than they could provide.</p> <p>Amy spent nine days in a medically induced coma. Once she awoke, she saw John Paul sitting at the foot of her hospital bed. She had no idea of what had happened. </p> <p>After the sedatives and other medications left her system, Amy felt so wired she couldn't sleep a wink for two straight days (\"my eyes were like saucers,\" she said). Watching the clock tick away hour by hour, she was terrified she could experience another heart attack at any moment. Any sort of chest pain causes her anxiety to this day.</p> <p>\"Since I don't remember what it felt like, I don't have a frame of reference,\" she said. \"It's terrifying -- the inner turmoil of a cardiac patient.\"</p> <p>After 21 days in the hospital, and surviving bouts of double pneumonia and a narrowing of her trachea, Amy was released. It took more than a year for her to start feeling like herself again.</p> <p>Although her heart function is permanently compromised, she is working to build strength and stamina. In the past, Amy didn't consider it a workout unless she was drenched in sweat. But that's no longer possible. Nor are the competitive tennis matches with John Paul.</p> <p>\"It's been a hard adjustment,\" Amy said. \"I had to shift my mentality a bit. It's about how much I can get done before my heart rate hits 160 bpm.\"</p> <p>One day, Dave Sauls, the paramedic, received a Facebook message from John Paul.</p> <p>Dave had heard Amy died. So, of course, he was \"flabbergasted\" by the message that said she was recovering at home.</p> <p>\"It was a gift from God in my life and something I needed at the time,\" he said. \"I sat there and cried.\"</p> <p>Since then, Dave and Amy have become close friends. He has trained many of her friends in CPR. </p> <p>Eager to raise awareness about women's heart health in general and SCAD specifically, Amy has recorded local public service announcements and attended fundraising walks.</p> <p>\"I look at it as my responsibility to warn other women that this can happen to anybody,\" Amy said. \"I didn't believe that it could happen to me, and my stubbornness almost cost my kids their mother.\"</p> <p>While it still stings that somebody else bought the home decor and art-making franchise that Amy wanted to buy into, she continues to make and sell her own pieces. She uses the name Heartwood, which her children suggested.</p> <p>\"This,\" she said, \"is my therapy.\" </p>",

She is an associate professor of psychology at the University of Arizona.</p><p>Edgin and her colleagues assessed 25 children with Down syndrome, average age 4.5 years, and 24 typically developing children, average age 2.5 years.</p><p>The researchers tested the children's ability to remember new words 5 minutes after they'd learned the words. The children were then tested again 4 hours after they'd learned the words and stayed awake, 4 hours after they'd learned the words and had a nap, and 24 hours later.</p><p>The typically developing children were more likely to remember the new words 4 hours and 24 hours after learning them if they took a 90-minute nap shortly after learning the word. </p><p>However, if the children with Down syndrome napped after learning the words, they were much less likely to remember them 4 hours and 24 hours later than if they didn't nap, the findings showed.</p><p>The study was published Oct. 29 in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>.</p><p>Further research is needed to learn why naps may harm learning in children with Down syndrome, said Edgin, who noted that REM sleep is reduced in people with Down syndrome. REM is a normal stage of sleep that is characterized by rapid eye movements, more dreaming and bodily movement, and faster pulse and breathing. </p><p>\"There might be something about getting too little REM sleep and not completing that REM stage that could be related to difficulties with retention,\" Edgin said in a university news release. </p><p>\"There are some recent studies that suggest that people show poorer retention if they get just a little bit of REM than if they get a whole REM cycle,\" she explained. \"More work needs to be done, but REM sleep is definitely something to consider.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The National Down Syndrome Society has more on <a href=\"https://www.ndss.org/\" target=\"_new\">Down syndrome</a>.</p>",

But there are safety precautions to take when you leave a protected indoor environment.</p><p>The Road Runners Club of America has a wealth of advice.</p><p>For starters, take some precautions before you leave home. First, tell loved ones where you'll be running. Next, in addition to taking ID with you, write your name, phone number and blood type (in case of an accident) inside one of your running shoes. Also, carry your cellphone.</p><p>\"There's safety in numbers\" is an old expression that still holds true. Steer clear of unpopulated areas, deserted or unlit streets, even overgrown trails. Trust your intuition -- if a situation just doesn't feel right, stay away from it. Also get in the habit of varying your running pattern, but do run in familiar areas.</p><p>While it's easy to lose yourself in your thoughts or music, stay alert. That means skipping the headphones. You want both your eyes and ears attuned to your environment.</p><p>Whether you run on city streets or country roads, go against the flow of traffic so you can see oncoming vehicles and they can see you. This should allow you to react more quickly to a problem.</p><p>Remember mom's lessons about crossing streets -- look both ways at all intersections. Do obey traffic signals, and don't blindly assume that drivers will see you or that they'll stop for you, especially those turning into your path.</p><p>If you want to go running while traveling, ask the local running club or running store for safe routes. Stick to areas with open businesses in case of an emergency and, of course, follow all the safety steps you would at home.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more <a href=\"https://www.rrca.org/education/rrca-general-running-safety-tips\" target=\"_new\">safety tips</a> check out the website of the Road Runners Club of America.</p>",

She is program director in the College of Humanities and Sciences at the University of Phoenix.</p><p>\"However, for veterans, that has not translated into a shift in the perception of mental health. Many of our veterans served in a culture where talking about your feelings or seeking help was not widely accepted,\" she added in a university news release.</p><p>The recently released survey results bear that out: More than 90 percent of all veterans and active-duty service members said mental health is as important as physical health. But only 30 percent of veterans have sought or considered mental health counseling, compared with 72 percent of active-duty service members.</p><p>This difference may be because veterans retain old stereotypes and stigmas associated with mental health counseling, the researchers noted.</p><p>The survey also found that 89 percent of active-duty military members believe people who receive professional counseling generally get somewhat or a lot better, compared with 66 percent of veterans.</p><p>In addition, 91 percent of active-duty service members say their leaders openly discuss the importance of dealing with mental health concerns, while only 23 percent of veterans say that their leaders did so.</p><p>When veterans were asked what resources they would use to manage mental health, free counseling was the most common response  (39 percent).</p><p>Fifty-eight percent of veterans said they would be encouraged to seek mental health counseling if a close colleague, friend or family member discussed their experiences receiving counseling.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Mental Health has more on <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies/index.shtml\" target=\"_new\">counseling</a>.</p>",

However, one aspect of recordkeeping -- how often to get on the scale -- has been the subject of much debate.</p><p>Daily weigh-ins used to be thought of as negative, capable of discouraging you if the pounds didn't come off fast enough, or if day-to-day fluctuations were frustrating. But more recent research has found that it can be a powerful motivator.</p><p>While there's a lot more to dropping pounds than just getting on the scale, weighing yourself can be an important part of the plan. One study found participants achieved weight loss success with daily self-monitoring that included a weigh-in, counting steps and recording fruit, vegetable and water intake.</p><p>Stepping on the scale every day can also help you avoid the natural tendency to gain weight as you age by alerting you early on should pounds sneak on, enabling you to adjust your calorie intake. And, equally important, it plays a role in maintaining weight loss.</p><p>Surveys show that people who successfully keep weight off are more likely to weigh themselves frequently as part of their maintenance plan. The scale in essence functions as an early warning detection system, showing you if your weight starts to creep up.</p><p>The problem is that, over time, people lose interest in tracking their weight, said University of Pittsburgh researchers who followed a group of dieters for a year and a half. Even though weigh-ins helped with weight loss over the first 6 months, adherence to using the scale progressively declined over the following year.</p><p>The answer is to make getting on the scale as much of a habit as brushing your teeth, and to log your weight every day, whether you use your computer, smartphone or an old-school paper record.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Consumer Reports has more tips on <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/scales/the-best-time-to-weigh-yourself/\" target=\"_new\">the best ways to weigh yourself</a> for accuracy and motivation.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Jan. 15, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- A stem cell transplant may help some people with multiple sclerosis (MS) when standard drugs fail, a new clinical trial finds.</p><p>The study focused on 110 patients with aggressive cases of MS: Their symptoms had flared up at least twice in the past year despite taking standard medication, and they'd already tried an average of three of those drugs.</p><p>Researchers randomly assigned the patients to either keep trying other medications or have a stem cell transplant -- using cells taken from their own blood.</p><p>Over an average of three years, MS progressed in 34 of 55 patients on medication -- meaning their disabilities worsened. That compared with only three of 55 patients given a stem cell transplant.</p><p>It's a striking difference, said lead researcher Dr. Richard Burt, adding that the results were even better than his team anticipated.</p><p>That said, Burt cautioned that only a small minority of MS patients would be possible transplant candidates. And for now, only certain medical centers have the necessary experience and expertise.</p><p>\"Any treatment that is powerful can also be dangerous,\" said Burt, who is chief of immunotherapy and autoimmune diseases at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. \"You don't want to use it too soon, or too late. And you don't want to overuse it.\"</p><p>Those precautions were echoed by Bruce Bebo, executive director of research for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.</p><p>\"This study should be celebrated,\" said Bebo, who was not involved in the research. \"It's the first randomized, controlled clinical trial of this strategy.\"</p><p>But, he stressed, the treatment is still experimental and can only be done safely at a handful of centers around the world. </p><p>Stem cell transplants are done at many hospitals to treat cancer. But, Bebo said, there's an \"art and science\" to using them for MS.</p><p>MS is a neurological disorder caused by a misguided immune system attack on the body's own myelin -- the protective sheath around nerve fibers in the spine and brain. Depending on where the damage occurs, symptoms include vision problems, muscle weakness, numbness and difficulty with balance and coordination.</p><p>About 85 percent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with the \"relapsing-remitting\" form of the disease, according to the National MS Society. That means symptoms flare up for a time and then ease. But most people eventually transition to a progressive form of the disease and their disability worsens over time.</p><p>The new trial included only patients with relapsing-remitting MS, because that point in the disease is when immune system inflammation is inflicting its damage.</p><p>Why would a stem cell transplant help? The idea, Burt explained, is to basically \"reboot\" the immune system and stop it from attacking.</p><p>Stem cells from the bone marrow are the building blocks of the immune system. In this trial, patients had a supply of their own bone marrow stem cells removed and stored, then underwent a few days of chemotherapy to knock down their existing immune system.</p><p>After that, the stored stem cells were infused back into the body, where over time, the immune system rebuilt itself.</p><p>Half of the study patients had that procedure. The other half continued with disease-modifying drugs -- like natalizumab (Tysabri), interferon (Avonex) and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone). Those medications can slow, but not stop, MS progression, Burt said.</p><p>Over the next few years, stem cell transplant patients were much less likely to see their MS progress, the study found.</p><p>\"And, Burt said, \"their quality of life markedly improved.\"</p><p>When patients rated their quality of life on a standard scale, the transplant group reported an average 20-point gain one year later. Those ratings dipped a few points among patients on medication.</p><p>The study, published in the Jan. 15 issue of the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>, was funded by government and foundation grants.</p><p>Burt cautioned that stem cell transplants carry risks, including serious, even fatal, infections while the immune system is suppressed. No patient in this trial died.</p><p>Bebo also pointed out that the study patients did not take the newest MS drugs, such as a medication called Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), which was approved after this trial ended in 2016.</p><p>\"It's unclear how stem cell transplants compare with the most effective current drug therapies,\" Bebo said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The National MS Society has more on <a href=\"https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Research/Research-News-Progress/Stem-Cells-in-MS/Bone-Marrow-Stem-Cell-Transplant-%E2%80%93-HSCT\" target=\"_new\"> stem cell transplants</a>.</p>",

In one patient, symptoms occurred three days after receiving the drug.</p><p>One MS specialist said the information is important to people with MS, but it shouldn't mean they must immediately stop using the drug.</p><p>\"One must always weigh the risks and benefits of treatment in relation to the risk of the underlying disease process,\" said Dr. Asaff Harel, a neurologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He said that for many patients, Lemtrada is a really effective therapy, so \"the benefits may outweigh potential risks for some patients.\"</p><p>In the meantime, the FDA said it is mandating a new warning about these risks to the prescribing information on the drug label and to the patient Medication Guide. The risk of stroke has also been added to the existing boxed warning, the agency said.</p><p>Alemtuzumab is also approved under the brand name Campath to treat a type of cancer called B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). The label of that drug will also be updated to include the risk of stroke and tears in the lining of the head (arterial dissection), the FDA said.</p><p>If patients taking alemtuzumab develop signs or symptoms of a stroke or arterial dissection, they or their caregivers must seek emergency treatment as soon as possible.</p><p>Symptoms can include: sudden numbness or weakness in the face, arms, or legs, especially on only one side of the body; sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or difficulty understanding speech; sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes; sudden trouble with walking, dizziness, or loss of balance or coordination; sudden severe headache or neck pain.</p><p>At every Lemtrada infusion, health care providers should advise patients to seek immediate emergency medical help if they develop symptoms of stroke or arterial dissection, the FDA said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more on <a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Multiple-Sclerosis-Information-Page\" target=\"_new\">multiple sclerosis</a>.</p>",

The study included hundreds of participants, either with autism or without the disorder.</p><p>The autism group had prolonged connectivity (up to 20 seconds) between brain areas, while those links faded much more quickly in people without autism, the findings showed.</p><p>The researchers also found that the autism symptoms increased with the duration of connectivity between brain regions.</p><p>\"This is a whole new perspective into how autism works in the brain, and can help us develop strategies for treatment and finding medications that might be more effective to ease the symptoms of the disorder,\" Anderson said in a university news release.</p><p>One in every 59 children in the United States has an autism spectrum disorder, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

But one health expert suggests that these folks can still enjoy festive gatherings, as long as they take certain precautions.</p><p>About 5 percent of children and 4 percent of adults in the United States have a food allergy, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. The most common allergens are milk, egg, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish and shellfish.</p><p>\"It's important for people to remember that even though the main ingredients in a dish may be fine, some ingredients can be hidden and cause allergic reactions,\" said Dr. Russell Traister. He is an allergist and immunologist at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C.</p><p>People with food allergies need to be aware of cross-contamination. For example, peanut protein can remain on a bowl or work surface for up to five hours and still cause a severe reaction for someone with a peanut allergy.</p><p>In addition, people with food allergies should always have an EpiPen or the generic version of the epinephrine auto-injector with them. They should make sure it has not expired, and that friends and family members know how to use it, Traister said.</p><p>If you're attending a holiday gathering with a child or other family member who has food allergies, bring at least one dish that's safe for them in case there aren't any other options, he said.</p><p>If you're hosting a get-together, keep all prepared food packaging so guests can check the ingredients for any potential allergens.</p><p>Food allergy symptoms can range from rashes, coughing and vomiting to potentially life-threatening reactions, such as swelling of the tongue and the inability to breathe.</p><p>\"If you think you or a friend or family member is having an allergic reaction and you don't have an epinephrine auto-injector with you, call 911 immediately or go to the closest emergency department,\" Traister said in a Wake Forest news release.</p><p>\"Even if you use your epinephrine auto-injector, you should still seek medical attention to prevent a second reaction,\" he added.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians has more on <a href=\"https://familydoctor.org/condition/food-allergies/?adfree=true\" target=\"_new\">food allergies</a>.</p>",

They then tracked weight gain in the babies to age 3 years.</p><p>Antibiotics and antimicrobial agents can alter any person's gut makeup (microbiome) by killing off certain species of bacteria, which allows room for others to blossom.</p><p>The most notorious example is <i>Clostridium difficile</i>, a bacteria that can flourish from overuse of antibiotics and lead to life-threatening diarrhea.</p><p>According to Kozyrskyj, \"Disinfectant products used very often, weekly or greater, did cause changes to the infants' gut bacteria. It caused some bacteria to decline and others to increase.\" </p><p>Specifically, antibacterial cleaners were linked to an increase in gut levels of <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> in infants.</p><p><i>Lachnospiraceae</i> bacteria should not be heavily present in the guts of babies who are not yet on solid food, explained Gail Cresci, an expert in pediatric gastroenterology with the Cleveland Clinic.</p><p>These bacteria typically are \"good\" bacteria that feed on tough-to-digest carbohydrate fibers, contributing extra energy to the body, Cresci said.</p><p>\"You don't start to see them until the diet has been advanced to solids, around the age of 2 or 3,\" she added.</p><p>Having an abundance of <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> bacteria from an early age could cause growing kids to be bombarded with additional calories, Cresci said.</p><p>\"It could make sense that if there is an increase of these bacteria early, at 3 months, it could then allow the microbiome to harvest more energy and at that age, it would be stored as fat,\" Cresci explained. \"That could potentially contribute to obesity later.\"</p><p>Infants living in homes with the highest use of disinfectants were twice as likely to have a gut microbiome enriched with <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, the researchers reported.</p><p>Higher <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> levels were associated with higher BMI scores at ages 1 and 3, according to the report.</p><p> Kozyrskyj said that the researchers  \"found that those <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> elevated with disinfectant use were likely responsible for this overweight development.

Of those, nearly 4 percent died after readmission.</p><p>Among heart attack patients, the rates were 17 percent and 7 percent, respectively, according to the study. </p><p>\"Our findings show that Takotsubo syndrome still presents considerable risk to patients after they're initially discharged from the hospital,\" said senior investigator Dr. Harmony Reynolds, an associate professor of medicine at NYU Langone.</p><p>\"Even though the heart muscle recovers full function in survivors, there are lasting effects on the body. Physicians should monitor Takotsubo patients carefully,\" Reynolds said.</p><p>The researchers noted that the most common cause of hospital readmission among patients with broken heart syndrome was heart failure. It was diagnosed in 11 percent of broken heart syndrome patients and in 13 percent of heart attack patients.</p><p>The study also found that compared to heart attack patients, broken heart syndrome patients were younger and more likely to be women.

The women's average age was 37. The group included 23 women from the United Kingdom, seven from the United States, and one from Norway. </p><p>The most common reason for egg freezing was not having a partner or having a partner who wouldn't commit to fatherhood, the findings showed.</p><p>Some of the women said they wanted to relieve the pressure of trying to find a suitable partner. Many said they hoped never to have to use their frozen eggs because they would conceive naturally with a future partner. Several said that freezing their eggs was emotionally difficult because they wanted to become mothers with a committed partner.</p><p>The researchers also found that the information available to women considering freezing their eggs was inadequate.

            "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Dec. 5, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Checking for low hemoglobin in the blood -- otherwise known as anemia -- usually means drawing blood for testing.</p><p>But scientists say they've developed a wireless smartphone app that does the same by \"reading\" a quick photo of your fingernail.</p><p>The app converts fingernail colors into quick readings of blood hemoglobin levels, according to researchers at Emory University in Atlanta. They said the technology could be used by anyone at any time, but its use right now is  limited to screening, not a formal diagnosis of anemia.</p><p>Anemia is a blood condition affecting 2 billion people worldwide. If untreated, it can lead to fatigue, paleness and heart problems.</p><p>Typical methods of screening for anemia \"require external equipment, and represent trade-offs between invasiveness, cost and accuracy,\" lead researcher Dr. Wilbur Lam, associate professor of pediatrics, explained in an Emory news release.</p><p>But the new app has an accuracy that's \"on par with currently available point-of-care tests,  without the need to draw blood,\" Lam said.</p><p>The investigators believe the app could be useful for screening pregnant women, women with abnormal menstrual bleeding, or runners and other athletes. Its simplicity also means it could help people in developing countries.</p><p>The app could be available for download as soon as spring 2019, the researchers said.</p><p>One member of the development team, Rob Mannino, had a personal stake in the technology's success. The former biomedical engineering graduate student has an inherited blood disorder called beta-thalassemia.</p><p>\"Treatment for my disease requires monthly blood transfusions,\" Mannino explained in the news release. \"My doctors would test my hemoglobin levels more if they could, but it's a hassle for me to get to the hospital in between transfusions to receive this blood test. Instead, my doctors currently have to just estimate when I'm going to need a transfusion, based on my hemoglobin level trends.\"</p><p>In the new study, published Dec. 4 in <i>Nature Communications</i>, Lam's team used data on 237 people -- some anemic, some not -- to develop an algorithm that converted fingernail color to represent blood hemoglobin levels.</p><p>It was then tested on 100 patients and proved highly accurate in people with both dark and light skin tones, the research team said. That's because the nail bed does not contain melanin, which gives skin its color.</p><p>The app should enable patients with chronic anemia to monitor themselves to know when they need to adjust their therapies or receive transfusions. This could reduce side effects or complications of having transfusions too early or too late, Lam's team said.</p><p>Mannino's experience proved integral to the research.</p><p>\"This whole project couldn't have been done by anyone but Rob,\" Lam said. \"He took pictures of himself before and after transfusions as his hemoglobin levels were changing, which enabled him to constantly refine and tweak his technology on himself in a very efficient manner. So essentially, he was his own perfect initial test subject with each iteration of the app.\"</p><p>One doctor who often treats anemia in children was optimistic about the new technology, with one caveat.</p><p>Dr. Michael Grosso directs pediatrics at Huntington Hospital in Huntington, N.Y. He agreed that \"the availability of a rapid, accurate and non-invasive anemia screening test could have significant benefits.\"</p><p>But he was concerned that the app might miss more subtle forms of anemia.</p><p>\"It turns out that mild iron deficiency can affect the body without triggering anemia, and children in that situation would be missed by the non-invasive test,\" Grosso said. \"So, the smartphone test definitely falls short of the tried-and-true blood count, but it is better than no test at all.\"</p><p>For their part, Lam and colleagues said further research, conducted with a variety of patient types, is ongoing. That means the app's sensitivity and accuracy should improve with time.</p><p>\"This is just a snapshot of the accuracy right now,\" Lam said. \"The algorithm gets smarter with every patient enrolled.\"</p><p>The research was funded in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Lam and Mannino have filed a patent application for the anemia app, and will have financial interest in its success.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has more on <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/anemia\" target=\"_new\">anemia</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Jan. 4, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- More than 10 percent of U.S. adults have a food allergy -- and nearly double that believe they do, a new study estimates.</p><p>Researchers found that 19 percent of those surveyed thought they had a food allergy. But when the investigators dug into people's symptoms, they found that only 10.8 percent reported \"convincing\" signs of a true allergy.</p><p>Experts said the findings highlight two important facts: Food allergies are common among U.S. adults, and many mistakenly believe they have one.</p><p>\"There are many misconceptions around reactions to food,\" said lead researcher Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University, in Chicago.</p><p>According to Gupta, it can be easy for people to assume food-related symptoms signal an allergy. But other conditions can be the real culprit, she said.</p><p>People with true allergies have an immune system reaction against proteins in a particular food. Those reactions, Gupta explained, can sometimes be severe -- including life-threatening breathing difficulties or drops in blood pressure.</p><p>So it's critical to get an accurate diagnosis, she noted.</p><p>Dr. Wayne Shreffler, a medical advisor to the non-profit Food Allergy Research &amp; Education, agreed.</p><p>\"Sometimes people think, 'What difference does it make? If the food makes me feel bad, I'll avoid it,'\" Shreffler said.</p><p>But people with a true allergy need to completely eliminate the offending food from their diet -- and they should get professional guidance on how to do that, he suggested.</p><p>They should also get a prescription for epinephrine, Shreffler said. The drug, given by auto-injector, treats severe allergic reactions in an emergency.</p><p>On the flip side, food avoidance can be very challenging -- so people without an allergy should not do it unnecessarily, he added.</p><p>What other conditions can cause food-related woes? One possibility, Gupta said, is a food intolerance -- such as difficulty digesting lactose, a sugar in milk.</p><p>Unlike allergies, food intolerances do not involve the immune system. They arise from an issue in the digestive system -- like an enzyme deficiency -- that makes it hard to break down a particular food.</p><p>In other cases, Gupta said, people have an oral allergy syndrome. That occurs when someone with a pollen allergy has a reaction to a food with proteins similar to pollen -- usually a raw fruit or vegetable. The symptoms include itchiness in the mouth or throat, or swelling around the lips.</p><p>That type of reaction is not life-threatening, and people may be able to avert it by simply cooking the offending produce, Gupta said.</p><p>The study, published online Jan. 4 in <i>JAMA Network Open</i>, included more than 40,400 U.S. adults.</p><p>Overall, 19 percent reported food allergies. However, only 10.8 percent had ever suffered \"convincing\" symptoms -- such as hives, throat constriction, lip or tongue swelling, vomiting, difficulty breathing or rapid heartbeat.</p><p>Certain other symptoms -- like cramps or diarrhea -- were not considered convincing, because they are more likely to indicate a food intolerance.</p><p>Among people with true allergies, shellfish was the most common culprit: An estimated 3 percent of adults were allergic to shellfish. Milk allergy (1.9 percent) and peanut allergy (1.8 percent) were next in line. Many people had more than one food allergy, the findings showed.</p><p>And surprisingly, allergies often developed in adulthood, rather than childhood. Almost half of participants with convincing symptoms developed at least one of their allergies as an adult, according to the report.</p><p>It has long been known that adults can develop new food allergies. But Gupta was \"really surprised\" by how often that was reported in the study.</p><p>Shreffler agreed, calling the finding \"striking.\"</p><p>It's not fully clear why food allergies arise in adults, according to Shreffler. But in some cases, he said, it may be a matter of exposure. Many kids turn their noses up at shellfish, for example -- so an allergy might not become apparent until later in life.</p><p>Gupta's team also found that only half of study participants with convincing food allergy symptoms had ever received a formal diagnosis.</p><p>Some may self-diagnose and skip the doctor visit, both Gupta and Shreffler said. But it's also possible for doctors to miss the diagnosis.</p><p>\"I think that finding is a bit of a wake-up call to the medical community,\" Shreffler said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Food Allergy Research &amp; Education has more on <a href=\"https://www.foodallergy.org/life-with-food-allergies/food-allergy-101/diagnosis-testing\" target=\"_new\">food allergy diagnosis</a>.</p>",

The study included hundreds of participants, either with autism or without the disorder.</p><p>The autism group had prolonged connectivity (up to 20 seconds) between brain areas, while those links faded much more quickly in people without autism, the findings showed.</p><p>The researchers also found that the autism symptoms increased with the duration of connectivity between brain regions.</p><p>\"This is a whole new perspective into how autism works in the brain, and can help us develop strategies for treatment and finding medications that might be more effective to ease the symptoms of the disorder,\" Anderson said in a university news release.</p><p>One in every 59 children in the United States has an autism spectrum disorder, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They typically have difficulty with communication, repetitive behaviors and socializing. Symptoms may range from mild to severe.</p><p>According to study first author Jace King, the findings provide researchers \"with new tools to figure out the mechanisms that may underlie autism.\" King is  a postdoctoral research associate in the university's Brain Network Lab.</p><p>But Anderson said the team first needs to validate the results from this analysis in other groups of people. </p><p>The study was published online recently in <i>JAMA Network Open</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\" https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/index.html \" target=\"_new\">autism</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 2, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Creating art and tackling do-it-yourself projects are soothing pastimes for many people, and 37-year-old Amy Cavaliere is one of them.</p><p>The mother of three from Royersford, Pennsylvania -- about a half hour from Philadelphia -- enjoys making pallet wall art that combines hand-stenciled words and imagery on stained wood. In fact, she was planning to franchise a popular workshop that offers classes devoted to the activity.</p> <p>\"You go in with friends, drink wine and make a custom piece of wooden pallet art for your home decor,\" she said. \"It's fun.\" Unfortunately, fate had other plans.</p> <p>One morning in February 2017, while getting her children ready for school, Amy felt a heavy sensation in her chest. Her arms began to ache so badly that she couldn't finish brushing her daughter's hair. Within minutes, her skin turned pale and she started to hyperventilate. </p> <p>Although Amy had never experienced a panic attack, that was her best guess about what was happening. </p> <p>\"What else could it be?\" she said. After all, she was young, healthy and active, regularly participating in spinning classes and playing competitive tennis matches against her husband, John Paul.</p> <p>Admittedly stubborn by nature, Amy was adamant that John Paul not dial 911. He did it anyway. Her stubborn streak continued when the paramedics arrived. She insisted upon walking to the ambulance. As paramedics checked her vital signs, she tried to convince them that she was fine. </p> <p>Then her heart stopped.</p> <p>As the ambulance sped to the hospital, paramedic Dave Sauls performed CPR. \"I kept expecting her to come out of it,\" he said, \"but it wasn't happening.\"</p> <p>At the emergency room, the nurses took over chest compressions and continued to perform CPR and AED shocks for nearly 45 minutes.</p> <p>An angiogram revealed a 100 percent blockage of her left anterior descending artery. This type of heart attack is commonly known as the widow maker. Worse yet, the blockage was caused by spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), meaning a tear in the artery wall.</p> <p>SCAD is a rare event that occurs mostly in women (about 80 percent), with an average age younger than 50. Other disorders are believed to make people more likely to suffer SCAD. One of them is a disease of the blood vessels called fibromuscular dysplasia, which Amy was later diagnosed with having. </p> <p>At her local hospital, doctors decided she needed more specialized help than they could provide.</p> <p>Amy spent nine days in a medically induced coma. Once she awoke, she saw John Paul sitting at the foot of her hospital bed. She had no idea of what had happened. </p> <p>After the sedatives and other medications left her system, Amy felt so wired she couldn't sleep a wink for two straight days (\"my eyes were like saucers,\" she said). Watching the clock tick away hour by hour, she was terrified she could experience another heart attack at any moment. Any sort of chest pain causes her anxiety to this day.</p> <p>\"Since I don't remember what it felt like, I don't have a frame of reference,\" she said. \"It's terrifying -- the inner turmoil of a cardiac patient.\"</p> <p>After 21 days in the hospital, and surviving bouts of double pneumonia and a narrowing of her trachea, Amy was released. It took more than a year for her to start feeling like herself again.</p> <p>Although her heart function is permanently compromised, she is working to build strength and stamina. In the past, Amy didn't consider it a workout unless she was drenched in sweat. But that's no longer possible. Nor are the competitive tennis matches with John Paul.</p> <p>\"It's been a hard adjustment,\" Amy said. \"I had to shift my mentality a bit. It's about how much I can get done before my heart rate hits 160 bpm.\"</p> <p>One day, Dave Sauls, the paramedic, received a Facebook message from John Paul.</p> <p>Dave had heard Amy died. So, of course, he was \"flabbergasted\" by the message that said she was recovering at home.</p> <p>\"It was a gift from God in my life and something I needed at the time,\" he said. \"I sat there and cried.\"</p> <p>Since then, Dave and Amy have become close friends. He has trained many of her friends in CPR. </p> <p>Eager to raise awareness about women's heart health in general and SCAD specifically, Amy has recorded local public service announcements and attended fundraising walks.</p> <p>\"I look at it as my responsibility to warn other women that this can happen to anybody,\" Amy said. \"I didn't believe that it could happen to me, and my stubbornness almost cost my kids their mother.\"</p> <p>While it still stings that somebody else bought the home decor and art-making franchise that Amy wanted to buy into, she continues to make and sell her own pieces. She uses the name Heartwood, which her children suggested.</p> <p>\"This,\" she said, \"is my therapy.\" </p>",

Of those, 668 children had autism spectrum disorder (ASD); 914 had developmental delays; and a control group of 884 children had neither.</p><p>Compared to the control group, the risk of being overweight or obese was 1.57 times higher among children with autism and 1.38 times higher among those with developmental delays.</p><p>Children with severe autism symptoms were most likely to be overweight or obese. Their risk was 1.7 times higher than those with mild autism, according to the study.</p><p>\"These findings make it clear that monitoring these children for excess weight gain at an early age is critical, and that prevention efforts should be expanded to include not just children with ASD, but those with other developmental diagnoses, as well,\" said study lead author Dr. Susan Levy. She is medical director of the Center for Autism Research at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.</p><p>\"We need more research to understand why these children are more likely to develop obesity, and which children are at the highest risk,\" Levy said in a hospital news release.</p><p>However, the study only found an association between autism, developmental delays and obesity risk, not cause-and-effect. </p><p>Other medical factors that are common among children with autism may play a role, the researchers said.</p><p>These include endocrine and genetic disorders, gastrointestinal symptoms, medication side effects, sleep disturbances and rigid food choices.</p><p>The study authors suggested that health care providers should monitor children with autism or developmental delays for signs of excess weight gain and advise parents on how to prevent obesity. Parents whose kids show signs of excess weight gain should consult their health care provider, the researchers recommended. </p><p>The study was published online recently in <i>The Journal of Pediatrics</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Autism Society has more on <a href=\"http://www.autism-society.org/what-is/\" target=\"_new\">autism</a>.</p>",

She is an associate professor of psychology at the University of Arizona.</p><p>Edgin and her colleagues assessed 25 children with Down syndrome, average age 4.5 years, and 24 typically developing children, average age 2.5 years.</p><p>The researchers tested the children's ability to remember new words 5 minutes after they'd learned the words. The children were then tested again 4 hours after they'd learned the words and stayed awake, 4 hours after they'd learned the words and had a nap, and 24 hours later.</p><p>The typically developing children were more likely to remember the new words 4 hours and 24 hours after learning them if they took a 90-minute nap shortly after learning the word. </p><p>However, if the children with Down syndrome napped after learning the words, they were much less likely to remember them 4 hours and 24 hours later than if they didn't nap, the findings showed.</p><p>The study was published Oct. 29 in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>.</p><p>Further research is needed to learn why naps may harm learning in children with Down syndrome, said Edgin, who noted that REM sleep is reduced in people with Down syndrome. REM is a normal stage of sleep that is characterized by rapid eye movements, more dreaming and bodily movement, and faster pulse and breathing. </p><p>\"There might be something about getting too little REM sleep and not completing that REM stage that could be related to difficulties with retention,\" Edgin said in a university news release. </p><p>\"There are some recent studies that suggest that people show poorer retention if they get just a little bit of REM than if they get a whole REM cycle,\" she explained. \"More work needs to be done, but REM sleep is definitely something to consider.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The National Down Syndrome Society has more on <a href=\"https://www.ndss.org/\" target=\"_new\">Down syndrome</a>.</p>",

But there are safety precautions to take when you leave a protected indoor environment.</p><p>The Road Runners Club of America has a wealth of advice.</p><p>For starters, take some precautions before you leave home. First, tell loved ones where you'll be running. Next, in addition to taking ID with you, write your name, phone number and blood type (in case of an accident) inside one of your running shoes. Also, carry your cellphone.</p><p>\"There's safety in numbers\" is an old expression that still holds true. Steer clear of unpopulated areas, deserted or unlit streets, even overgrown trails. Trust your intuition -- if a situation just doesn't feel right, stay away from it. Also get in the habit of varying your running pattern, but do run in familiar areas.</p><p>While it's easy to lose yourself in your thoughts or music, stay alert. That means skipping the headphones. You want both your eyes and ears attuned to your environment.</p><p>Whether you run on city streets or country roads, go against the flow of traffic so you can see oncoming vehicles and they can see you. This should allow you to react more quickly to a problem.</p><p>Remember mom's lessons about crossing streets -- look both ways at all intersections. Do obey traffic signals, and don't blindly assume that drivers will see you or that they'll stop for you, especially those turning into your path.</p><p>If you want to go running while traveling, ask the local running club or running store for safe routes. Stick to areas with open businesses in case of an emergency and, of course, follow all the safety steps you would at home.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more <a href=\"https://www.rrca.org/education/rrca-general-running-safety-tips\" target=\"_new\">safety tips</a> check out the website of the Road Runners Club of America.</p>",

But exercise is an essential part of an overall treatment plan to ease RA symptoms and improve mobility. Aim for a weekly routine that includes stretching, cardio and strength training.</p><p>Stretching boosts flexibility and range of motion. First, warm muscles with 5 minutes of light movement, then do a series of stretches to target all muscle groups. Always hold each stretch for 20 seconds. Yoga and tai chi are specific activities that increase flexibility and may even help ease the emotional stress of RA. To learn the basics, take a class or work one-on-one with an instructor, at least at first.</p><p>You can get the benefits of cardio with low-impact exercises, which are easier on your joints than a pounding activity like running. Walking is great, but swimming and water workouts put even less stress on joints because of the buoyancy of the water.</p><p>Support your joints by strengthening the muscles around them with resistance exercises. You can use stretchy resistance bands if weights are too hard to manage. Pay special attention to the muscles surrounding the joints most affected by rheumatoid arthritis, but don't neglect other muscle groups.</p><p>Work with your rheumatologist or a physical therapist familiar with RA to develop an individualized plan and ask how you should tailor your activities when a flare strikes.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Arthritis Foundation has more tips to help you find <a href=\"http://www.arthritis.org/about-arthritis/types/rheumatoid-arthritis/articles/best-exercises-for-ra.php\" target=\"_new\">the best exercises</a> when you have RA.</p>",

But exercise is an essential part of an overall treatment plan to ease RA symptoms and improve mobility. Aim for a weekly routine that includes stretching, cardio and strength training.</p><p>Stretching boosts flexibility and range of motion. First, warm muscles with 5 minutes of light movement, then do a series of stretches to target all muscle groups. Always hold each stretch for 20 seconds. Yoga and tai chi are specific activities that increase flexibility and may even help ease the emotional stress of RA. To learn the basics, take a class or work one-on-one with an instructor, at least at first.</p><p>You can get the benefits of cardio with low-impact exercises, which are easier on your joints than a pounding activity like running. Walking is great, but swimming and water workouts put even less stress on joints because of the buoyancy of the water.</p><p>Support your joints by strengthening the muscles around them with resistance exercises. You can use stretchy resistance bands if weights are too hard to manage. Pay special attention to the muscles surrounding the joints most affected by rheumatoid arthritis, but don't neglect other muscle groups.</p><p>Work with your rheumatologist or a physical therapist familiar with RA to develop an individualized plan and ask how you should tailor your activities when a flare strikes.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Arthritis Foundation has more tips to help you find <a href=\"http://www.arthritis.org/about-arthritis/types/rheumatoid-arthritis/articles/best-exercises-for-ra.php\" target=\"_new\">the best exercises</a> when you have RA.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Feb. 1, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Instead of popping a painkiller, a little mindful yoga might go a long way toward easing longstanding pain, a new study suggests.</p><p>The review of 21 clinical trials involving nearly 2,000 people looked at the effects of two drug-free options for chronic pain: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and a program called mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). It combines meditation and gentle yoga postures.</p><p>In general, patients fared better with either therapy than with no treatment or with standard care, including pain medication.</p><p>Experts said the results point to the value of drug-free alternatives for dealing with chronic pain. That's especially important in the context of the current opioid crisis, said Dr. Muhammad Hassan Majeed, a psychiatrist at Natchaug Hospital in Mansfield Center, Conn.</p><p>For chronic pain that is unrelated to cancer, he said, opioids do not work well. Plus, they carry risks of addiction, overdose and even death.</p><p>Majeed, who was not involved in the new report, has published his own reviews of the evidence for mindfulness and other non-drug approaches for chronic pain.</p><p>The bottom line, he said, is that there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" treatment. Instead, there is a range of potentially effective options that people can try.</p><p>\"Medication is not the only one,\" Majeed said.</p><p>That's not a controversial message. Guidelines for managing chronic pain -- from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other groups -- already discourage doctors from prescribing opioids for most people. They also stress that non-drug choices -- from physical therapy to psychological approaches like CBT -- should be among the \"preferred options.\"</p><p>Why would psychological therapies help? Because chronic pain is not purely physical, Majeed said. There is an emotional component, he explained, and the ways people perceive and respond to their pain are crucial.</p><p>CBT helps people change their habitual thought patterns and reactions around their pain, according to Majeed. Mindfulness practices, like meditation, have a similar goal: The typical definition of mindfulness is to focus on what's happening in the moment, rather than letting the mind spin off.</p><p>Right now, CBT is the most widely used psychological approach to treating chronic pain, said Wei Cheng, one of the researchers on the review.</p><p>Only one study in the review directly compared CBT with mindfulness-based stress reduction. So it's not clear whether mindfulness is as effective as CBT, said Cheng, of the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Ontario, Canada.</p><p>But, he added, not everyone who tries CBT for chronic pain finds it helpful. Mindful practices offer \"an alternative and potentially helpful approach,\" he said.</p><p>The review, published Jan. 31 in <i>Evidence Based Mental Health</i>, pulled together 21 clinical trials. Thirteen compared CBT against a \"control\" -- either no treatment or standard therapies like pain medication. In each study, CBT patients had eight to 12 group sessions with a therapist.</p><p>In seven trials, patients were randomly assigned to either MBSR or a control group. MBSR involved eight to 12 weekly sessions with a therapist trained in the program -- along with 45 minutes of daily home practice.</p><p>The patients had long-standing pain from conditions like arthritis, fibromyalgia and temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ), which affects the jaw. A few trials focused on chronic low back pain.</p><p>Overall, Cheng's team found, patients who received either CBT or MBSR typically fared better than the control group. They reported more improvements in pain intensity, physical functioning and depression symptoms.</p><p>On average, those effects were \"small,\" however, the researchers noted.</p><p>But that's to be expected, according to Majeed. He said patients vary widely in how much relief they get from CBT or mindfulness -- in part, because of the motivation it takes to incorporate what they learn into daily life.</p><p>Plus, Majeed said, while these approaches can help people manage their pain and \"feel better,\" they won't erase the pain.</p><p>For any one person, the choice of whether to try CBT or MBSR will partly depend on personal preferences, according to Majeed. But there are also practical matters, he added, including availability of therapists and insurance coverage.</p><p>MBSR is a specific program. But its components -- mindfulness meditation and gentle yoga -- are available in many formats.</p><p>An important thing to keep in mind, Majeed noted, is that these approaches do not produce instant relief.</p><p>\"It takes time to heal, and to adopt a new lifestyle,\" he said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health has more on <a href=\"https://nccih.nih.gov/health/pain/consumer\" target=\"_new\">pain treatment</a>.</p>",

            "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 29, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The hearts of women who snore appear to become damaged more quickly than those of men who \"saw lumber\" at night, a new study suggests.</p><p>Evaluating nearly 4,500 British adults who underwent cardiac imaging, researchers also learned that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may be vastly underdiagnosed among snorers.</p><p>This finding surprised study author Dr. Adrian Curta, who heads  cardiac imaging at Munich University Hospital in Germany.</p><p>\"A further surprise was the different manifestation of disease according to gender,\" Curta said. \"Females show different alterations in cardiac [measures]. A possible reason for this could be that women with OSA are more vulnerable to cardiac alterations.\"</p> <p>Loud snoring is a hallmark of obstructive sleep apnea, which affects between 3 percent and 7 percent of adults in the United States, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Also characterized by brief periods where breathing stops, often followed by gasping for air, sleep apnea is becoming recognized as a contributor to serious health conditions, such as high blood pressure, heart disease and poor blood sugar metabolism.</p><p>Sleep apnea treatment depends on the cause. Treatments include surgery to open narrowed upper airways or using a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine while sleeping.</p><p>Curta and his colleagues evaluated data from the UK Biobank, which follows the health and well-being of 500,000 volunteers. The researchers  looked at data from nearly 4,500 participants who underwent cardiac imaging. These study volunteers were split into three groups: 38 with obstructive sleep apnea; 1,919 who reported snoring; and 2,536 without OSA or snoring.</p><p>In both men and women, those with sleep apnea and snoring tended to have larger left ventricles of the heart, meaning the walls were enlarged and the heart was working harder to pump, Curta said.</p><p>But when the snoring group was compared to the unaffected group, a more significant difference was found in the size of the left ventricle among women compared to men. These cardiac changes in self-reported snorers suggest earlier heart impairment in women and could point to undiagnosed sleep apnea, he said.</p> <p>The findings suggest the transition from snoring to obstructive sleep apnea is an evolving process linked to a potentially dangerous enlargement of the left ventricle. But the research did not prove that sleep apnea causes heart changes, only that an association exists between the two.</p><p>Curta noted that researchers are still uncertain why snoring would remodel women's hearts more quickly than men's. More research needs to be done to understand this process, he said.</p><p>\"The most important clinical implication is that we need better prevention for OSA, such as a broader information program,\" Curta said. \"Individuals with snoring should ask someone to observe them during sleep if they show periods of breathing cessation.\"</p><p>Those who do stop breathing while sleeping should undergo a sleep study to determine how advanced their sleep apnea is and the proper treatment, Curta said.</p><p>Dr. Tetyana Kendzerska is a sleep physician at Ottawa Hospital Sleep Center in Canada, and wasn't involved in the new research. Since obesity is a known contributor to snoring and sleep apnea, Kendzerska said losing excess weight is encouraged for those with snoring or sleep apnea.</p> <p>\"We know that men and women report different symptoms for OSA, and as a result, obstructive sleep apnea is seriously underreported and underdiagnosed in women,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Given that potential cardiovascular risk associated with sleep apnea may be greater in women than in men, first we need to identify women with sleep apnea [by] increasing awareness among health care professionals,\" Kendzerska added.</p> <p>The research was to be presented Thursday at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America, in Chicago. Research presented at meetings typically hasn't been peer-reviewed or published, and results are considered preliminary.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more on <a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Sleep-Apnea-Information-Page\" target=\"_new\">sleep apnea</a>.</p>",
