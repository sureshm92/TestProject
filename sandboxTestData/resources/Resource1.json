The study included hundreds of participants, either with autism or without the disorder.</p><p>The autism group had prolonged connectivity (up to 20 seconds) between brain areas, while those links faded much more quickly in people without autism, the findings showed.</p><p>The researchers also found that the autism symptoms increased with the duration of connectivity between brain regions.</p><p>\"This is a whole new perspective into how autism works in the brain, and can help us develop strategies for treatment and finding medications that might be more effective to ease the symptoms of the disorder,\" Anderson said in a university news release.</p><p>One in every 59 children in the United States has an autism spectrum disorder, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They typically have difficulty with communication, repetitive behaviors and socializing. Symptoms may range from mild to severe.</p><p>According to study first author Jace King, the findings provide researchers \"with new tools to figure out the mechanisms that may underlie autism.\" King is  a postdoctoral research associate in the university's Brain Network Lab.</p><p>But Anderson said the team first needs to validate the results from this analysis in other groups of people. </p><p>The study was published online recently in <i>JAMA Network Open</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\" https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/index.html \" target=\"_new\">autism</a>.</p>",

This could help reduce the spread of the disease, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.</p><p>Called a \"point-of-care\" test, the screening gives accurate results 93 percent of the time for a positive result and 99 percent of the time for a negative result, the investigators found. The study was funded by the U.S. National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB).</p><p>\"Point-of-care tests for STDs are making significant progress towards being highly sensitive, specific and easy to read within a short wait time,\" Tiffani Bailey Lash said in an institute news release. She is director of NIBIB programs in point-of-care technologies. </p><p>Study leader Charlotte Gaydos said the goal of point-of-care technology is to deliver quick results and give patients more options. </p><p>\"A patient should be able to choose if he/she comes into a clinic, goes to a pharmacy, or takes a test at home for STD diagnosis; the bottom line is to encourage people to get tested,\" said Gaydos, a professor of infectious diseases.</p><p>People with STDs often don't have obvious symptoms, which means they can unknowingly spread the diseases. Currently, patients wait two to 14 days for STD test results, and those who have been tested have low rates of return to receive results, counseling and treatment.</p><p>Women with untreated chlamydia can develop pelvic inflammatory disease. In men, untreated chlamydia can cause urethral infection and complications such as swollen and tender testicles.</p><p>The Johns Hopkins team is collaborating on a clinical trial that could lead to the approval of a chlamydia and gonorrhea point-of-care test in the United States.</p><p>The need is urgent, the researchers said.

However, one aspect of recordkeeping -- how often to get on the scale -- has been the subject of much debate.</p><p>Daily weigh-ins used to be thought of as negative, capable of discouraging you if the pounds didn't come off fast enough, or if day-to-day fluctuations were frustrating. But more recent research has found that it can be a powerful motivator.</p><p>While there's a lot more to dropping pounds than just getting on the scale, weighing yourself can be an important part of the plan. One study found participants achieved weight loss success with daily self-monitoring that included a weigh-in, counting steps and recording fruit, vegetable and water intake.</p><p>Stepping on the scale every day can also help you avoid the natural tendency to gain weight as you age by alerting you early on should pounds sneak on, enabling you to adjust your calorie intake. And, equally important, it plays a role in maintaining weight loss.</p><p>Surveys show that people who successfully keep weight off are more likely to weigh themselves frequently as part of their maintenance plan. The scale in essence functions as an early warning detection system, showing you if your weight starts to creep up.</p><p>The problem is that, over time, people lose interest in tracking their weight, said University of Pittsburgh researchers who followed a group of dieters for a year and a half. Even though weigh-ins helped with weight loss over the first 6 months, adherence to using the scale progressively declined over the following year.</p><p>The answer is to make getting on the scale as much of a habit as brushing your teeth, and to log your weight every day, whether you use your computer, smartphone or an old-school paper record.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Consumer Reports has more tips on <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/scales/the-best-time-to-weigh-yourself/\" target=\"_new\">the best ways to weigh yourself</a> for accuracy and motivation.</p>",

But there is evidence that it helps stabilize the lives of some people who use heroin,\" Kilmer said in a RAND news release.</p><p>Specifically, these are people unable to quit heroin after trying traditional treatments such as methadone and buprenorphine, the researchers said.</p><p>To assess the effectiveness of heroin-assisted treatment, the researchers examined evidence from Canada, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.</p><p>They found that prescribing heroin injections under medical observation -- with optional take-home methadone -- has advantages over methadone alone for addicts who have repeatedly tried traditional addiction treatments without success.</p><p>While the top priority should be increasing access to traditional treatments, the severity of the U.S. opioid crisis requires other approaches to saving lives, according to the study authors.</p><p>Opioid addiction affects about 9 out of every 1,000 Americans and opioid overdose deaths have quadrupled over the past 15 years. More than 49,000 people died from opioid overdoses in the United States in 2017, the researchers said in background notes.</p><p>Kilmer and his colleagues also assessed safe injection sites in those other countries -- places where addicts can inject drugs purchased on the street.

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 2, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Creating art and tackling do-it-yourself projects are soothing pastimes for many people, and 37-year-old Amy Cavaliere is one of them.</p><p>The mother of three from Royersford, Pennsylvania -- about a half hour from Philadelphia -- enjoys making pallet wall art that combines hand-stenciled words and imagery on stained wood. In fact, she was planning to franchise a popular workshop that offers classes devoted to the activity.</p> <p>\"You go in with friends, drink wine and make a custom piece of wooden pallet art for your home decor,\" she said. \"It's fun.\" Unfortunately, fate had other plans.</p> <p>One morning in February 2017, while getting her children ready for school, Amy felt a heavy sensation in her chest. Her arms began to ache so badly that she couldn't finish brushing her daughter's hair. Within minutes, her skin turned pale and she started to hyperventilate. </p> <p>Although Amy had never experienced a panic attack, that was her best guess about what was happening. </p> <p>\"What else could it be?\" she said. After all, she was young, healthy and active, regularly participating in spinning classes and playing competitive tennis matches against her husband, John Paul.</p> <p>Admittedly stubborn by nature, Amy was adamant that John Paul not dial 911. He did it anyway. Her stubborn streak continued when the paramedics arrived. She insisted upon walking to the ambulance. As paramedics checked her vital signs, she tried to convince them that she was fine. </p> <p>Then her heart stopped.</p> <p>As the ambulance sped to the hospital, paramedic Dave Sauls performed CPR. \"I kept expecting her to come out of it,\" he said, \"but it wasn't happening.\"</p> <p>At the emergency room, the nurses took over chest compressions and continued to perform CPR and AED shocks for nearly 45 minutes.</p> <p>An angiogram revealed a 100 percent blockage of her left anterior descending artery. This type of heart attack is commonly known as the widow maker. Worse yet, the blockage was caused by spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), meaning a tear in the artery wall.</p> <p>SCAD is a rare event that occurs mostly in women (about 80 percent), with an average age younger than 50. Other disorders are believed to make people more likely to suffer SCAD. One of them is a disease of the blood vessels called fibromuscular dysplasia, which Amy was later diagnosed with having. </p> <p>At her local hospital, doctors decided she needed more specialized help than they could provide.</p> <p>Amy spent nine days in a medically induced coma. Once she awoke, she saw John Paul sitting at the foot of her hospital bed. She had no idea of what had happened. </p> <p>After the sedatives and other medications left her system, Amy felt so wired she couldn't sleep a wink for two straight days (\"my eyes were like saucers,\" she said). Watching the clock tick away hour by hour, she was terrified she could experience another heart attack at any moment. Any sort of chest pain causes her anxiety to this day.</p> <p>\"Since I don't remember what it felt like, I don't have a frame of reference,\" she said. \"It's terrifying -- the inner turmoil of a cardiac patient.\"</p> <p>After 21 days in the hospital, and surviving bouts of double pneumonia and a narrowing of her trachea, Amy was released. It took more than a year for her to start feeling like herself again.</p> <p>Although her heart function is permanently compromised, she is working to build strength and stamina. In the past, Amy didn't consider it a workout unless she was drenched in sweat. But that's no longer possible. Nor are the competitive tennis matches with John Paul.</p> <p>\"It's been a hard adjustment,\" Amy said. \"I had to shift my mentality a bit. It's about how much I can get done before my heart rate hits 160 bpm.\"</p> <p>One day, Dave Sauls, the paramedic, received a Facebook message from John Paul.</p> <p>Dave had heard Amy died. So, of course, he was \"flabbergasted\" by the message that said she was recovering at home.</p> <p>\"It was a gift from God in my life and something I needed at the time,\" he said. \"I sat there and cried.\"</p> <p>Since then, Dave and Amy have become close friends. He has trained many of her friends in CPR. </p> <p>Eager to raise awareness about women's heart health in general and SCAD specifically, Amy has recorded local public service announcements and attended fundraising walks.</p> <p>\"I look at it as my responsibility to warn other women that this can happen to anybody,\" Amy said. \"I didn't believe that it could happen to me, and my stubbornness almost cost my kids their mother.\"</p> <p>While it still stings that somebody else bought the home decor and art-making franchise that Amy wanted to buy into, she continues to make and sell her own pieces. She uses the name Heartwood, which her children suggested.</p> <p>\"This,\" she said, \"is my therapy.\" </p>",

It can take weeks for the redness and crusting to disappear following strong re-surfacing procedures that remove damaged top layers of skin. But they don't involve the surgery and lengthier recovery of facelifts and eyelifts, for instance. And in fact, fewer and fewer of those procedures are being done.</p><p>With the easy accessibility of peels and injections, people at younger and younger ages are starting to avail themselves of these treatments, even before they have a real need for them.</p><p>Experts warn not to start too soon -- overly plumped lips and a frozen forehead can actually make you look older than you are. They recommend more emphasis on caring for skin from an early age to prevent or delay the need for procedures in the future.</p><p>If you're considering having some work done, have a candid conversation with a dermatologist or plastic surgeon to determine which, if any, procedures are right for you, along with realistic expectations of what can be achieved.</p><p>Remember that these are all true medical procedures that should be performed in a controlled environment by highly trained healthcare providers.

But one health expert suggests that these folks can still enjoy festive gatherings, as long as they take certain precautions.</p><p>About 5 percent of children and 4 percent of adults in the United States have a food allergy, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. The most common allergens are milk, egg, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish and shellfish.</p><p>\"It's important for people to remember that even though the main ingredients in a dish may be fine, some ingredients can be hidden and cause allergic reactions,\" said Dr. Russell Traister. He is an allergist and immunologist at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C.</p><p>People with food allergies need to be aware of cross-contamination. For example, peanut protein can remain on a bowl or work surface for up to five hours and still cause a severe reaction for someone with a peanut allergy.</p><p>In addition, people with food allergies should always have an EpiPen or the generic version of the epinephrine auto-injector with them. They should make sure it has not expired, and that friends and family members know how to use it, Traister said.</p><p>If you're attending a holiday gathering with a child or other family member who has food allergies, bring at least one dish that's safe for them in case there aren't any other options, he said.</p><p>If you're hosting a get-together, keep all prepared food packaging so guests can check the ingredients for any potential allergens.</p><p>Food allergy symptoms can range from rashes, coughing and vomiting to potentially life-threatening reactions, such as swelling of the tongue and the inability to breathe.</p><p>\"If you think you or a friend or family member is having an allergic reaction and you don't have an epinephrine auto-injector with you, call 911 immediately or go to the closest emergency department,\" Traister said in a Wake Forest news release.</p><p>\"Even if you use your epinephrine auto-injector, you should still seek medical attention to prevent a second reaction,\" he added.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians has more on <a href=\"https://familydoctor.org/condition/food-allergies/?adfree=true\" target=\"_new\">food allergies</a>.</p>",

For this study, they wanted to see if variables such as sex, breed, size or number of dogs affected the risk of asthma and allergy during a child's first year of life.</p><p>Researcher Tove Fall of Uppsala University in Sweden led the study. She's a senior lecturer in the department of medical sciences.</p><p>\"The sex of the dog can affect the amount of allergens released, and we know that uncastrated male dogs express more of a particular allergen than castrated dogs and female dogs,\" Fall said. \"Moreover, some breeds are described anecdotally as 'hypoallergenic' or 'allergy friendly' and are said to be more suitable for people with allergies, but there is no scientific evidence for this.\"</p><p>For the study, the researchers collected data on 23,600 children, born in Sweden between 2001 and 2004, who had a dog in their home for the first year of life. The investigators linked that information with two dog owner registries that classified dogs by sex, breed, number, size and claimed \"hypoallergenicity.\" </p><p>The researchers then compared the dogs' characteristics to the risk of asthma and allergies or the prescription of asthma or allergy drugs for children at age 6. They took into account known factors that could affect risk, including parental asthma and allergy, geographical location and number of siblings.</p><p>The analysis revealed that 5.4 percent of 6-year-olds had asthma. And children who had female dogs had a 16 percent lower risk than those with male dogs.</p><p>But living with a male dog did not put kids at higher risk  than having no dog at all, the findings showed. And children in families with two or more dogs had a 21 percent lower risk of asthma than those with just one.</p><p>Kids whose parents themselves have asthma or allergies more often had dogs described as \"hypoallergenic\" than did other children (12 percent versus 8 percent), according to the report. </p><p>Exposure to these breeds was tied to a 27 percent higher risk of allergy, but no increased risk for asthma.</p><p>Study co-author Catarina Almqvist Malmros is a professor in the department of medical epidemiology and biostatistics at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.</p><p>Malmros cautioned that the study findings can't prove that certain breeds cause asthma or allergies, only that there is an association. </p><p>\"The likely explanation for this higher risk is that families with a history of allergy to furred pets more often choose these dogs, and also that 'allergy-friendly' dogs do not in fact release less allergens,\" she said in a university news release. </p><p>The report was published online Nov. 15 in the journal <i>Scientific Reports</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>To learn more about asthma, visit the <a href=\"https://www.aaaai.org/conditions-and-treatments/asthma\" target=\"_new\"> American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology</a>.</p>",

But new research suggests you can take steps to protect yourself when dining out.</p><p>In fact, the more steps you take to protect yourself from exposure to the allergic substance, the less likely you are to have an allergic reaction, the study found.</p><p>The researchers asked 39 people with allergies (or their parents) about 25 behaviors people might do before eating out. Nineteen of those surveyed had experienced a food allergy reaction while dining at a restaurant.</p><p>\"Overall, when you look at the results and the strategies that people used, people who had an allergic reaction [after eating out] used significantly less strategies compared to non-reactors. Non-reactors used an average of 15 strategies, reactors used an average of six,\" said study author Dr. Justine Ade, a pediatric resident at University Hospitals' Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland.</p><p>Up to 15 million people may have food allergies, according to the nonprofit organization FARE (Food Allergy and Research Education). Although 170 foods have been reported to cause allergic reactions, there are eight common foods that cause allergies in the United States: milk, egg, peanut, tree nuts, wheat, soy, fish and shellfish. FARE reports that sesame allergy is also a growing threat. </p><p>Eating food outside the home has been linked to numerous deaths in people with food allergies, according to the researchers. </p><p>Although the study didn't evaluate how well any particular strategy worked, it did note how often people used individual strategies. </p><p>The top five strategies people used included: </p><ul><li>Speaking to the waiter on arrival (80 percent),</li><li>Ordering food with simple ingredients (77 percent), </li><li>Double-checking food before eating (77 percent), </li><li>Avoiding restaurants with higher likelihood of contamination (74 percent),</li><li>Reviewing ingredients on a restaurant website (72 percent).</li></ul><p>The strategies used least often included:</p><ul><li>Placing food allergy order separately (23 percent), </li><li>Using a personal allergy card (26 percent),</li><li>No longer eating at restaurants (39 percent), </li><li>Choosing a chain restaurant (41 percent),</li><li>Going to a restaurant during off-peak hours (44 percent).</li></ul><p>Ade said it may sound like a lot of work just to eat out, but \"these are things that become second nature for some people, and it probably takes less than five minutes to do most of these things.\"</p><p>People with food allergies aren't the only ones who worry about what's on their restaurant plate. Alice Bast, CEO of Beyond Celiac, a nonprofit health and awareness group, said that every time someone with celiac disease eats out, they play \"gluten roulette.\" </p><p>Celiac disease is a digestive disorder, and symptoms are triggered when someone with the disease eats gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. </p><p>\"Dining out is one of the biggest challenges of living with celiac disease,\" Bast said. \"When you're out of control of your food, it's easy to feel anxious about the possibility of becoming sick. There are always risks when someone else is preparing your meal, especially if they don't take it seriously, or if they are just unaware of how to take the appropriate precautions.\" </p><p>Both experts said it's important to be vigilant and take the steps that you can to make sure your food is as safe as it can be. In the case of food allergies, Ade said it's important to carry an epinephrine injection pen every time you eat out. </p><p>Ade will present the findings on Friday at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology annual meeting, in Seattle. Research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>FARE (Food Allergy and Research Education) offers more about <a href=\"https://www.foodallergy.org/life-with-food-allergies/managing-lifes-milestones/dining-out\" target=\"_new\">dining out with food allergies</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 16, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- A study that tracked the weight and survival of more than 6,000 Americans for 24 years reinforces the notion that piling on excess pounds can lead to an earlier grave.</p><p>Being statistically obese, but not simply overweight, was tied to a 27 percent increase in the odds of dying within the study period, according to a research team from Boston University.</p><p>People in the \"obese\" category had a body mass index (BMI) between 30 and 34, with 30 being the statistical threshold for obesity. For example, a 5-foot 4-inch person weighing 175 pounds has a BMI of 30.</p><p>The risk of dying young was also higher for \"very\" obese people -- those with a BMI of 35 to 39.  People in this weight category had nearly double the odds of dying during the 24-year study period compared to people with a normal weight, said biostatistician Ching-Ti Liu and colleagues.</p><p>The study was unique, Liu's team believes, because it wasn't based on a person's BMI at one point in the life span, but instead tracked people's \"weight history\" over time. That should \"improve the accuracy of BMI data and thus lead to better estimates of the association between obesity and mortality,\" the study authors reported.</p><p>The approach did turn up one finding that may be heartening to people fighting the \"battle of the bulge\": Being overweight, but not past the BMI 30 threshold for obesity, did not seem to affect life span.</p><p>The study found that overweight people could expect roughly the same survival odds as those in the normal-weight category.</p><p>\"There was no difference in mortality risk for those who remained overweight and those who remained normal weight,\" noted Mark Pereira, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota. That could be because healthy lifestyle changes can stave off disease, even in overweight people, he suggested in a commentary accompanying the new study.</p><p>Prior studies \"have clearly shown that decreases in disease incidence are possible through improved diet and physical activity among overweight and obese individuals, whether weight loss is achieved or not,\" he added.</p><p>The Boston University study relied on detailed information collected every few years on the weight of nearly 6,200 adult participants in the ongoing Framingham Heart Study, with records stretching back over 24 years.</p><p>Overall, more than half (56 percent) of the study group had died by the end of 2014. Being obese or very obese seemed to have a significant impact on whether death arrived relatively early, Liu's team found.</p><p>Because smoking could confound the results, his team also ran the numbers  for only those 3,075 participants who had never smoked.</p>  <p>The trends appeared to be even stronger in the absence of smoking, the findings showed.</p><p>In this group, being obese was tied to 31 percent higher odds of death during the study period, while being very obese bumped up the risk to nearly 2.4 times that of normal-weight never-smokers.</p> <p>Surprisingly, in the \"never-smokers\" group, being overweight (but not obese)  <i>did</i> seem to have an effect in lowering life span, relative to normal-weight people.</p><p>Overall, all of these effects seemed more profound in men than in women, the researchers said.</p><p>There was one more intriguing finding:  The impact  obesity has on survival seems to have eased over the past few decades.</p><p>According to the Liu's team, that may be due to better \"risk factor control\" -- healthy lifestyle changes -- or improvements in drug therapy (statins, for example), surgeries such as angioplasties or bypass, and hospital care.</p><p>All of those advances may be keeping obese Americans alive longer than in decades past, the researchers said.</p><p>Still, Pereira wrote, \"the bottom line from these analyses was that the lowest mortality risk was observed among individuals who remained in the normal weight or overweight categories over time,\" and never became obese.</p><p>Doing so may be becoming tougher, he added, since \"to be overweight or mildly obese today, relative to four or more decades ago, appears to be the new normal.\"</p><p>That doesn't mean obese Americans are helpless to improve their health, however. According to Pereira, the study supports \"lifestyle and environment changes to prevent chronic diseases and mortality among overweight and obese individuals.\"</p><p>The study was published online Nov. 16 in <i>JAMA Network Open</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on maintaining a healthy weight at the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/losing-weight\" target=\"_new\">American Heart Association</a>.</p>",

He is a nutrition researcher at  Harvard School of Public Health in Boston.</p><p>The new study was published Nov. 21 in the <i>BMJ</i>.</p><p>The researchers noted that previous studies have shown smoking, a poor diet, inactivity, and being overweight/obese increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. Shift work has also been linked with an increased risk, the investigators added in a journal news release.</p><p>But the authors said  they believe this is the first study to examine the combined effect of an unhealthy lifestyle and shift work on type 2 diabetes risk. The results show it's especially important for shift workers to follow a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>The researchers analyzed data from more than 143,000 U.S. women who did not have type 2 diabetes, heart disease or cancer when they enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and NHS II in 1976 and 1989.</p><p>Over 22 to 24 years of follow-up, nearly 11,000 of the women were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. For every five years of working rotating night shifts, there was a 31 percent higher risk of a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. </p><p>Each unhealthy lifestyle factor -- ever smoking, being overweight or obese, having a poor diet, being inactive -- was linked with a 2.3 times higher risk of being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The study authors explained that a poor diet was low in fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains, and high in processed meat, trans fats, sugar and salt.</p><p>Women who had any of the four unhealthy lifestyle factors and also worked rotating night shifts had the highest risk of developing type 2 diabetes, the findings showed. Among this group, each individual unhealthy lifestyle factor was associated with a 2.8 times increased risk.</p><p>This suggests that some kind of interaction between rotating night shifts and an unhealthy lifestyle factor adds further risk, according to the authors. In this study, rotating night shifts were defined as working at least three night shifts a month, in addition to day and evening shifts that month.</p><p>The researchers concluded that rotating night-shift work accounted for about 17 percent of the combined higher risk of type 2 diabetes, unhealthy lifestyle accounted for about 71 percent, and the remaining 11 percent was additional risk associated with the interaction of the two.</p><p>According to the report, the increased risk of type 2 diabetes among rotating night-shift workers with an unhealthy lifestyle may be due to disrupted sleep and body-clock rhythms affecting hormones, other metabolic pathways or the balance of bacteria in the gut.</p><p>Because this was an observational study, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. Also, since all of the nurses were female and mostly white, the findings may not apply to men and other racial or ethnic groups, the researchers noted.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases has more on <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/preventing-type-2-diabetes\" target=\"_new\">type 2 diabetes prevention</a>.</p>",

In addition, addicted women may not tell their doctors about their drug use for fear of the legal consequences, Admon noted.</p><p>Another women's health expert agreed with the findings.</p><p>\"This study confirms what I have been hearing clinically from providers and patients in the West that there is an unrecognized problem with amphetamines, and that the opioid crisis is now coupled with an amphetamine crisis that desperately needs monetary, treatment and recovery infrastructure support to reduce it,\" said Hendree Jones, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.</p><p>Furthermore, the study provides compelling data that underscores the lack of addiction treatment resources for women of childbearing age, said Jones, who wasn't involved with the research.</p><p>For the study, Admon and colleagues collected data on 47 million births in U.S. hospitals over 12 years. </p><p>They found that the number of births among women addicted to amphetamine, mostly methamphetamine, doubled from 2008 to 2015, from 1.2 per 1,000 births to 2.4 per 1,000 births.</p><p>In addition, opioid use more than quadrupled from 1.5 per 1,000 births between 2004 and 2005 to 6.5 per 1,000 between 2014 and 2015.  </p><p>Using amphetamine during pregnancy increases the odds of moms dying or having serious medical complications by nearly two times of that of women using opioids, the researchers found. </p><p>Also the risk of preterm delivery, preeclampsia or eclampsia, heart failure or heart attack, and the need for a blood transfusion were higher among moms using amphetamine, compared with those using opioids, according to the study. </p><p>The main risk to infants born to addicted mothers is neonatal abstinence syndrome. Basically, the infants are born addicted to the drug mom was using and they go through withdrawal, much as an adult does when they stop taking the drug.</p><p>Symptoms such as body shakes, tremors, breathing problems, diarrhea or throwing up and fever and sweating can last up to six months, according to the March of Dimes. </p><p>Often these babies need to be in neonatal intensive care units for an extended period.</p><p>Between 2014 and 2015, amphetamine use caused delivery complications in roughly 1 percent of all births in the rural West (11 per 1,000 deliveries), which was higher than the number of complications among women using opioids in most areas. </p><p>Opioid use during pregnancy was highest in rural areas of the Northeast, causing complications in nearly 3 percent of all births (29 per 1,000 deliveries).</p><p>Poor, white women on public assistance were the ones most likely to be using amphetamine and opioids, the researchers found.</p><p>In addition to using amphetamine and opioids,  many of these women are also using marijuana and tobacco, said Dr. Rahul Gupta, chief medical and health officer at the March of Dimes.</p><p>\"It's very troubling that of all the times in the lifecycle of an individual during pregnancy, women who are using opioids are also using tobacco,\" he said. \"That almost seals the fate of the infant, as well as the health of the mother and the ability of the mother to take care of the child,\" Gupta said.</p><p>The report was published Nov. 29 in the <i>American Journal of Public Health</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Pregnancy Association has more information on <a href=\"http://americanpregnancy.org/pregnancy-health/illegal-drugs-during-pregnancy/\" target=\"_new\">drug addiction and pregnancy</a>.</p>",

The women's average age was 37. The group included 23 women from the United Kingdom, seven from the United States, and one from Norway. </p><p>The most common reason for egg freezing was not having a partner or having a partner who wouldn't commit to fatherhood, the findings showed.</p><p>Some of the women said they wanted to relieve the pressure of trying to find a suitable partner. Many said they hoped never to have to use their frozen eggs because they would conceive naturally with a future partner. Several said that freezing their eggs was emotionally difficult because they wanted to become mothers with a committed partner.</p><p>The researchers also found that the information available to women considering freezing their eggs was inadequate. For example, nearly all of the women said the clinics they talked with couldn't provide an estimate of the chances of a live birth with the frozen eggs. There was also little in-depth discussion with doctors about processes and outcomes after egg freezing.</p><p>The study was published online Nov. 1 in the journal <i>Human Fertility</i>.</p><p>Growing numbers of women are considering egg freezing, so more needs to be done to fully inform and support those who have the procedure, according to the researchers.</p><p>\"Furthermore, women should be informed of the costs and risks, as well as the physical and emotional demands of egg freezing and any future [in vitro fertilization] treatment,\" Baldwin added in a journal news release.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on egg freezing at the <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Gynecologic-Practice/Oocyte-Cryopreservation\" target=\"_new\">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Dec. 19, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Dangerous infections, blinding ulcers in the eyes: These are just some of the troubles that can come from wearing your contacts for too long.</p><p>Contact lenses are generally considered safe, but wearing them while asleep significantly raises the risk of developing serious  complications that can cause permanent visual loss, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns.</p><p>In one instance, a 34-year-old man who both swam while wearing his contact lenses and wore them overnight three to four days a week developed a rare but potentially blinding form of keratitis caused by a microscopic organism.</p><p> Keratitis -- an inflammation of the cornea -- is responsible for an estimated one million outpatient and emergency department visits each year, according to the CDC.</p><p>Another case involved a teenage girl who developed a corneal ulcer and scarring after wearing unprescribed lenses to bed.</p><p>Yet another involved a 57-year-old man who nearly lost vision in one eye after wearing his soft lenses nonstop for two weeks without daily cleaning.</p><p>In that case, the patient ultimately required a corneal transplant in his right eye after suffering a bacterial infection and a perforated cornea.</p><p>\"The excess risks of developing corneal infection with overnight wear of contact lenses has been recognized for many years,\" explained Dr. Oliver Schein. He is a professor of ophthalmology, and vice-chair for quality and safety with the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Schein was not involved in the current case study report.</p><p>With an eye toward the 45 million Americans who regularly wear contacts, the CDC is highlighting the concern in collaboration with the Eye and Contact Lens Association and the disease surveillance network EMERGEncy ID NET.</p><p>Together, the organizations published a new report in the January issue of the <i>Annals of Emergency Medicine</i> that outlines the experiences of six patients who recently developed corneal infections after routinely wearing their contact lenses to bed. The report was led by Dr. Jon Femling of the University of New Mexico's School of Medicine.</p><p>Despite the introduction of silicone hydrogels in the 1990s, overall corneal infection risk has held steady over decades, Schein said, affecting about one in every 2,500 lens wearers.</p><p>But that risk is \"at least 10-fold greater for those choosing to sleep with lenses in. So I discourage that practice whenever I can,\" he added.</p><p>As to why the risk is greater, Schein cited a number of factors that \"favor microbial [germ] growth\" whenever the eyes are closed, including \"microtrauma to the surface of the cornea,\" a drop in tear production, and a rise in temperature and humidity.</p><p>Amy Watts, director of optometry and contact lens service, and director of the vision rehabilitation service at Massachusetts Eye and Ear in Boston, said corneal function also plays a role.</p><p>\"Our cornea is the only part of the body that receives its oxygen from the atmosphere and not our blood supply,\" she noted. </p><p>So, \"when we close our eyes at night, we reduce the amount of oxygen to our cornea by cutting the corneas off from the oxygen-rich atmosphere,\" Watts explained.</p><p>\"Wearing a contact lens further reduces the oxygen while asleep, and may put us just past the tipping point for keeping our corneas in optimal condition to fight off microbes,\" she said.</p><p>Another issue is that people who sleep with their lenses also tend to shower with them in place. And \"tap water -- just like water in lakes, pools, ponds, oceans -- can have microbes that may cause a serious eye infection,\" Watts said. \"In extreme cases, these infections can cause a severe loss in vision.\"</p><p>Both Watts and Schein said preventing corneal infection is best achieved by wearing single-day disposable lenses.</p><p> Schein said, \"This approach also removes the need for solution use and, most importantly, obviates the need for a contact lens case, an important advantage, since contamination of the case is certainly a risk factor for infection. However, if the user tries to save money by not discarding the lens daily, then the safety advantage is entirely lost.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, he advises any wearer who develops a painful red eye to remove their lenses and see an eye care specialist within 24 hours.</p><p>\"Most emergency rooms are not equipped with eye specialists or the equipment -- [such as a] slit lamp biomicroscope -- necessary to distinguish a simple abrasion from an infection,\" Schein cautioned. \"Therefore, those who go to emergency departments initially should be seen in follow up as soon as possible by an eye care professional.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has more on <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm048893.htm\" target=\"_new\">contact lens safety</a>.</p>",

Two staff members conducted detailed analyses to verify the ethnicity of each person who died of a drug overdose between 2013 and 2015.</p><p>The study found steep increases in opioid overdose death rates among Native Americans. Young males ages 25-54 were hit hardest. In fact, young Native American men had more than double the odds of dying of an opioid OD than their similarly aged white peers, the study showed.</p><p>Why the big disparity? Joshi and her colleagues believe societal issues may play a role.</p><p>American Indians and Alaska Natives \"experience high rates of physical, emotional, and historical trauma and significant socioeconomic disparities, which might contribute to higher rates of drug use in these communities,\" they wrote.</p><p>They added that Indian Health Services has also suffered from \"longstanding underfunding,\" so Native Americans continue to \"face barriers to receiving quality medical and behavioral health care.\"</p><p>Another physician working in the field called the Washington state findings \"chilling.\"</p><p>They \"reveal an alarming trend with the American Indian/Alaska Native community,\" said Dr. Harshal Kirane. He directs addiction services at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City.</p><p>Kirane called for urgent action to \"mobilize adequate support for this community.\"</p><p>Glatter said so-called \"medication-assisted treatment\" (MAT) programs, which help addicts reduce and then quit opioids, are key.</p><p>These interventions are an \"evidence-based and validated approach to treating those affected, while also reducing the risk of relapse,\" he explained. Also helpful: dispensing OD-antidote naloxone kits to help save lives.</p><p>Joshi's group agreed, noting that the Indian Health Service is already forging partnerships with tribal governments and regional Indian health boards. Together, they are boosting access to \"medication-assisted treatment and naloxone for first responders,\" the researchers said.</p><p>The new findings were published in the Dec. 21 <i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</i>, a journal of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on  <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/statedeaths.html\" target=\"_new\">overdose deaths</a>.</p>",

Now, research suggests those sleep troubles raise the odds of immune system dysfunction -- which in turn can trigger chronic inflammation.</p><p>For the surviving spouse, that could mean an increased risk for heart disease and cancer, though the study did not prove a cause-and-effect link.</p><p>\"We think these individuals are more vulnerable to the negative effects of poor sleep,\" said corresponding author Diana Chirinos. She's a research assistant professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.</p><p> The study included 101 people, average age 67. Half had recently lost a spouse, while the other half were married or single.</p><p>Researchers found that the association between sleep disturbances and inflammation was two to three times higher in the grieving spouses, according to the study published recently in the journal <i>Psychosomatic Medicine</i>.</p><p>\"The death of a spouse is an acutely stressful event, and they have to adapt to living without the support of the spouse,\" Chirinos said. \"Add sleep disturbance to their already stressful situation, and you double the stressor. As a result, their immune system is more overactivated.\"</p><p>Grieving spouses are at increased risk of developing heart disease or dying within a year of their partner's death, the researchers noted.</p><p>\"We already knew bereaved people had higher inflammation and a higher risk for heart disease and dying within a year of the spouse's death,\" Chirinos said. \"But what was causing it? Was it the grief or sadness itself, loneliness or sleep? Now we know it's not the grief itself; it is the sleep disturbance that arises from that grief.\"</p><p>The main sleep problem associated with an overactivated immune system was poor sleep efficiency, which can include insomnia, early waking or difficulty falling asleep.</p><p>For bereaved people, the study highlights the importance of treating sleep problems, Chirinos said, adding that doctors need to ask patients about their sleep after a spouse dies. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Mental Health America has more on <a href=\"http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/conditions/coping-loss-bereavement-and-grief\" target=\"_new\">bereavement and grief</a>.</p>",

Now,  generics maker Mylan Pharmaceuticals is adding more products to the list.</p><p>The recall involves 104 lots of three medicines:  valsartan tablets; combination tablets with the drugs valsartan and amlodipine; and combination tablets with valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide.</p><p>The reason for the move is similar to that cited in prior valsartan recalls: Mylan said it had detected trace amounts of a probable cancer-causing chemical called N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) in valsartan meds.</p><p>NDEA is found in certain foods, drinking water, air pollution and industrial processes.</p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is currently trying to trace the source of the contaminants, originally linked to factories in China and India that help supply valsartan to generic drug makers. Those factories were linked to contamination with a second type of potential carcinogen, called N-nitrosodimethylamine, or NDMA.</p><p>Valsartan is used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and to reduce the risk of death after a heart attack. Valsartan in combination with amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide is used to treat high blood pressure.</p><p>The expanded recall includes: 26 lots of amlodipine and valsartan tablets, USP (5 mg/160 mg; 10 mg/160 mg; 5 mg/320 mg; and 10 mg/320 mg); 51 lots of valsartan tablets, USP (40 mg, 80 mg, 160 mg and 320 mg); and 27 lots of valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, USP (80 mg/12.5 mg; 160 mg/12.5 mg; 160 mg/25 mg; 320 mg/12.5 mg; and 320 mg/25 mg).</p><p>The drugs were distributed in the United States between March 2017 and November 2018.</p><p>For the FDA's full detailed list of all the recalled valsartan products, look <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/UCM615703.pdfutm_campaign=FDA%20updates%20on%20angiotensin%20II%20receptor%20blocker%20%28ARB%29%20recalls%3A%20Mylan%20expands&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Eloqua\" target=\"_new\">here</a>.</p> <p>Speaking with <i>USA Today</i>, the FDA's Janet Woodcock said that \"we still don't understand the complete root cause of this problem. We understand part of it. We don't understand all of the steps that led to this.\"</p><p>Woodcock directs the agency's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. She said the factories implicated in the recall have been placed on \"import alert,\" meaning that drugs manufactured by these plants cannot enter the United States.</p><p>In addition, all \"sartan\" medicines are being tested to be sure they don't contain the contaminants, Woodcock said.  So far, the carcinogens have not turned up in Diovan, the brand-name version of valsartan made by Novartis, she noted.</p><p>\"I would think these recalls would start dropping off now,\" Woodcock told <i>USA Today</i>. \"We've had this import alert in place for quite a long time, and the companies buying from these sources were told to check and recall.\"</p><p>In the meantime, Mylan said that patients who are taking valsartan should continue to do so, because the risk to their health may be higher if they stop taking it immediately without any alternative treatment.</p><p>Instead, patients should talk to their pharmacist or physician about an alternative treatment, and should contact their healthcare provider if they've experienced any problems that may be related to the recalled valsartan products, the company advised.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart Association has more on <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure/types-of-blood-pressure-medications#.W1CmjdhKh0s\" target=\"_new\">high blood pressure medications</a>.</p>",

A study done by researchers at Penn State University found out just how early that learning should start -- by age 2.</p><p>For this study, parents filled out surveys about how many words their 2-year-olds knew, and then the researchers checked in with them three years later when their children were in kindergarten. The toddlers with a large vocabulary were more likely to start kindergarten ready to read and learn math. It turned out that they also paid more attention in class and were better behaved. This may also be why some kids do better than others in school.</p><p>Building that vocabulary stems from very early and frequent interactions with mom and dad. It takes only simple things to engage baby, such as talking and reading. In fact, it's hard to overstress the importance of reading to babies. A separate study done at the University of Iowa found that babies respond more to reading than to even toy- or puppet-play and, in turn, learn more from it.</p><p>A very young baby may only babble in response to hearing your voice as you read, but when you respond back by repeating or expanding on his or her sound or offering a word with that sound, this back-and-forth interaction helps with language development.</p><p>Another important difference maker for a child's early development is to read books with bright pictures and simple sentences rather than single words. Be engaged as you to read so that baby will develop not only a great vocabulary, but also a love for books that will serve him or her well throughout life.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The organization Reading Rockets has great tips on <a href=\" http://www.readingrockets.org/article/reading-tips-parents-babies\" target=\"_new\">reading to babies</a>.</p>",

But there are safety precautions to take when you leave a protected indoor environment.</p><p>The Road Runners Club of America has a wealth of advice.</p><p>For starters, take some precautions before you leave home. First, tell loved ones where you'll be running. Next, in addition to taking ID with you, write your name, phone number and blood type (in case of an accident) inside one of your running shoes. Also, carry your cellphone.</p><p>\"There's safety in numbers\" is an old expression that still holds true. Steer clear of unpopulated areas, deserted or unlit streets, even overgrown trails. Trust your intuition -- if a situation just doesn't feel right, stay away from it. Also get in the habit of varying your running pattern, but do run in familiar areas.</p><p>While it's easy to lose yourself in your thoughts or music, stay alert. That means skipping the headphones. You want both your eyes and ears attuned to your environment.</p><p>Whether you run on city streets or country roads, go against the flow of traffic so you can see oncoming vehicles and they can see you. This should allow you to react more quickly to a problem.</p><p>Remember mom's lessons about crossing streets -- look both ways at all intersections. Do obey traffic signals, and don't blindly assume that drivers will see you or that they'll stop for you, especially those turning into your path.</p><p>If you want to go running while traveling, ask the local running club or running store for safe routes. Stick to areas with open businesses in case of an emergency and, of course, follow all the safety steps you would at home.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more <a href=\"https://www.rrca.org/education/rrca-general-running-safety-tips\" target=\"_new\">safety tips</a> check out the website of the Road Runners Club of America.</p>",

If you have symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, tightness in your chest or shortness of breath when you exercise in cold weather, you may have undiagnosed asthma.</li><li>If you have asthma, warm up with gentle exercises for about 15 minutes before you start more intense exercise. Cover your mouth and nose with a scarf or face mask when you exercise in cold weather. Take your recommended asthma medicines.</li><li>Another option is to move your workouts indoors when the outside temperature falls below freezing.</li><li>Scented candles and wood-burning fireplaces can trigger allergy and asthma symptoms. Consider flameless candles and an electric fireplace instead.</li><li>If you or a family member has food allergies, think about hosting holiday events.

They then tracked weight gain in the babies to age 3 years.</p><p>Antibiotics and antimicrobial agents can alter any person's gut makeup (microbiome) by killing off certain species of bacteria, which allows room for others to blossom.</p><p>The most notorious example is <i>Clostridium difficile</i>, a bacteria that can flourish from overuse of antibiotics and lead to life-threatening diarrhea.</p><p>According to Kozyrskyj, \"Disinfectant products used very often, weekly or greater, did cause changes to the infants' gut bacteria. It caused some bacteria to decline and others to increase.\" </p><p>Specifically, antibacterial cleaners were linked to an increase in gut levels of <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> in infants.</p><p><i>Lachnospiraceae</i> bacteria should not be heavily present in the guts of babies who are not yet on solid food, explained Gail Cresci, an expert in pediatric gastroenterology with the Cleveland Clinic.</p><p>These bacteria typically are \"good\" bacteria that feed on tough-to-digest carbohydrate fibers, contributing extra energy to the body, Cresci said.</p><p>\"You don't start to see them until the diet has been advanced to solids, around the age of 2 or 3,\" she added.</p><p>Having an abundance of <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> bacteria from an early age could cause growing kids to be bombarded with additional calories, Cresci said.</p><p>\"It could make sense that if there is an increase of these bacteria early, at 3 months, it could then allow the microbiome to harvest more energy and at that age, it would be stored as fat,\" Cresci explained. \"That could potentially contribute to obesity later.\"</p><p>Infants living in homes with the highest use of disinfectants were twice as likely to have a gut microbiome enriched with <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, the researchers reported.</p><p>Higher <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> levels were associated with higher BMI scores at ages 1 and 3, according to the report.</p><p> Kozyrskyj said that the researchers  \"found that those <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> elevated with disinfectant use were likely responsible for this overweight development. They were in the pathway.\"</p><p>Infants were more likely to have normal weight when eco-friendly cleaners were used daily. These cleaners are either homemade or store-bought cleaners that use natural ingredients such as vinegar, peroxide, baking soda, citric acid or essential oils, Kozyrskyj noted.</p><p>Although the findings are interesting, you can't draw a clear cause-and-effect relationship from this study, said Dr. Sheela Magge, director of pediatric endocrinology at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore.</p><p>\"I would agree there's biologic plausibility, but we obviously need more work to establish what's the cause and what's the effect,\" Magge said. \"It's always difficult to really establish that one particular thing, in this case these household cleaners, causes increased weight gain.\"</p><p>The study, which was funded in part by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, was published Sept. 17 in the <i>CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal)</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Cleaning Institute has more about <a href=\"https://www.cleaninginstitute.org/clean_living_at_home/\" target=\"_new\">household cleaners</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Oct. 1, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- People with type 2 diabetes who are taking common drugs called diuretics may be at a significantly increased risk of losing a foot or leg, according to a new French study.</p><p>Researchers found that taking a diuretic raised the odds of having an amputation, or requiring an angioplasty or bypass, by 75 percent or more, compared with those not using the medicines.</p><p>Based on the findings, \"diuretics should be used cautiously in patients with type 2 diabetes at risk of amputations,\" concluded a team led by diabetes specialist Dr. Louis Potier, of Bichat Hospital in Paris.</p><p>But one U.S. expert said that restricting the use of diuretics puts diabetic patients \"between a rock and a hard place.\"</p><p>As Dr. Gerald Bernstein explained, diuretics are used to help \"get rid of extra salt and water\" in the blood, thereby helping patients control blood sugar and blood pressure.</p><p>In turn, that could help ward off a major killer: congestive heart failure.</p><p>So, the challenge is to \"select the right drugs to prevent worsening of heart failure in order to prevent increased risk for amputations,\" said Bernstein, coordinator for the Friedman Diabetes Program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>As Bernstein explained, \"type 2 diabetes is a disease heavily associated with cardiovascular complications, in particular the big arteries from the heart to the rest of the body. When these arteries and the heart are diseased there is abnormal blood flow to all the organs but the lower extremities can be affected most because of how long that artery is.\"</p><p>When circulation issues to the leg and foot become severe, amputation is often the only option.</p> <p>How much might particular diabetes medicines affect the odds of needing an amputation?</p><p>To help find out, Potier's team tracked outcomes for nearly 1,500 people with type 2 diabetes. The study specifically focused on amputations, as well as procedures such as angioplasty or the bypassing of blocked or damaged blood vessels. Those procedures are used to improve circulation and prevent leg or foot amputations.</p><p>Participants were followed until they had a leg procedure or died. Nearly 700 of the study participants were taking a diuretic drug.</p><p>Over a follow-up of about seven years, 13 percent of those taking a diuretic had an amputation or other procedure on their lower leg, compared with just 7 percent of those not taking a diuretic.</p><p>Said another way, this meant that taking a diuretic increased the risk of having an amputation or an angioplasty/bypass by 75 percent or more, compared with those not using one.</p><p>Most of this increase involved amputations, which nearly doubled for those taking a diuretic.</p><p>The results of the study were presented Monday at the meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, in Berlin. </p><p>It's important to note the study was observational in nature, meaning that while it could point to an association between diuretics and amputation rates, it could not prove cause and effect, and other factors might be at play. Furthermore, research presented at medical meetings is typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>According to Bernstein, the take-home message here is not to immediately discontinue the use of diuretics, but to keep in mind that \"the patient and physician must be very careful not to overtreat and be very selective\" in which drugs are used to fight diabetes.</p><p>Diabetes specialist Dr. Robert Courgi agreed. Reviewing the findings, he said that while more study is needed to confirm the results, \"if a patient is at risk for amputation then perhaps diuretics should be avoided for other equally effective options.\" Courgi is an endocrinologist at Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on type 2 diabetes, visit the <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/type-2/\" target=\"_new\"> American Diabetes Association</a>.</p>",

And taking standard-dose aspirin (325 milligrams) was not associated with a lower risk of ovarian cancer.</p><p>On the flip side, taking 10 or more tablets per week of non-aspirin NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, for a number of years may be associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, the study authors said.</p><p>\"What really differentiated this study from prior work was that we were able to analyze low-dose aspirin separately from standard-dose aspirin,\" said study leader Mollie Barnard, who conducted the research while a doctoral student at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.</p><p>\"Our findings emphasize that research on aspirin use and cancer risk must consider aspirin dose,\" she added in a Harvard news release.</p><p>Barnard is now a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Utah's Huntsman Cancer Institute.</p><p>Ovarian cancer is the fifth-leading cause of cancer death among U.S. women. There's growing evidence that inflammation plays a role in the development of this cancer. It's believed that aspirin may lower ovarian cancer risk by reducing inflammation.</p><p>\"More research is needed to figure out which women can benefit most from taking low-dose aspirin to reduce their risk of ovarian cancer,\" study senior author Shelley Tworoger, associate center director of population science at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Fla., said in the news release.

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY,  Oct. 4, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Vitamin D supplements have long been touted as a way to improve bone health and possibly ward off the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis in older adults.</p><p>But a new study contends that claims of benefits from supplements  of the \"sunshine vitamin\" fall flat.</p><p>A review of  previously published studies found that taking either high or low doses of vitamin D supplements didn't prevent fractures or falls, or improve bone density.</p><p>Vitamin D is found in very few foods. One of the biggest sources of the vitamin is exposure to sunlight.</p><p>\"Vitamin D supplement use is common, particularly in North America,\" where up to 40 percent of older people take them, said lead researcher Dr. Alison Avenell. She is clinical chair in health services research at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.</p><p>\"Most adults don't need to take vitamin D supplements, although they are unlikely to do harm if taken in low doses,\" she added.</p><p>Vitamin D supplements do prevent rare conditions, such as rickets in children and osteomalacia (softening of bones) in adults. People at risk of vitamin D deficiency include those with little or no sun exposure, such as nursing home residents who are indoors all the time, or those who always cover their skin when outside, Avenell said.</p><p>There's also existing evidence that vitamin D helps prevent cancer or heart disease, she added. </p><p>\"Preserving bone strength involves keeping active, not smoking, not being too thin, and taking medications for osteoporosis,\" Avenell said.</p><p>Based on the new findings, Avenell thinks guidelines that recommend vitamin D supplements for bone health should be changed. </p><p>For the new report, Avenell and her colleagues reviewed 81 studies, most of which dealt with vitamin D alone, not in combination with the mineral calcium. </p><p>\"Calcium supplements on their own have minimal effect on bone mineral density and fracture, and may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease,\" Avenell said. </p><p>The only evidence that calcium and vitamin D together prevent fractures comes from a trial of older people with very low vitamin D levels in nursing homes. But calcium and vitamin D may also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, Avenell said. </p><p>In addition, most of the studies covered in the new review included women aged 65 and older who took more than 800 IUs (international units) of vitamin D daily.</p><p>The new study found no meaningful effect of vitamin D supplementation when it came to reducing any fracture, hip fractures or falls. </p><p>This type of study, called a meta-analysis, tries to find common elements among previously published studies. This kind or research, however, is limited by differences in the methods and conclusions of the different studies analyzed by researchers, so the findings may not be consistent across the board. </p><p>A group that represents the supplement industry took issue with the findings.</p><p>\"There is evidence that vitamin D is very helpful, especially when you have low levels,\" said Duffy MacKay, senior vice president for scientific and regulatory affairs at the Council for Responsible Nutrition.</p><p>Over 94 percent of the U.S. population has vitamin D levels that are too low, he said. \"Most Americans do not get enough vitamin D to meet their needs and supplements can fill that gap, but if your vitamin D levels are sufficient you don't need to supplement.\"</p><p>The benefit of proper vitamin D levels are seen over a lifetime and can't be judged in short-term studies that look at any specific benefit, he added.</p> <p>Dr. Minisha Sood, an endocrinologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said this new study should convince doctors that vitamin D supplements don't have a role in maintaining healthy bones, but they do have other benefits.</p><p>Previous research suggests that vitamin D, when taken in tandem with calcium, may help prevent certain cancers and protect against age-related  declines in thinking and memory.</p><p>\"What is important to keep in mind is that those with low vitamin D were not represented in this meta-analysis, and vitamin D supplementation -- repletion, actually -- is still necessary for those with low vitamin D levels, regardless of age,\" Sood said.</p><p>The findings were published online Oct. 4 in <i>The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on vitamin D, visit the <a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institutes of Health</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Oct. 22, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- When Tom Broussard came out of quadruple heart bypass surgery, the then-59-year-old was just glad to have avoided a heart attack. So he didn't give much thought to the heart valve that surgeons replaced at the same time.</p> <p>\"I figured everything was fixed and didn't need to worry about it,\" Broussard said of the 2011 procedures. </p> <p>A few months later, Broussard had a stroke caused by a clot that doctors suspect developed after his surgery. He spent the next 11 months relearning how to read, write and speak. He worked through other health challenges, including renal failure that caused him to lose a kidney.</p> <p>So when Broussard, who lives in St. Augustine, Fla., started having trouble breathing in July 2017, he never imagined it could be from a problem with his heart valve.</p> <p>Affecting about 2.5 percent of Americans, heart valve disease occurs when one or more of the heart valves have been damaged, disrupting blood flow by not opening or closing properly. Valve disease becomes more common with age, affecting about 13 percent of adults age 75 and older. </p> <p>Yet awareness of heart valve problems is relatively low, in part because symptoms -- which include shortness of breath and fatigue -- aren't specific and may develop so slowly that they go unnoticed, said cardiologist Dr. Vuyisile T. Nkomo, director of the Valvular Heart Disease Clinic at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.</p> <p>\"We often miss the window to offer lifesaving therapies because the condition is so severe it makes intervening too risky,\" Nkomo said.</p> <p>Valve disease is often overlooked by health providers, especially in patients with competing conditions, making it underdiagnosed, Nkomo said. Patients, he said, should be aware of their risk factors and advocate for themselves. In addition to older age, risk factors for valve problems include previous heart valve issues, heart attack and heart failure.</p> <p>When Broussard first noticed his symptoms, he thought it was a bad cold or the flu. But as the symptoms worsened, he made two visits to a clinic before going to the emergency room.</p> <p>\"I had to sleep sitting up because I felt like I was drowning,\" he said. </p> <p>Testing showed fluid in his lungs, and his heart was straining. More tests showed the tissue-based aortic valve that had been placed six years earlier had failed. </p> <p>Within a week, Broussard underwent a transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or TAVR, a minimally invasive surgical procedure that wedges a replacement valve into the aortic valve's place through a catheter, similar to a stent placement.</p> <p>The diagnosis took Broussard by surprise. After brushing off his first valve replacement, this time he was determined to learn all he could, including about how to control risk factors. </p> <p>Broussard, now 66, exercises regularly, keeps his weight down and watches his diet. He also learned that his family history of heart disease -- his dad died from a heart attack at age 49  may have increased his risk.</p> <p>\"I wish I'd been told when my dad died that I could have heart disease and watched more closely,\" said Broussard, who now works to educate others as a Heart Valve Ambassador for the American Heart Association.</p> <p>Even after his first heart valve surgery, Broussard said he didn't realize that he'd need to watch for symptoms over the years. </p> <p>\"Patients play an important role,\" he said. \"Being vigilant and keeping track of your body and sharing any changes with your doctor is important.\"</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY,  Oct. 25, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Anxiety, depression and panic attacks are sending U.S. college students to mental health clinics in record numbers, a new study finds.</p><p>Between 2009 and 2015, treatment and diagnoses of anxiety increased by nearly 6 percent among these students, followed by depression and panic attacks, which each increased about 3 percent. Anxiety is the most common problem, affecting almost 15 percent of college students across the United States, the researchers reported.</p><p>\"Mental health is a critical issue for college students, and institutions of higher education need to explore prevention and support strategies that best meet the needs of their campus,\" said lead researcher Sara Oswalt. She is chair of the department of kinesiology, health and nutrition at the University of Texas at San Antonio.</p><p>It's not clear if the college environment is causing or even contributing to the increase in these problems. But if mental health problems aren't addressed, success in school is jeopardized, she said.</p><p>Oswalt believes more students are seeking help because more of them are suffering from mental health problems, coupled with a willingness to get help. There is less stigma about mental health issues, and schools may be providing more mental health services.</p><p>For the study, Oswalt and her colleagues used data from the American College Health Association to collect information on more than 450,000 undergraduates.</p><p>The investigators found a significant increase in the diagnosis and treatment for eight of 12 mental problems they examined, with anxiety, depression and panic attacks accounting for the biggest increases.</p><p>The researchers also found that students are more willing to use university mental health services. </p><p>By 2015, nearly 20 percent of those surveyed said they used these services, an increase of more than 4 percent since 2009. Moreover, nearly 75 percent said they would consider using university mental health services -- an increase of nearly 7 percent. </p><p>College students' need for mental health resources is increasing, Oswalt said, so schools need to do more to safeguard their students' well-being. They must do it in a way that is effective and use outside services when they cannot handle demand themselves, she suggested.</p><p>Because 75 percent of all serious adult psychiatric illnesses start by age 25, universities have an essential role in addressing mental health issues early, Oswalt explained.</p><p>According to Stewart Cooper, director of counseling services at Valparaiso University in Indiana, \"Oswalt appropriately advocates for a systems approach to respond to these often debilitating disorders among college students.\"</p><p> Cooper suggested several approaches,  starting with ways to avoid emotional problems in healthy students. These include building resilience along with ways to manage stress and get enough sleep. </p><p>In addition, programs are needed that focus on detecting mental health problems early -- making it possible to prevent them from getting worse -- and to minimize complications and limit disabilities before the problem becomes severe. \"Mental health screening days and evidence-based materials and interventions that are technology-based fit here,\" he said. </p><p>Schools also need to offer therapy to students to reduce the negative effect of an already established mental health problem. These programs can help restore function and reduce complications, Cooper said.</p><p>The report was published Oct. 24 in the <i>Journal of American College Health</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.nami.org/Find-Support/Teens-Young-Adults/Managing-a-Mental-Health-Condition-in-College\" target=\"_new\"> National Alliance on Mental Illness</a> for more on mental health among college students.</p>",

She's an emergency medicine resident with the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Three of the patients died from their overdose, Khatri and her colleagues reported in the Nov. 1 <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p>Fentanyl has been increasingly found in drugs seized by law enforcement, said Emily Feinstein, executive vice president of the Center on Addiction, in New York City.</p><p>These illegal drugs include heroin and cocaine, as well as methamphetamine, ketamine and counterfeit prescription pills, Feinstein said.</p><p>Fentanyl is 50 to 100 times more potent than heroin, and an amount equivalent to the size of a grain of rice can kill you, she said.</p><p>\"Fentanyl is so cheap, and the drug cartels have great access to it. It is a tremendously effective filler because it's highly addicting. If it doesn't kill them, people get an intense reaction that creates addiction,\" Feinstein explained. \"It's cheap, it has a strong high and it makes people come back for more.\"</p><p>Between 2012 and 2016 there's been a 23-fold increase in the number of deaths involving cocaine in combination with synthetic opioids, according to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse. That amounted to 4,184 deaths in 2016.</p><p>\"We're really in a fentanyl epidemic right now,\" Feinstein said. \"Overdose death rates are really driven by fentanyl.\"</p><p>At Khatri's hospital, the 18 patients all came in with textbook signs of opioid poisoning -- lethargy, pinpoint pupils and dangerous slowing of their respiration.</p><p>Doctors administered the OD drug naloxone to 17 patients, who required higher doses than are usually needed to reverse an opioid overdose.</p><p>Urine tests drawn from 16 of the patients showed they had used cocaine, and 15 patients also had confirmed fentanyl exposure in concentrations consistent with severe poisoning, the study authors said.</p><p>Khatri recommended that hospital emergency departments keep rapid-testing strips for fentanyl on hand, so doctors can respond quickly to unintentional fentanyl overdoses.</p><p>Fentanyl has been making its way into both crack and powder cocaine, Feinstein said.</p><p>The New York City Department of Health has launched a campaign aimed at protecting young adults who party in bars and occasionally use cocaine, Feinstein said.</p><p>Bartenders are being trained to administer naloxone, and signs are being hung in bathrooms warning people not to use cocaine by themselves, she said.</p><p>\"This is an opioid-naive population that is recreationally using cocaine and not realizing how prevalent fentanyl is,\" Feinstein said.</p><p>Feinstein emphasized how quickly fentanyl can kill.</p><p>\"If you experience an overdose, the time to death is much shorter than heroin. You're talking minutes, instead of hours,\" she stated. \"You have a much shorter window in which your life can be saved.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse has more about <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/fentanyl\" target=\"_new\">fentanyl</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 1, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Babies who are prescribed antibiotics before they're 2 years old may be more likely to become obese children, new research suggests.</p><p>Acid reflux medications may also up the risk, though that connection was not as strong.</p><p>The findings come from the tracking of infant medication histories and childhood obesity incidence among hundreds of thousands of children up until age 8. All had received care through the U.S. military health care system.</p><p>As to why a link was seen, investigators theorized it could have to do with the impact such medications have on the delicate microbial environment (microbiome) found in a growing child's gut.</p><p>\"We did not evaluate the microbiome status of these children,\" stressed study author Dr. Cade Nylund, a lieutenant colonel with Medical Corps of the U.S. Air Force. \"And this was an observational study, so we can only demonstrate the findings of an association, not a specific cause.</p><p>\"So we presume this has to do with changes in a child's microbiome brought on by these medications,\" he added. \"But it could also just be the result of having an infection. Or having a fever, maybe with or without taking antibiotics. Or it might have something to do with the psychosocial dynamics of a family. We don't yet know.\"</p><p>As to what parents should make of these findings, Nylund said the most important thing is to ensure that children take the medications they need, but not when it isn't warranted.</p><p>For example, Nylund noted that acid reflux medications -- such as histamine blockers and proton pump inhibitors -- \"are often prescribed in infants when they're not indicated. Acid reflux is normal in infants, and not really a good reason to put them on reflux meds. And most infants grow out of the problem by 12 months.\"</p><p>On the other hand, Nylund acknowledged that \"antibiotics play a big role in treating infections, and they always will.</p><p>\"And I would certainly hate for a parent to not treat a child with antibiotics for an infection out of a concern for obesity,\" he added.</p><p>In the study, published Nov. 1 in the journal <i>Gut</i>, researchers followed roughly 333,000 children born between 2006 and 2013.</p><p>More than 241,000 had been prescribed antibiotics before the age of 2. Nearly 40,000 had been prescribed histamine blockers, while more than 11,000 had been prescribed proton pump inhibitors. Almost 6,000 kids had been prescribed all three drugs.</p><p>Based on an average of four pediatrician visits after age 2 and up until age 8, investigators determined that nearly 47,000 children (14 percent) became obese. Of these, about 9,600 had never been prescribed an antibiotic or acid reflux medication while an infant; the rest had.</p><p>After stacking medication histories up against obesity incidence, the research team concluded that infants prescribed antibiotics faced a 26 percent greater risk for childhood obesity by the age of 3. That risk rose the longer an infant had taken antibiotics, and among infants who had taken medications in multiple antibiotic classes.</p><p>Acid reflux medications also appeared to raise childhood obesity risk, though the connection was characterized as \"weak.\"</p><p>Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a senior scientist in child health research at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, said the findings are interesting because they raise \"questions about factors such as antibiotics and medications that alter gut microbiome and can potentially influence other health conditions.\" She was not involved with the study.</p><p>But Gupta cautioned that for now the findings should only be viewed as an \"important association.\" More research will be needed \"to truly understand cause and effect, as it is a complex condition influenced by many environmental, behavioral and genetic factors,\" she said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more information on obesity and obesity risk factors at <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/overweight-and-obesity\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</a>.</p>",

After adjusting for various factors, they found that those who said they brushed less than twice a day for less than two minutes had a three-fold increased heart risk, compared to those who said they brushed at least twice a day for at least two minutes.</p> <p>Dr. Shogo Matsui, the study's lead researcher, said the findings suggest \"poor oral health, based on daily teeth-brushing behavior, is associated with\" poorer heart health. It's possible that longer tooth brushing might reduce this risk, but the new study was not designed to prove cause-and-effect, said Matsui, a researcher at the Institute of Biomedical and Health Sciences at Hiroshima University in Japan.</p> <p>Dr. Ann Bolger, a cardiologist and professor of medicine emeritus at the University of California, San Francisco, agreed that the observational study had limitations.</p> <p>\"It is possible that people who are very attentive to their dental health are also very attentive to other aspects of their health,\" said Bolger, who was not involved in the research.</p> <p>Even so, Bolger said the science supports a potential connection between dental health and heart health. Gum disease is one of the diseases \"where the body may be in a sort of continual state of inflammation, and this seems to be a very powerful predictor of cardiovascular disease,\" she said.</p> <p>A separate study published last month in the journal <i>Hypertension</i> found that gum disease appears to worsen blood pressure and interferes with medications to treat hypertension.</p><p>Poor dental health also poses a risk to people with heart valve problems, Bolger said.</p> <p>\"I spend an inordinate amount of time talking to (heart valve patients) about their teeth because we know certain heart valve infections can be associated with poor oral health,\" she said.</p> <p>This latest research \"is a good reminder that the mouth is an important part of a person's entire health and simple, daily behaviors that improve health are incredibly important.\"</p> <p>The American Dental Association recommends brushing your teeth twice a day for two minutes with fluoride toothpaste.</p> <p>\"It's a low-risk, low-cost option that we know has other benefits even beyond the scope of what this study is trying to investigate,\" Bolger said. \"There's no reason not to recommend someone do this.\"</p>",

High blood pressure was tied to a more than 80 percent higher risk for heart attack risk in women than in men; type 1 diabetes was associated with an almost three times higher risk in women than in men; and type 2 diabetes with a 47 percent higher risk in women than in men.</p><p>One risk factor -- overweight or obesity -- was associated with similar increases in heart attack risk in women and men, the researchers reported Nov. 7 in <i>The BMJ</i>.</p><p>\"Overall, more men experience heart attacks than women,\" Millett, an epidemiologist at Oxford's George Institute for Global Health, said in a university news release. \"However, several major risk factors increase the risk in women more than they increase the risk in men, so women with these factors experience a relative disadvantage.\" </p><p>Two cardiologists in the United States said the findings highlight that heart disease is certainly not a \"males-only\" disease.</p><p>\"What makes this study important, is that over half of the studied population was female -- most cardiovascular studies have a male majority,\" noted Dr. Satjit Bhursri, who practices at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>\"It is also true that women are less likely to get similar screen and prevention interventions than men,\" he said. \"This study brings to light the importance that screening for cardiovascular disease is universal, as are the outcomes.\"</p><p>Dr. Cindy Grines directs cardiology at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y.

Wait times, which are partially driven by the geographic availability of donor organs, are generally months long. </p> <p>In the study, presented Saturday at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions conference in Chicago, researchers looked at people awaiting their first heart transplant between 2005 and 2016. Of the 36,801 patients, about 67 percent were white, 22 percent were African-American and 8 percent were Hispanic. </p> <p> The wait time peaked in 2014 for patients across all racial and ethnic groups but was disproportionately longer for African-American patients -- a median of 19.8 months compared with 12 months for white patients and 12.3 months for Hispanic patients. The disparity was less pronounced in the years that followed. In 2016, for example, median wait time was 10.1 months for African-American patients, eight months for white patients, and 7.4 months for Hispanic patients.</p> <p>\"After adjusting for some of the variables that could impact wait time like age, blood type and geographical region, the time to transplant was observed to be longer for African-Americans compared to whites,\" said Dr. Anuradha Lala, lead author of the study and an assistant professor at Mount Sinai Medical School in New York City.</p> <p>Lala cautioned that it's too early to draw definite conclusions about what caused the difference in wait time. The findings, she said, did not account for other factors that may have had an impact.</p> <p>\"It is important to understand whether disparities exist and, if so, the next step is to understand the factors that underlie the differences in wait times and, of those factors, which can we target for intervention to reduce or eliminate disparities,\" she said.</p> <p> However, wait times and donor supply are dynamic and can change rapidly, and some experts are skeptical that the differences are due to race.</p> <p>\"I don't think we can infer a high degree of bias in the decision (of heart allocation). So much is driven by objective measures,\" said Dr. Clyde Yancy, chief of cardiology and Magerstadt Professor of Medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.</p> <p>\"It's impossible to control for all other variables and have race and ethnicity emerge as the predominant reason for longer wait times. You're dealing with people at the edge of life with a number of comorbidities and variables that determine their clinical stability or instability,\" said Yancy, who was not involved in the study. \"We will use those hearts in the very best way we can, for those who are desperately ill and have a chance of surviving.\"</p> <p> Lala believes this is an important area for ongoing investigation, especially in light of the United Network for Organ Sharing's new heart allocation system that took effect last month. The new system is designed to ensure that the most critically ill patients receive a transplant sooner. Candidates are now listed according to six medical urgency statuses and there's more flexibility in terms of how far a heart can travel from donor to recipient.</p> <p> But it's unclear how the new system will ultimately impact wait times and outcomes. </p> <p>\"We need to continually look at wait times under the new system,\" Lala said. \"If we notice there are disparities, we need to try to understand why and what can be done to minimize them.\"</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 13, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- The sharp and sudden pain from an aortic dissection, along with the emergency treatment that follows, can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder years later, a new study finds.</p> <p> An aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition in which a tear in the wall of the aorta -- the major artery carrying blood out of the heart -- allows blood to rush between the wall's layers. Most people who have one say they feel a sudden ripping or stabbing chest pain that sometimes spreads to the back. It is usually treated with surgery and medication.</p> <p> In a study of aortic dissection patients treated at the Cleveland Clinic, researchers reached out to 295 people with an online survey that included four questions commonly used to screen for PTSD. </p> <p> Patients were asked whether they startled easily, or felt constantly on guard since their dissection. They also were asked about feeling numb or detached from others, whether they had nightmares or unwelcome thoughts about their dissection, or if they went out of their way to avoid situations that reminded them of it.</p> <p> About 44 percent of those surveyed, or 129 people, answered all four screening questions. Of that group, 22 percent screened positive for PTSD. The results \"absolutely shocked\" researchers, said Selena Pasadyn, a medical student at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine and the study's lead investigator.</p> <p>\"We're advancing a lot in our care for these patients. We're able to get them through this acute event, but it's also our responsibility as physicians to think about their long-term quality of life,\" Pasadyn said. \"This is a cry to physicians to consider PTSD, to screen for it, and to refer and treat appropriately.\" </p> <p> She said she also hopes to raise awareness among patients so they can become better advocates for themselves.</p> <p>\"They need to be aware that they may feel watchful. They may feel on guard or startled,\" she said. \"They need to know these are normal feelings, but they're also treatable feelings.\"</p> <p> The average age of the patient responding to the survey was 54, and the average time that had passed since their aortic dissection was about seven years, she said.</p> <p> The findings were presented Saturday at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions conference, in Chicago.</p> <p> While the study is one of only a few to look specifically at aortic dissection patients, related research has found that about 15 to 25 percent of heart attack and stroke survivors also screen positive for PTSD, said Donald Edmondson, director of Columbia University's Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health in New York City.</p> <p> An aortic dissection has all of the characteristics of a PTSD-inducing cardiovascular event, he said.</p> <p>\"Any type of event that is sudden onset, highly painful, and life-threatening has the potential to cause PTSD,\" said Edmondson, who was not involved in the new study. \"But what's unique and special about medical events like this is that unlike combat or sexual assault, where people can find a safe place where they're not at risk, someone who's had an aortic dissection or a heart attack or stroke can never get away from their heart (or brain).\"</p> <p> Edmondson said that heart attack survivors with PTSD are at double the risk of having another attack or dying within the next year than a survivor who is not under similar distress.</p> <p> There are two reasons for this, he said. One has to do with the body's natural reaction to stress. Just thinking about a traumatic event can make some people hyperventilate or become lightheaded.</p> <p>\"Often when people become aware of their physiological signals, like feeling short of breath, it distresses them. It makes them worry they're going to have another cardiovascular event, which of course makes their heart rate go faster,\" Edmondson said. \"That vicious cycle appears to contribute to secondary risk.\" </p> <p> Heart attack and stroke survivors with PTSD also are less likely to take medicine prescribed to help prevent future events. </p> <p>\"Their medications serve as reminders of their cardiovascular event and the fact that they're still at risk,\" Edmondson said. \"They try to avoid thinking about that, even though they think about it all the time.\"</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 14, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Strictly limiting carbohydrates and eating more fat may help the body burn more calories, a new clinical trial shows.</p><p>Researchers found that among 164 adults in a weight-loss study, those placed on a low-carb, high-fat diet burned more daily calories, versus those given high-carb meals. On average, their bodies used up 250 extra calories per day over 20 weeks.</p><p>The researchers estimated that over three years, that would translate into an additional 20-pound weight loss for an average-height man.</p><p>\"This study refutes the conventional thinking that it's only calorie-cutting that matters,\" said senior researcher Dr. David Ludwig. He is co-director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children's Hospital.</p><p>Instead, he said, the source of those calories may make the difference in whether your metabolism \"works with you or against you.\"</p><p>According to Ludwig, the findings support a theory called the \"carbohydrate-insulin model.\" The premise is that diets heavy in processed carbs send insulin levels soaring, which drives the body to use fewer calories, and instead store more of them as fat.</p><p>\"Our study suggests that you'll do better if you focus on reducing refined carbohydrates, rather than focusing on reducing calories alone,\" Ludwig said.</p><p>He and his colleagues reported the findings online Nov. 14 in the  <i>BMJ</i>.</p><p>Many studies over the years have attempted to answer the question of whether low-fat or low-carb is better for weight loss. Often, they've concluded there is little difference.</p><p>But those studies, Ludwig said, have typically been behavioral studies where people may or may not stick with their diets.</p><p>So his team conducted a \"feeding study\" to carefully control what people ate.</p><p>First, 234 overweight and obese adults were recruited for a \"run-in\" phase, with the goal of losing about 12 percent of their weight over 10 weeks. Their diets were low-calorie and had moderate amounts of carbs.</p><p>Of that group, 164 lost enough weight and moved on to the next phase. They were randomly assigned to either a low-carb, moderate-carb or high-carb diet for 20 weeks.</p><p>People on the low-carb diet got 20 percent of their calories from carbs like vegetables, fruits and beans; a full 60 percent of their calories came from fat, including sources like meat, whole milk, cheese and nuts. The remaining 20 percent of calories came from protein.</p><p>The situation was flipped for people on the high-carb plan: 60 percent of calories from carbs and 20 percent from fat. The moderate plan divided the two nutrients equally, at 40/40.</p><p>After 20 weeks, the low-carb group appeared to be burning more calories -- an average of 250 more per day, versus the high-carb group, and 111 more than the moderate-carb group.</p><p>The researchers did not look at the effects on any further weight loss. Instead, each person's calorie intake was calibrated to maintain what they'd already lost. The point, Ludwig explained, was to zero in on the effects of the different diets on calorie burning.</p><p>According to Dr. Anastassia Amaro, medical director of Penn Metabolic Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, \"The study design is very clever.\" </p><p>Amaro, who was not involved in the research, said she already suggests that patients cut back on carbs when they are trying to lose weight.</p><p>These findings, she said, will boost her confidence in that advice.</p><p>However, Amaro said, the low-carb diet used in this study is not ready for a \"direct translation\" into the real world. For one, she explained, it's not clear whether it's the lack of carbs that was key.</p><p>\"This is also a high-fat diet,\" Amaro pointed out. \"Is it the lack of carbs, the fat content, or both?\"</p><p>What about the nutritional value of such a diet? Ludwig said it's healthy -- allowing fruit, legumes and an \"unlimited\" amount of vegetables, for instance.</p><p>\"What it doesn't have is grains and added sugar,\" he said.</p><p>Ludwig agreed, however, that more research is needed to show whether the approach is the best way to maintain weight loss. He and his colleagues recently started a new trial that will pit a very low-carb diet against one that is high-carb but low in sugar, and another that is high-carb/high-sugar.</p><p>And what about people who currently have a healthy weight? Would a low-carb, high-fat diet cause their bodies to burn more calories?</p><p>That's a \"good question,\" Amaro said -- but this study can't answer it.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Harvard School of Public Health has more on <a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/carbohydrates/\" target=\"_new\">carbohydrates</a>.</p>",

Among the moms of babies who used pacifiers, 30 cleaned the pacifier by sterilization, 53 hand-washed the pacifier, and nine cleaned the pacifier by sucking it.</p><p>\"We found the children of mothers who sucked on the pacifier had lower IgE levels,\" said lead author Dr. Eliane Abou-Jaoude, from the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit.</p><p>IgE is a type of antibody related to allergic responses in the body.

Don't forget that certain foods can help protect your bones, a nutrition expert says.</p><p>\"Bone disease is often preventable by getting enough calcium and vitamin D into your diet,\" said Kathryn Weatherford, a registered dietitian at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.</p><p>\"By eating the right combination of calcium- and vitamin D-rich foods, we can boost our immune system and protect our bones,\" she said. \"Many foods are now fortified in calcium and vitamin D, making it easier to meet our daily recommended intake.\"</p><p>Start your day with a calcium-fortified cereal that is high in fiber (more than 3 grams) and low in sugar. Whole grain cereal with a cup of milk adds up to 600 milligrams (mg) of calcium.</p><p>Fatty fish is also an excellent source of vitamin D. A 3-ounce portion of wild salmon provides more than 100 percent of daily value of vitamin D, according to Weatherford.</p><p>Eat a variety of dark, leafy greens such as spinach, kale, Swiss chard and bok choy, she added.</p><p>An 8-ounce serving of yogurt provides 400 mg of calcium. Choose non-fat yogurt or Greek yogurt, which provides additional protein.</p><p>Another suggestion is milk alternatives. Whether it is almond, soy, cashew or hemp milk, almost all milk alternatives are fortified with both vitamin D and calcium. For example, almond milk provides up to 45 percent of daily value of calcium and 25 percent of daily value of vitamin D, Weatherford said.</p><p>Your body also produces vitamin D when exposed to sunlight. Just 10 to 15 minutes of sunshine a day can produce enough vitamin D.</p><p>It's important to monitor how much calcium and vitamin D you consume each day. If you suspect you're not getting enough, talk to your doctor or dietitian, Weatherford suggested.</p><p>\"It's good to know if you're vitamin D-deficient so you can take steps to fix the problem and keep building strong bones,\" Weatherford said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Library of Medicine has more on <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002405.htm\" target=\"_new\">vitamin D</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Oct. 25, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Although this flu season is off to a slow start, U.S. health officials are urging everyone to get vaccinated now.</p><p>Why? Last year was one of the worst flu seasons on record, yet fewer Americans got a flu shot than in years past. In fact, less than four in 10 adults were protected against flu and its complications last winter, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>\"Right now flu activity is low, with just a smattering of cases,\" said Dr. Alicia Fry. She is chief of the epidemiology and prevention branch in the CDC's influenza division.</p><p>\"Now is the perfect time to get vaccinated &hellip; it gives your body enough time to respond to the vaccine and mount a good immune response so you're ready for the flu season,\" Fry said.</p><p>October is the best time to get a flu shot. The vaccine reduces your odds of influenza, and if you get the flu it makes it much milder, she added.</p><p>The vaccine also reduces deaths among children, as well as hospitalizations among pregnant women, Fry said.</p><p>The vaccine is particularly important for women who have children too young to get a flu shot, people aged 65 and older, and anyone with chronic heart or lung disease.</p> <p>About 132 million doses of the vaccine have been distributed so far, and about 168 million will be available through the 2018-2019 flu season, according to Fry.</p><p>Several viruses are circulating, including influenza A strains H1N1 and H3N2, and two influenza B viruses. \"It's not clear if there is going to be one virus that's going to win and be the dominant virus,\" she noted.</p><p>Fry said she hopes this flu season will be milder than the last, \"but we can't predict that.\"</p><p>Last flu season saw record numbers of deaths and hospitalizations. The CDC estimates that the flu sickened 49 million, hospitalized nearly 1 million and killed 79,000.</p><p>Nearly 12 million children came down with the flu, and 48,000 were hospitalized, CDC statistics show. Of those, 183 died. Among those aged 18 to 64, 30 million were sickened and 10,300 died.</p><p>In all, 70 percent of those hospitalized for flu were aged 65 and older, as were 90 percent of those who died, according to the CDC.</p><p>Last year was the worst season since 2009 when the pandemic H1N1 flu virus hit, health officials said. </p><p>This year's vaccine should be a better match to the circulating virus than last year's, Fry noted. </p><p>For H1N1, the vaccine is up to 60 percent effective, as it is for the influenza B viruses. For the H3N2 virus it's less effective, since H3 viruses can change to fool the body's immune system, she explained.</p><p>This year, the H3N2 virus component of the vaccine has been tweaked to better match the circulating strain, Fry added.</p><p>\"The vaccine is the best protection against getting the flu or being hospitalized or dying from flu,\" she stressed. </p><p>The flu activity report was published Oct. 26 in the CDC's <i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">the flu</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Dec. 7, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Hot flashes, a common curse in menopause, can be especially bothersome after breast cancer. But a new study suggests an existing medication may help.</p><p>The drug is oxybutynin (Ditropan XL), long  used to treat urinary incontinence.</p><p>The study found that women taking the medicine had an average of five fewer hot flashes a week, compared with three fewer among women taking a placebo.  </p><p>\"Oxybutynin is an option that can control these symptoms and improve quality of life,\" said lead researcher Dr. Roberto Leon-Ferre, an assistant professor of oncology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.</p><p>There are a couple of reasons for severe hot flashes after breast cancer. Chemotherapy may induce early menopause, and drugs that reduce estrogen levels may make hot flashes worse, the research team noted.  </p><p>Hormone replacement therapy, which is often recommended for menopausal symptoms, is generally not advised for breast cancer survivors. That's left women who can't take hormones at a disadvantage.</p><p>Oxybutynin blocks a substance in the brain, and one of its side effects is decreased sweating, Leon-Ferre noted. </p><p>\"Because of this, we can take advantage of the 'side effect' and decrease involuntary sweating associated with hot flashes, and decrease the hot flashes as well,\" he explained.</p><p>The drug could be game-changing for certain women, said Dr. Alice Police, regional director of breast surgery at Northwell Health Cancer Institute in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y.</p><p>\"This is a really important advance in survivorship and compassionate cancer care,\" added Police, who wasn't involved in the study.</p><p>Because oxybutynin is already available for other conditions, Leon-Ferre said doctors could prescribe it off-label.</p><p>However, he cautioned that its long-term effects aren't known. Drugs in this class -- called anticholinergics -- have been linked with mental decline, he said. </p><p>For example, the drugs may raise the risk for problems with short-term memory, reasoning and confusion, and may also hike the risk for dementia among older patients, studies indicate.</p><p>For the new study, Leon-Ferre and his colleagues randomly assigned 150 women who experienced at least 28 hot flashes a week to oxybutynin or a placebo. </p><p>Almost two-thirds were also taking drugs to prevent a return of breast cancer, either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor.</p><p>The women were randomly assigned to one of three groups: low-dose oxybutynin twice a day for six weeks; low-dose oxybutynin for one week followed by an increased dose; or a placebo. </p><p>Both doses appeared to reduce hot flashes better than the placebo.</p><p>And oxybutynin doesn't interfere with the metabolism of tamoxifen, Leon-Ferre said, calling that an important consideration for breast cancer survivors.</p><p>Most insurance covers oxybutynin, and a month's supply can range from $21 to $42. With insurance, copays would be less, he added. </p><p>Side effects included constipation, mild diarrhea, dry mouth, dry eyes, episodes of confusion and difficulty urinating, the researchers found. </p><p>Women taking oxybutynin also reported improvement in work, social activities, leisure activities, sleep and overall quality of life.</p><p>These are vital issues, Police said. \"I will never forget the first time a patient said, 'Thank you for curing my breast cancer, but you ruined my life,' \" she said.</p><p>The patient said endocrine therapy had caused hot flashes so severe that she could not sleep. As a result, she was having trouble at work and in all other aspects of her life, Police recalled.</p> <p>\"Her intimate relationship was also suffering, as nighttime had become a battleground between her and her internal temperature control,\" Police said. </p><p>The patient said she was willing to stop her hormone therapy and risk the return of breast cancer rather than live with her current symptoms, she said.</p><p>\"This study makes me hopeful that these patients may have a way out of their dilemma,\" Police said. \"Instead of just telling them they should be happy to be alive, we may be able to offer a reliable treatment for some of the debilitating side effects of our treatments for breast cancer.\"  </p><p>The research was scheduled to be presented Friday at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in Texas. Studies presented at meetings are usually considered preliminary until peer-reviewed for publication in a medical journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Cancer Institute has more about  <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/hot-flashes-hp-pdq\" target=\"_new\">hot flashes and cancer survivors</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, April 25, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- The idea behind immunotherapy for peanut allergy is appealing in its simplicity: Ask a patient to eat tiny amounts of peanut every day, and over time their immune system will become desensitized to it.</p><p>Unfortunately, this cure might be doing more harm than the allergy itself, a new evidence review suggests.</p><p>People who undergo immunotherapy for their peanut allergies wind up with a large increase in life-threatening anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions, compared to others who either avoid peanuts or are in a placebo group, researchers concluded.</p><p>Peanut immunotherapy triples a patient's risk of anaphylaxis and doubles the chances they'll need to use epinephrine to counter a severe allergic reaction.</p><p>\"We found that patients on immunotherapy, their quality of life wasn't any better,\" said lead researcher Dr. Derek Chu, a fellow in clinical immunology at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada. \"Outside of the clinic, they actually end up having more allergic reactions over time.\"</p><p>Chu's team discovered this troubling fact after pooling results of 12 peanut immunotherapy trials involving more than 1,000 patients.</p><p>\"If you looked at each study one by one, you might not see that,\" Chu said. \"When you combine them all, and you analyze all 1,000 patients in unison, then you can actually see it.\"</p><p>Food allergies affect more than 6 million people, including as many as 8&#37; of children and 3&#37; of adults, researchers said in background notes. Although most kids outgrow allergies to milk or eggs, peanut allergies are lifelong in up to 85&#37; of cases.</p><p>Symptoms can run from runny nose, hives and itching to a tightening of the throat and shortness of breath. Severe reactions can result in anaphylactic shock, which requires immediate treatment with an epinephrine injector and a trip to the emergency room, the Mayo Clinic says.</p><p>Right now, immunotherapy is the only available treatment for severe food allergies, and it has been shown to increase a person's tolerance, Chu said.</p><p>\"There haven't been any other options than avoidance to date, so it's very promising we have something that partially works,\" he said.</p><p>But these results show the price paid for increased tolerance might be too high.</p><p>\"The therapy itself needs to be very carefully reconsidered,\" Chu said. \"That level of protection you get from going through the procedure is variable and often incomplete. Day-to-day, the degree of protection can change, and if you have an infection or an illness or maybe you're just tired that day, you can have a reaction to a dose you previously tolerated.\"</p><p>The 12 clinical trials occurred in the United States, United Kingdom, Europe and Australia. The average age of participants was about 9 years old, and patients were typically followed for a year.</p><p>People undergoing peanut immunotherapy had a 22&#37; risk of anaphylaxis, compared with 7&#37; for untreated peanut allergy sufferers, researchers found.</p><p>The chance that a peanut immunotherapy patient would require an epinephrine injection is about 8&#37;, compared to about 4&#37; for those not receiving treatment.</p><p>Allergic reactions involving the gastrointestinal tract, skin, nose and lungs also increased.</p><p>Researchers concluded that folks might want to simply avoid peanuts rather than undergo immunotherapy if they want to prevent anaphylaxis and allergic reactions.</p><p>The new evidence review was published online April 25 in <i>The Lancet</i>.</p><p>While these findings are food for thought, it's too early to completely count out immunotherapy, said Dr. Scott Sicherer, director of the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. He wasn't involved with the study.</p><p>\"Although this is a very important paper pointing out a major issue with this particular approach, it's not the end of the story,\" Sicherer said. \"It's still a viable approach. It does change the threshold for a majority of patients. But it requires a discussion between the doctor and the patient of the risks and benefits.\"</p><p>Sicherer noted that there is no immunotherapy for food approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Allergy doctors instead create their own \"home brew\" for patients, providing either tiny amounts of the food or capsules containing refined versions of the allergen.</p><p>That's one problem with current immunotherapy practice, Chu said.</p><p>\"Anytime we take something that's completely natural, and we distill it and put it in a capsule, that's a drug now,\" he said. \"That's not just something as simple as an off-the-shelf product anymore.\"</p><p>Sicherer's center doesn't offer immunotherapy as a regular clinical option, because the treatment is not FDA-approved, he said.</p><p>Assuming it ever gets approved, he envisions a conversation where he'd discuss the risks and benefits with a child's caregivers.</p><p>\"This is a therapy where there's a two-thirds chance it's going to increase the amount of peanut your child can eat before reaction, but going onto this therapy on average results in more anaphylaxis and allergic reactions than if you didn't go on this therapy,\" Sicherer said.</p><p>The therapy would reduce the chances of an accidental allergic reaction caused by traces of peanut winding up in a restaurant meal, but there also could be an out-of-the-blue reaction to the therapy itself, he said.</p><p>Chu and Sicherer agreed better treatments are needed.</p><p>And that might be on the way. Earlier this month, researchers announced a potential medication for peanut allergy that would halt violent reactions by blocking the immune system's antibodies from responding to the allergen. It was published in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>.</p><p>\"There's a lot of promise from a lot of different approaches, and I would imagine that we're going to end up in a place,  hopefully not too long from now, where we could say, there's seven different options and looking at your situation the best is this one or that one,\" Sicherer said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Stanford University has more about <a href=\"http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2018/11/5-questions-progress-in-peanut-allergy-immunotherapy.html\" target=\"_new\">peanut immunotherapy</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, April 9, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- A new method of brewing a cancer vaccine <i>inside</i> a patient's tumor could harness the power of the immune system to destroy the disease, researchers report.</p><p>Immune stimulants are injected directly into a tumor, which teaches the immune system to recognize and destroy all similar cancer cells throughout the body, said senior researcher Dr. Joshua Brody. He is director of the Lymphoma Immunotherapy Program at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.</p><p>\"We're injecting two immune stimulants right into one single tumor,\" Brody said. \"We inject one tumor and we see all of the other tumors just melt away.\"</p><p>Eight out of 11 lymphoma patients in a small,  early clinical trial experienced partial or complete destruction of the tumor that received the initial injection, according to the report published April 8 in the journal <i>Nature Medicine</i>.</p><p>The vaccine also halted overall cancer progression in six patients for three to 18 months, and caused significant regression or actual remission in three patients, the investigators found.</p><p>The results were solid enough that the research team is expanding its next clinical trial to include lymphoma, breast, and head and neck cancer patients, Brody said. That trial started in March.</p><p>Prior efforts at unleashing the immune system to fight cancer have focused on T-cells, which Brody calls the \"soldiers\" of the immune army because they directly attack harmful invaders in the body.</p><p>Drugs called checkpoint inhibitors help T-cells identify cancer cells as the bad guys and kill them off.</p><p>\"We call them the 'Jimmy Carter' medicines because that's what Jimmy got when he had very advanced-stage melanoma,\" Brody said.</p><p>But the checkpoint inhibitors have typically only been able to help about one in five cancer patients significantly, \"so there's lots of room for improvement,\" he added.</p><p>This new vaccine approach focuses on dendritic cells, which Brody calls the \"generals\" of the immune system's army. Dendritic cells guide the response of T-cells to fight off invaders.</p><p>\"We're trying to mobilize these immune generals to tell the soldiers what to do,\" Brody said.</p><p>Patients first received nine daily injections of an immune stimulant intended to \"recruit\" dendritic cells by teaching them how to recognize cancerous cells, the study authors said.</p><p>The patients then received eight injections of a second stimulant that \"activates\" the dendritic cells, prompting them to instruct T-cells to hunt and destroy the now revealed cancer cells in the body.</p><p>Essentially, the method turns the injected tumor into a cancer vaccine factory, the researchers explained.</p><p>The approach differs from traditional vaccines for the flu or measles because those are preventive, teaching the body beforehand how to fight off an infectious disease, Brody pointed out.</p><p>This vaccine is therapeutic. \"We're trying to teach the immune system to get rid of the thing even after you've already got the problem,\" he said.</p><p>Lab tests involving mice show that this vaccine approach could be at least three times more powerful if combined with checkpoint inhibitors, Brody added.</p><p>Because of this, patients in the new trial will receive both the vaccine and checkpoint inhibitors, the researchers said.</p><p>Susanna Greer, scientific director of clinical cancer research and immunology for the American Cancer Society, said that \"priming\" dendritic cells inside a person's tumor to produce the best anti-tumor immune response \"suggests a promising immunotherapy strategy.\"</p><p>\"Additional human studies are warranted to confirm these findings,\" Greer said.</p><p>Dr. Catherine Diefenbach, director of clinical lymphoma at the NYU Langone Perlmutter Cancer Center in New York City, said the vaccine approach is \"novel and extremely interesting,\" and could help explain why checkpoint inhibitors usually don't help patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</p><p>However, she noted that really only three of the 11 patients in the initial clinical trial had truly meaningful responses to the vaccine.</p><p>\"These are indolent lymphoma patients,\" said Diefenbach, an expert for the American Society of Clinical Oncology. \"The fact there was stable disease doesn't really mean anything because these cancers don't grow fast.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Cancer Society has more about <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/treatment-types/immunotherapy/what-is-immunotherapy.html\" target=\"_new\">cancer immunotherapy</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 6, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Gavin Kuykendall's life has been shaped by his fight against heart disease. Now almost 12, he recently expressed all he's been through -- by writing a letter to his heart disease.</p> <p>\"You made my parents very sad,\" he said, reading his letter in a video. \"You tried to make my birthday an overwhelming and unhappy day. Even though you made me incredibly sick, I was brave, I was strong.\"</p> <p>Like all first-time parents-to-be, Faith and Adam Kuykendall were looking forward to their 20-week ultrasound and the chance to take another peek at their unborn child. </p> <p>\"Everything was going great until the doctor got to the heart,\" Faith said. \"You could just see his face drop and he said, 'Oh no.' \"</p> <p>Tests showed their son had a rare condition in which the left ventricle doesn't develop properly. It's called hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). The left ventricle is responsible for pumping freshly oxygenated blood out to the rest of the body.</p> <p>Without immediate intervention, HLHS is fatal, usually within days or weeks.</p> <p>Such specialized care wasn't available in their hometown of Tulsa. Their frequent medical appointments and the delivery would need to be in Oklahoma City, nearly two hours away.</p> <p>Gavin arrived after 28 hours of labor. Although Faith and Adam had been warned they could see a child \"blue and limp or not breathing,\" he came out screaming -- a great sign.</p> <p>Four days later, Gavin underwent open-heart surgery to create a way for the right ventricle to pump blood to both the lungs and the body. Doctors implanted a shunt that directs blood to the lungs.</p> <p>Doctors left the incision open for a few days until the swelling subsided.</p> <p>\"That was the worst,\" Faith said. \"He was naked and swollen. You could literally see his heart beating in his chest.\"</p> <p>Gavin remained in the hospital for a month. Four months later, it was time for a second procedure.</p> <p>Typically, this one is easier on the child. But Gavin \"wasn't eating, his left side wasn't functioning, and he was shaking,\" Faith said.</p> <p>Doctors discovered that not only had Gavin suffered a stroke during surgery, he'd become addicted to the powerful narcotics he'd been given. He was going through withdrawal, for which he was treated with methadone.</p> <p>Those first few years were tough for the Kuykendalls. Family, their church community and others in their support system helped them persevere, providing meals and ensuring that someone was always with Gavin. </p> <p>\"We even had a family CPR class so everyone would know what to do, just in case,\" Faith said.</p> <p>Their network came through again in 2009, when it was time for a third surgery.</p> <p>The surgeon who'd cared for Gavin had left Oklahoma for San Diego, leaving their home state without anyone capable of performing the operation. </p> <p>Friends and family helped raise the needed funds to travel to San Diego to stay with the same doctor. And all went well. At 2 1/2, Gavin's heart was rebuilt to the best of expectations. A few months later, Gavin became a big brother. Brody was born, thankfully with a well-formed heart. </p> <p>\"That kid is a walking comedian,\" Faith said. \"I think God knew we needed that.\"</p> <p>Gavin was 5 1/2 when he began facing more complications. Doctors determined he needed a pacemaker to help his heart beat in a regular rhythm. The family again returned to San Diego for the surgery.</p> <p>Around the same time, a close friend of the Kuykendalls -- Brandon Weeden -- was selected in the first round of the National Football League draft. Brandon's wife, Melanie, and Adam had worked together just out of college, and the couples had become close friends. </p> <p>The Weedens were disappointed to learn that the state of Oklahoma lacked the specialists to operate on Gavin and other children. So after signing his NFL contract, Weeden started a foundation, which in turn helped establish a cardiac surgery research program at The Children's Hospital in Oklahoma City.</p> <p>\"I have so much respect for Gavin and the whole family,\" said Weeden, who now plays for the Houston Texans. \"He's already been through more in his lifetime than I'll ever go through. We have birthdays a day apart and try to celebrate together. I just think the world of him.\"</p> <p>Gavin is now in sixth grade and plays right field on his baseball team. Although he also loves football, he's not allowed to play contact sports. </p> <p>\"Of course he wants to do what all the other boys are doing, and that's a struggle,\" Faith said. \"Although he has some anxieties, and some physical and intellectual limitations, I don't want him to think that heart disease defines him. Luckily, he is the most determined, strong-willed child.\"</p> <p>Gavin said he's particularly proud of inspiring Weeden's foundation to help other children in Oklahoma. </p> <p>\"I want people to know that no matter what you have, or what you feel like, you're not alone,\" Gavin said. \"You can do this.\"</p>",

The causes of the condition remain unclear, but many patients say their condition began after their immune system fought off an infection.</p><p>One problem in trying to determine the causes of chronic fatigue syndrome is that it's impossible to assess patients before the illness develops. In this study, researchers used a model for chronic fatigue syndrome based on the hepatitis C treatment interferon-alpha.</p><p>Interferon-alpha triggers immune system activity in much the same way as a major infection does, the study authors explained in a college news release. Many patients who receive interferon-alpha develop acute fatigue during treatment and some have fatigue that lasts for more than six months after treatment ends.</p><p>In the new study, the researchers assessed fatigue and immune system activity in 55 patients before, during and after treatment with interferon-alpha. The investigators discovered differences between the immune systems of 18 patients who developed long-term fatigue and those who had a normal recovery.</p><p>Those 18 patients had a much stronger immune response during treatment with interferon-alpha, with a doubling in the levels of immune system messenger molecules called interleukin-10 and interleukin-6, according to the report.</p><p>Even before treatment started, levels of interleukin-10 were higher among the 18 patients who later developed long-term fatigue, suggesting the immune system may have been primed to overreact, the study authors explained.</p><p>Yet, there was no difference before treatments between the groups in their levels of fatigue or in psychiatric symptoms, like depression or recent stressful events, the scientists noted.</p><p>The study findings were published Dec. 17 in the journal <i>Psychoneuroendocrinology</i>.</p> <p>According to senior researcher Carmine Pariante, \"A better understanding of the biology underlying the development of CFS is needed to help patients suffering with this debilitating condition. Although screening tests are a long way off, our results are the first step in identifying those at risk and catching the illness in its crucial early stages.\"</p><p>Further research is needed to confirm that the findings from patients treated with interferon-alpha would also apply to people with chronic fatigue syndrome, and to better understand the factors that may be driving an exaggerated immune response, the study authors said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Office on Women's Health has more on <a href=\"https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/chronic-fatigue-syndrome\" target=\"_new\">chronic fatigue syndrome</a>.</p>",

She is an assistant professor with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.</p><p>\"That itself, even if you don't lose weight, is going to lead to beneficial changes that end up leading to you having a longer life span,\" Liu said.</p><p>The study findings were presented Saturday at the  American Heart Association annual meeting, in Chicago. Research presented at meetings should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>Previous research has shown that higher fitness is associated with lower risk of heart-related death, even in the obese, Liu said. It's also been shown that people who are obese-but-fit can have a comparable life span to fit people of normal weight.</p><p>For the  new study, Liu and her colleagues compared two different groups of obese people who participated in the Dallas Heart Study, a long-term research effort aimed at improving diagnosis, prevention and treatment of heart disease.</p><p>The investigators used data gathered for the study to identify nearly 1,100 participants with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more, which is the technical definition of obesity.</p><p>The researchers then sorted the obese people based on stress tests that revealed their VO2 max, a measurement of the maximum amount of oxygen a person can utilize during intense exercise.</p><p>There were 716 people who qualified as obese and fit based on stress tests, and 356 qualified as obese and unfit.</p><p>Obese-but-fit people had 44 percent lower pulse rates, 37 percent better heart function and 43 percent lower body fat than those who were obese and unfit, the findings showed. The obese-but-fit participants also had BMIs that were 37 percent lower than those who didn't work out.</p><p>These results should be encouraging to people who started exercising to lose weight but have been unable to keep losing it, Liu said.</p><p>\"The majority of the people reach a plateau where they no longer lose weight even though they're still active and exercising, and trying to build up their fitness,\" Liu said. \"At that point, even if you stay the same weight, you're still gaining the benefits of having higher fitness.\"</p><p>Much of the benefit these people gain is from increasing their lean muscle mass, said Dr. Salim Virani, an associate professor of cardiology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.</p> <p>Muscle weighs more than fat, and it provides a significant boost to your metabolism, said Virani, chair of the American College of Cardiology's Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease Council.</p><p>\"Muscles are very good at taking care of excess sugars in your blood,\" decreasing your risk of diabetes and its heart-related complications, Virani explained.</p><p>\"Even if you are obese, there is a lot of hope by becoming physically fit,\" Virani said. \"Just being physically active adds a lot of mileage in terms of cardiovascular health. It's not all about losing weight.

Reading over the findings, he said that \"we are starting to understand more and more the concept of stress-induced heart disease, otherwise known as 'broken heart syndrome.' This study shows an association between one such stressor, bullying, and the heart disease.\"</p><p> Reisinger said it makes sense that workplace stressors can tax the heart.</p><p>He  explained that, like many other animals, humans can be stressed into a state of \"arousal\" that, if constant, can do cardiovascular harm.  Workplace bullying, especially, can perpetuate this stressed state \"into our home, recreation, sleep and vacations.\"</p><p>Bosses are the usual sources of this stress, and \"from a human resources perspective, people are said to leave their boss, not their job,\" Reisinger said.  \"Their boss is the person central to maintaining or promoting or ignoring workplace incivility.\"</p><p>But even if you are unfortunate to have a bullying boss, there are ways to cope.</p><p>\"Stress-reduction skills training include such techniques as progressive muscle relaxation, mindfulness skills training, cognitive behavioral skills training, biofeedback, yoga and similar skills,\" Reisinger said. \"These can go a long way in calming your reactions to a hostile work environment.\"</p><p>The findings were published Nov. 18 in the <i>European Heart Journal</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart Association offers advice on <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/how-to-help-prevent-heart-disease-at-any-age\" target=\"_new\">heart disease prevention</a>.</p>",

The mammograms took place at 150 facilities in 31 states in the United States.</p><p>The researchers looked at women aged 30 to 39 with three specific risk factors -- dense breasts, prior diagnosis of breast cancer, or breast cancer in a first-degree relative (mother, sister or daughter).</p><p>The investigators compared the results of mammography in these women against mammograms given to women aged 40 to 49 without those risk factors.</p><p>Breast cancer was detected about as often in younger women with these risk factors as in women in their 40s, the researchers found.</p><p>They also determined that women in their 30s with breast cancer risk factors have to come back to the doctor for further testing and biopsy about as often as older women undergoing regular screening.</p><p>\"Women with at least one of these three risk factors likely benefit from screening mammogram beginning at age 30, instead of age 40,\" Lee said.</p><p>The findings were to be presented Wednesday at the Radiological Society of North America annual meeting, in Chicago. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>A breast cancer risk assessment and possible initiation of mammograms at age 30 doesn't necessarily run counter to current screening guidelines, said Robert Smith, vice president of cancer screening for the American Cancer Society.</p><p>\"The ACS guidelines for women at higher risk already recommend breast cancer screening before age 40 if a woman is a carrier of a known or suspected mutation on a breast cancer susceptibility gene, or if she was exposed to radiation treatment for childhood cancer,\" Smith said. </p><p>\"Likewise, women and their doctors can make individual decisions. So if a woman has a family history in a first-degree relative diagnosed before the age of 50, it is not unreasonable for her to seek advice about whether she should begin screening before age 50,\" he said.</p><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation on breast cancer screening also includes some flexibility, saying that the decision to start regular mammography before age 50 \"should be an individual one and take patient context into account.\"</p><p>Smith added that mammograms for women who've already had breast cancer shouldn't really be regarded as screening.</p><p>\"If a woman has prior history of breast cancer, her regular exams are dictated by that experience,\" Smith said. \"Any woman diagnosed with breast cancer will undergo regular surveillance breast imaging from that point forward.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has more about <a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/UpdateSummaryFinal/breast-cancer-screening1?ds=1&s=mammography\" target=\"_new\">breast cancer screening</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Dec. 3, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- More than one-quarter of people with diabetes have skimped on needed insulin because of the drug's soaring price tag, according to a new small study. </p><p>Surveying nearly 200 Americans with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, researchers found 26 percent had underused insulin because of cost.</p><p>But insulin isn't a drug you can safely ration, doctors warn. </p><p>\"For people with type 1 diabetes, insulin is a lifesaving drug. Without it, people can die within days,\" said the study's lead author, Dr. Kasia Lipska, an assistant professor of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine. </p><p>\"About 1 in 5 people with type 2 need insulin to prevent short-term and long-term complications, like blindness, kidney failure and dialysis and heart disease,\" Lipska explained. </p><p>Dr. LaShawn McIver is senior vice president of government affairs and advocacy for the American Diabetes Association (ADA).</p><p>\"People are struggling to afford insulin, and it truly is a life-and-death situation,\" she said. </p><p>A recent survey by the diabetes association found a similar number of people -- 27 percent in their study -- said cost had affected their use or purchase of insulin. Many of them were regularly taking less than their doctor prescribed, were missing doses or switching to a different insulin. </p><p>Insulin costs have gone up dramatically, said Dr. Elisabeth Rosenthal, author of a journal editorial. Both the new study and editorial were published Dec. 3 in <i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p>\"Between 2007 and 2017, the average wholesale price of four of the most popular insulins has more than tripled in price,\" wrote Rosenthal, editor-in-chief of Kaiser Health News. </p><p>\"Between 2010 and 2015, the monthly wholesale price of Humulin, the most popular insulin, rose to nearly $1,100, up from $258 for the average patient,\" she added. </p><p>These skyrocketing prices put a considerable strain on people with type 1 diabetes, who are often young people just getting started in their lives, Rosenthal said. </p><p>Lipska said it's important to be able to quantify the extent of the problem, hence the study. </p><p>The researchers surveyed 199 people with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. All had been prescribed insulin in the past six months. </p><p>Because of cost, 32 percent of those between ages 18 and 44 reported underusing insulin, as did 24 percent of those 44 to 64 years old. Among those 64 and older, 21 percent had underused insulin due to cost. </p><p>Moreover, more than one-third of those who underused insulin never spoke to their physician about it. </p><p>Insulin underuse based on cost wasn't limited to low-wage earners. While nearly 20 percent of people making under $10,000 a year reported skimping on insulin due to cost, so did more than 38 percent of those making between $50,000 and $99,000 a year, the study reported. </p><p>\"People are struggling to afford insulin across all incomes,\" McIver said. </p><p>\"When an unexpected bill lands in your mailbox, it's a crisis, and we hear a lot about the $200,000 bills. But insulin and insulin pump costs, and blood sugar test strips, these costs are persistent, and they're for life,\" Rosenthal said. \"Imagine if your rent suddenly went up $600 a month. It's really unfair to people who have type 1 diabetes.\" </p><p>The new study also found that more than half of people surveyed said they were also having trouble paying for diabetes devices, such as insulin pumps, blood sugar meters and continuous glucose monitors. </p><p>And those cost issues made a difference. People who reported cost-related insulin underuse had three times higher odds of having poor blood sugar control, the study found. </p><p>Lipska and her colleagues agreed said this problem is too big for patients to tackle on their own. </p><p>\"Regulators and the medical community need to intervene to ensure that insulin is affordable to patients who need it,\" they wrote. </p><p>McIver said the ADA is pushing for more transparency across the supply chain to help figure out why costs have gotten so high. She encouraged patients to call their elected officials and share their stories and concerns. </p><p>Lipska said physicians need to be aware that pricing is an issue for their patients. \"Doctors need to talk to their patients and ask them. Patients feel that this isn't a medical issue per se, and may not bring it up. But if you can't afford your medicine, that's part of your care.\" </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>If you can't afford your insulin, the American Diabetes Association suggests possible <a href=\"https://makeinsulinaffordable.org/resources/\" target=\"_new\">resources</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 6, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Brown-bag lunches give you control over what you eat and what your children eat, but studies show that these to-go meals need to be healthier. This is especially important for kids because their eating habits are developed during the preschool years.</p><p>Recent studies have evaluated lunches for preschoolers by comparing their contents to the Healthy Eating Index, which is used to assess how well recommended nutrition guidelines are being followed. The conclusion: there's a lot of room for improvement.</p><p>Out of a possible 100 points, the lunches scored just 52 based on what kids actually ate (lunches as packed were slightly higher, at 58, based on how healthy they were to begin with). Scores were lowest for vegetables, especially greens, followed by seafood, whole grains and plant proteins. While other protein foods and fruit were well represented, foods with empty calories took the top spot.</p><p>So what can you do?</p><p>Start by making small changes to give taste buds time to adjust. Instead of white bread or rolls, switch to 100 percent whole wheat. Or try a wrap -- both you and your kids might find it more fun to eat, and it's easier to sneak in veggies in place of processed cheese slices, for instance.</p><p>Next, ditch pre-sliced deli meats in favor of fresh chicken breast or turkey -- you can roast your own on Sunday and carve slices for lunches throughout the week. Try mashed avocado to add creaminess in place of mayo. Pre-washed and sliced veggies are a timesaver, but if you're on a tight budget, wash and cut them up yourself in advance. One of the healthiest substitutions is replacing a bag of chips with an ounce of nuts if there aren't any nut allergies.</p><p>Also, stock up on essentials like reusable containers and a thermos, great for packing soups and stews, which can also be made in advance. In short order, you'll find that these translate into a money savings compared to the extra cost of buying single-serving packages of snacks and other foods.</p><p>And be sure to get kids involved in the menu planning and prep. They'll be more inclined to eat what they help make and pack.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Health's \"We Can!\" program has more ideas for <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/wecan/downloads/tip-school-lunches.pdf\" target=\"_new\">healthy school lunches</a> that kids will enjoy.</p>",

If you can't get outside, consider using a sun therapy light. Be sure you get enough vitamin D in your diet or take a multivitamin.</li><li>Get plenty of exercise. If you can't get outdoors, try a gym or walk the halls at work or at a mall. Exercise benefits both mind and body.</li><li>Plan stress-free family time.

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY,  Sept. 18, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Thousands of Americans struggling with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may have a new treatment option to help them breathe easier.</p><p>COPD, which is often linked to smoking, is a progressive deterioration of lung function that involves a combination of bronchitis and emphysema symptoms. It's the third leading cause of death in the United States, and while treatments can ease symptoms, there is no cure for COPD.</p><p>However, researchers on Tuesday presented promising new findings from a phase 2 clinical trial. The trial focused on a new COPD treatment called targeted lung denervation (TLD).</p><p> In this therapy, doctors disrupt nerves lying on the outside of the patients' airways.</p><p>The new trial involved 82 COPD patients treated at medical centers in six European countries. According to the researchers, the treatment reduced problematic symptoms by more than 50 percent compared to patients who got a sham treatment.</p><p>\"We have been able to significantly reduce chronic respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, exacerbations of the disease, infections and hospitalizations in a group of COPD patients who are already on aggressive medical therapy,\" said lead researcher Dr. Dirk-Jan Slebos, of the University Medical Centre Groningen, in the Netherlands. </p><p>In addition, patients saw a better quality of life and improved lung function, he said.</p><p>One expert in respiratory care said new treatment options are needed for COPD patients.</p><p>Dr. Len Horovitz is a pulmonary specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He explained that TLD works by inactivating nerves lying outside the airways.  This results \"in dilatation of previously constricted airways, and less production of mucous,\" he explained.</p><p>\"While there is medication that COPD patients use to accomplish the same effect, the addition of TLD appears to confer additional therapeutic benefit,\" said Horovitz, who wasn't involved in the new trial.</p><p>The study was funded by Nuvaira, the Minneapolis-based maker of TLD technology. The findings were scheduled for presentation Tuesday at the European Respiratory Society International Congress, in Paris.</p><p>In the treatment, a catheter is passed through a tube called a bronchoscope into the lungs. The catheter delivers an electric charge to the nerves on the outside of the airways, altering their normal function.</p><p>This allows the airways to relax and widen, make less mucus and also eases inflammation to the airway wall. The catheter and bronchoscope are then removed.</p><p>When combined with drugs designed to relax the airway, TLD appears to have an even greater effect, the researchers said.</p><p>Among the 82 patients in the trial, the investigators found that in the six months after the procedure, 71 percent of those who received the sham treatment experienced a serious flare-up of their COPD, compared with only 32 percent of those who were treated with TLD.</p><p>\"Furthermore, the positive benefit has continued in those receiving TLD treatment, with the number of patients hospitalized for respiratory complications in the first year reduced by more than half in the treatment arm versus the sham arm,\" Slebos said in a meeting news release. </p><p>The study team reported that no patients died. Among those receiving TLD, five patients experienced side effects that included nausea, abdominal bloating and digestion discomfort. These problems were short-lived and gone within six months.</p><p>According to Horovitz, the invasive nature of the procedure may not make TLD appropriate for all COPD patients. \"This procedure would be contemplated in patients who are very symptomatic with shortness of breath and frequent exacerbations,\" he said.</p><p>A much larger, phase 3 trial is being planned for 2019, the researchers said.</p><p>Experts note that research presented at medical meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more about COPD, visit the <a href=\"http://www.lung.org/lung-health-and-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/copd/learn-about-copd/\" target=\"_new\"> American Lung Association</a>.</p>",

She is program director in the College of Humanities and Sciences at the University of Phoenix.</p><p>\"However, for veterans, that has not translated into a shift in the perception of mental health. Many of our veterans served in a culture where talking about your feelings or seeking help was not widely accepted,\" she added in a university news release.</p><p>The recently released survey results bear that out: More than 90 percent of all veterans and active-duty service members said mental health is as important as physical health. But only 30 percent of veterans have sought or considered mental health counseling, compared with 72 percent of active-duty service members.</p><p>This difference may be because veterans retain old stereotypes and stigmas associated with mental health counseling, the researchers noted.</p><p>The survey also found that 89 percent of active-duty military members believe people who receive professional counseling generally get somewhat or a lot better, compared with 66 percent of veterans.</p><p>In addition, 91 percent of active-duty service members say their leaders openly discuss the importance of dealing with mental health concerns, while only 23 percent of veterans say that their leaders did so.</p><p>When veterans were asked what resources they would use to manage mental health, free counseling was the most common response  (39 percent).</p><p>Fifty-eight percent of veterans said they would be encouraged to seek mental health counseling if a close colleague, friend or family member discussed their experiences receiving counseling.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Mental Health has more on <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies/index.shtml\" target=\"_new\">counseling</a>.</p>",

Spindle is a postdoctoral research fellow at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, in Baltimore.</p><p>These vaporizers aren't to be confused with \"vaping\" -- a term used to describe electronic cigarettes. </p><p>Survey data has shown that vaporizing is becoming a more popular method of using pot, particularly in states that have legalized recreational use of the drug, Spindle said.</p><p>\"It heats it to a temperature that doesn't reach combustion,\" Spindle said of the vaporizing devices. \"If you look at the cannabis after it's done vaporizing, it doesn't turn into the black ash material it would when you smoke it. It looks exactly like it did when you put it in.\"</p><p>To see if vaporizers deliver a different high than smoking pot, Spindle and his colleagues recruited 17 healthy adults who were not frequent marijuana users and asked them to both smoke pot from a pipe and inhale the fumes produced by a vaporizer.</p><p>The same 25-milligram dose of pot produced a significantly stronger high when vaporized than when smoked, the findings showed. Pre-rolled joints sold at dispensaries typically contain 1 gram of pot.</p><p>People on vaporized pot also showed greater impairment than when they smoked the drug, based on testing that gauges the ability to think, reason and perform fine motor skills.</p><p>Vaporized pot came with more side effects as well, including heart racing (24 percent versus 18 percent for smoked), paranoia (17 percent versus 10 percent), hunger (38 percent versus 33 percent), dry mouth (67 percent versus 43 percent), and red eyes (25 percent versus 16 percent).</p><p>Blood tests revealed that people had much higher levels of THC in their circulation after using a vaporizer, about 14.4 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood compared with 10.2 ng/mL when they smoked pot.</p><p>The effects typically wore off between six to eight hours for both vaporized and smoked pot, the researchers said.</p><p>Heating but not burning pot appears to ensure that more of the weed's high-producing chemicals are imbibed by the user, Spindle said.</p><p>\"Our theory is that when you combust cannabis, more of the THC is lost due to the combustion process,\" Spindle said. \"The vaporizer is a more efficient delivery method than the smoked cannabis.\"</p><p>People who don't use marijuana regularly should approach vaporizers with caution, said Nadia Solowij, a professor at the University of Wollongong in Australia.</p><p>\"There is a perception that it is a safer route given that it avoids burning the plant matter, thus reducing toxins formed by that process,\" said Solowij, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study. \"These findings raise concerns for inexperienced users, which include those using [pot] both recreationally but also trying cannabis for medical reasons,\" she added.</p><p>\"It may be wise to use a smaller amount of cannabis in a vaporizer to achieve the desired effect,\" Solowij concluded.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/marijuana/health-effects.html\" target=\"_new\">health effects of marijuana</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Dec. 4, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- If your belly is full from a delicious holiday feast but there's one more sweet left on the dessert tray, will you hold back or yield to temptation?</p><p>New research suggests that you'll give in, driven by a widely shared attitude towards food that prompts you to \"clean the plate,\" even if you're not really still hungry.</p><p>It's a form of \"consumption closure,\" nutritionists say. But over time it makes keeping the waistline trim an uphill battle.</p><p>\"The concept of a clean plate has many roots,\" noted Connie Diekman, director of university nutrition at Washington University in St. Louis. \"The starving children of the world, the lack of food during WWI or II and, of course, the fact that many people do not notice feelings of satiety and eat until the food is gone.\"</p><p>And while \"what drives an individual to 'clean their plate' might be very individual, the concern is global,\" she added. \"Overeating is a component of our growing problem of overweight.\"</p><p>That thought was seconded by Lona Sandon, program director of the department of clinical nutrition in the school of health professions at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. \"These extra bites may lead to weight gain or hinder weight-loss attempts,\" she agreed.</p><p>\"Those of us in the nutrition and dietetics business are well aware of the 'clean plate' mentality,\" Sandon said. \"And this is something I would often talk about when working with people wanting to lose weight -- getting people to accept that they do not have to eat everything on their plate,  that it is OK to throw it in the trash, and that those few extra bites after you are already full have calories that can add up.\"</p><p>Still, new research suggests that it's really only when a little food is left on the plate that the \"clean-the-plate\" phenomenon kicks in; a plate still piled high with sweets appears to be far easier to resist.</p><p>In a series of four experiments, scientists led by Veronika Ilyuk of Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., repeatedly found that a single item left on the plate exerted a much stronger end-of-meal pull than multiple items, whether it be chocolate-covered almonds, cookies or pizza.</p><p>And the research team further found that people often choose to believe the unbelievable: that last cookie is actually good for them.</p><p>No matter that the two inches of sugary icing on top of a  1,000-calorie cupcake suggests otherwise; part of the \"clean-the-plate\" phenomenon is telling yourself the white lie that one more bite is not really the scale-buster that a silly calorie table might suggest.</p><p>As to what's driving the plate-cleaning urge to begin with, Sandon believes that the overriding impetus behind the \"cleaning-the-plate\" ethos is more about indulging than any broad biological survival imperative.</p><p>\"Such foods are highly palatable and can drive the desire to eat,\" she said, particularly when it comes to items that are high in fat, sugar or salt.</p><p>And that, said Sandon, means that a \"strategy to combat this may be to eat foods with less fat, added sugar and salt. You rarely hear people say I just need to eat that extra bite of broccoli but I am so stuffed. But they will do it with the chocolate cake.\"</p><p> Diekman suggested that \"slowing down your eating also helps. It takes time to feel satisfied and fast eaters miss that feeling.\" </p><p>Another strategy, according to Sandon, \"is to start with smaller serving sizes at meal and snack times. Simply put less on the plate to start. But again, this takes self-regulation. Using portion-controlled packages or containers may help with this as well.\"</p><p>But, she added, \"awareness and mindfulness may be the best strategy. Taking a moment to notice your thoughts and what you are telling yourself when you are tempted to take that last bite despite feeling full.\"</p><p>The report will be published in the February issue of the journal <i>Appetite</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on healthy holiday foods at the <a href=\"https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2016/11/healthy-holiday-foods-fun\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institutes of Health</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Feb. 26, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- For people with the deadly skin cancer melanoma, one dose of the drug Keytruda before surgery might stop the cancer in its tracks, according to a groundbreaking new study.</p><p>Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a PD-1 inhibitor, an immunotherapy drug that triggers the body's immune response to attack cancer cells. According to results of this study, the drug's effects peak as early as seven days after treatment -- much earlier than previously seen in other studies.</p><p>Moreover, patients who had a year of this immunotherapy treatment after surgery were free of their cancer for more than two years, the longest follow-up so far on patients with melanoma. </p><p>\"Anti-PD-1 works extremely rapidly, achieving immunological responses peaking in most patients within one to three weeks,\" said study co-author John Wherry. He's director of the Penn Institute for Immunology at the University of Pennsylvania. </p><p>About a third of the patients were \"essentially cured within three weeks, highlighting the rapidity of immunotherapy for cancer,\" Wherry said.</p><p>And in those patients whose cancer returned, researchers found revealing patterns in the way cancer adapts to the drug -- discoveries that could lead to better ways to treat such patients.</p><p>Keytruda is the drug responsible for the remission of former President Jimmy Carter's cancer in 2015. Carter, then 90, had melanoma that spread to his brain and liver. Treatment with Keytruda appears to have cured him.</p><p>The drug isn't cheap, costing about $150,000 a year. Keytruda is covered by most insurance, including Medicare, but copays can be high, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p><p>For the study, researchers gave 27 patients with advanced melanoma a single dose of Keytruda three weeks before surgery. </p><p>Eight patients had what researchers described as a complete response, meaning less than 10 percent of the cancer cells remained at the time of surgery. All eight remained cancer-free for up to 25 months of follow-up. </p><p>Researchers also investigated how tumor cells in patients whose cancer returned were able to develop a resistance to Keytruda. The investigators found two causes -- tumor mutations and increased activity of cells that naturally suppress the immune system. </p><p>Knowing the factors that cause a lack of response to the drug may help to identify patients who might benefit from other therapies in combination with PD-1, Wherry said. </p><p>Dr. Steven Savona, a physician at Northwell Health's Monter Cancer Center in Lake Success, N.Y., was not involved with the study, but reviewed the findings. He said the fast-acting immune response offers a new approach to a disease that used to be approachable only with surgery. </p><p>Savona said it could make the surgery simpler, and if used in combination with other treatments, surgery might not even be necessary for some patients. </p><p>\"This might be a new approach for patients with limited but advanced melanoma, but we do need additional testing to prove that,\" said Savona.</p><p>Merck, Inc., maker of Keytruda, supplied the drug for the study but did not fund the trial.</p><p>Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that more than 96,000 new melanomas will be diagnosed in the United States this year, and 7,200 people will die from the disease. </p><p>Standard treatment includes surgery followed by a year of drug treatment in high-risk patients. </p><p>The report was published Feb. 25 in the journal <i>Nature Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Cancer Society offers more facts about <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/melanoma-skin-cancer.html/\" target=\"_new\">melanoma</a>.</p>",

It affects millions of people worldwide and puts them at higher risk for stroke and, in rare cases, can lead to heart failure.</p><p>This study included 716 middle-aged men and women in Finland who were followed for an average of 19 years.

Kickstarting with the Whole30 diet may be a good choice, a  dietitian suggests.</p><p>But you have to be careful when you start a diet that restricts foods. These diets can be risky, according to Ohio State's Lori Chong, a certified diabetes educator.</p><p>The Whole30 program is only supposed to be used for 30 days. The diet requires you to cut out added sugar (real or artificial), alcohol, grains (including quinoa, corn and rice), legumes, dairy and carrageenan, MSG and sulfites, which are found in many processed foods.</p><p>\"Eating whole, unprocessed foods and making an effort to consume plenty of fruits and vegetables is a great goal for anyone,\" Chong said. So is cutting out sugar, she added.</p><p>Many people will lose weight on a diet like Whole30, but weight loss isn't the only goal. The diet can also help if you are at risk for diabetes, and help with conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome.</p><p>But after a 30-day wonder diet like Whole30, it's likely weight will return if you don't follow a few rules. Keeping the weight off is a matter of adding foods back into your diet with moderation and balance.</p><p>\"However, in my experience as a dietitian, most people have difficulty maintaining that balance when they go off a restrictive diet. The restrictive phase is often so restrictive that rebound overeating occurs,\" Chong explained in a university news release.</p><p>Moreover, these diets aren't for people with a history of eating disorders, pregnant women or frail folks.</p><p>These diets are great, however, for people who are willing to put in the time and effort to shop, cook and make healthy food choices.</p><p>Tips to keeping the weight off after your 30-day program include:</p><ul><li>Reintroduce foods one at a time and in small amounts. Don't go crazy with sugar. Reintroduce it slowly and keep amounts small.</li><li>Stick to whole grains -- don't use white flour products. </li> <li>Slowly reintroduce dairy, with foods like unsweetened or plain yogurt, and keep cheese to a minimum. </li><li>Stick to moderate drinking -- up to one drink a day for women, up to two drinks for men.</li><li>Add legumes (beans, lentils, peas, etc.) back to your usual diet. Legumes are nutrient-dense and high in fiber. Eat them every day.</li></ul><p>\"Every small step toward eating more vegetables and other whole foods  -- as well as fewer sugary and processed foods -- is a step in the right direction,\" Chong said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on healthy eating, visit the <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/eat-healthy/how-to-eat-healthy/index.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a>.</p>",

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration  approved Epidiolex for treatment of two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome.</p><p>Epidiolex, a twice-daily oral solution, is the first FDA-approved drug to contain an ingredient derived from the marijuana plant. CBD does not produce a high; that's caused by another compound in pot called THC.</p><p>To see how well CBD works in treating epilepsy, researchers recruited 92 children and adults whose seizures were not responding to other medications. All had used CBD for an average of nearly 20 months.</p><p>In this new study, CBD was used in a broader pool of patients, ranging from those with Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet to people with epilepsy caused by stroke.</p><p>About 57 percent saw their monthly seizure frequency cut in half while taking CBD, indicating that the treatment is effective.</p><p>But tolerance developed in about one-third of those patients after an average of seven months. Doctors needed to increase the dose by 30 percent to get the same benefit; otherwise, the seizures increased by more than 30 percent on the same dose, the findings showed.</p><p>Doctors increased the dose of CBD for all patients who developed tolerance, and 12 people responded well while 15 did not.</p><p>About one-third of patients stopped taking CBD due to lack of effectiveness or because of side effects, which included sleepiness and gastrointestinal issues, such as nausea, decreased appetite and vomiting, the researchers reported.</p><p>These results indicate that CBD is a valuable new epilepsy drug, but is not a magic bullet for treating seizures, epilepsy experts said.</p><p>\"We often talk about a honeymoon period when patients start a new medication. Many of those patients then relapse,\" said Dr. Fred Lado, Northwell Health's regional director of epilepsy for Queens and Long Island in New York. \"In this study, tolerance decreased after about seven months, which is similar to the honeymoon period we see with other medications.\"</p><p>Dr. Shlomo Shinnar, president of the American Epilepsy Society, agreed that epilepsy drugs tend to lose some effectiveness in patients over time.</p><p>\"This is not really a big shock: All the drugs we have and use, even when they work, a year later we're frequently moving on to the next drug,\" said Shinnar, director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Management Center at the Montefiore Medical Center and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. </p><p>\"This study should temper one's enthusiasm but it should not eliminate one's enthusiasm,\" he added. \"It's still a good drug. I intend to be using it in my patients.\"</p><p>There was hope that CBD might have been different from other epilepsy drugs, since the substance promotes increased activity in cannabinoid receptors in the brain, said Dr. Ruben Kuzniecky, director of research and clinical trials at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>Given that, it would have made sense that increases in tolerance would have been limited, he noted.</p><p>\"This is an important observation given the long-term data,\" Kuzniecky said. \"CBD is a welcome addition to the treatment of certain forms of epilepsy, but long-term use and larger populations will be needed to understand its limitations.\"</p><p>Research presented at meetings is typically considered preliminary until it is published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has more about <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm611046.htm\" target=\"_new\">Epidiolex</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Dec. 4, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The world's first baby born to a woman who had a uterus transplant from a deceased donor shows that such transplants can be successful, Brazilian doctors say. </p><p>The 6-pound baby girl was delivered by C-section to an unidentified young woman who had been born without a uterus.</p><p>The birth shows that pregnancies involving a uterus from a deceased donor are viable, said study leader Dr. Dani Ejzenberg.</p><p>\"The first uterus transplants from live donors were a medical milestone, creating the possibility of childbirth for many infertile women with access to suitable donors and the needed medical facilities,\" said Ejzenberg, who practices at the University of Sao Paolo. The Brazilian team reported the case Dec. 4 in <i>The Lancet</i>.</p><p>Ejzenberg stressed that it's rare that living women are willing and eligible to donate a uterus to a family member or close friend. That's why the new report is so important, he said.</p><p>\"The use of deceased donors could greatly broaden access to this treatment, and our results provide proof-of-concept for a new option for women with uterine infertility,\" Ejzenberg said in a journal news release.</p><p>There have been 10 other uterus transplants from deceased donors performed in the United States, the Czech Republic and Turkey, but this one in Brazil is the first to result in a live birth.</p><p>One U.S. fertility expert said the success in this case really could be a breakthrough.</p><p>\"Up to 15 percent of couples suffer from infertility and every year thousands of women are using gestational carriers in order to conceive,\" said Dr. Tomer Singer, who directs reproductive endocrinology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>\"Uterine transplantation can help many couples in achieving their dream of parenthood,\" he said, and \"using a uterus from a deceased organ donor increases the number of donors available significantly.\"</p><p>It also \"eliminates the main challenge,\" Singer added, \"which is finding a matching donor and risking the lives of live donors who have to otherwise undergo a major surgery to remove their uterus.\"</p><p>As Ejzenberg's team reported, the recipient in this case was a 32-year-old woman who was born without a uterus, and the donor was a 45-year-old woman who died of a stroke.</p><p>The 10.5-hour transplant surgery took place in September of 2016.</p><p>The recipient received five immunosuppression drugs (needed to prevent rejection of the new uterus by the body), antibiotics, anti-blood clotting treatment and aspirin while in hospital. Immunosuppression therapy continued after she left the hospital until the time of her baby's birth.</p><p>Before the transplant, the woman underwent in vitro fertilization, resulting in eight fertilized eggs that were frozen. Implantation of the eggs occurred seven months after the transplant, the researchers said.</p><p>Pregnancy was confirmed 10 days after implantation. The only complication during pregnancy was a kidney infection, which was treated with antibiotics. The baby girl was born at 35 weeks and three days.</p><p>The transplanted uterus was also removed during the cesarean section and showed no anomalies, the doctors noted.</p><p>The mother and baby were discharged from the hospital three days after birth. At the age of 7 months and 20 days, the baby continued to breastfeed and weighed 15 pounds, 14 ounces.</p><p>According to data included in the new report, among infertile couples, one in 500 have uterine infertility due to factors such as birth defects, hysterectomy or infection.</p><p>Singer noted that the first childbirth to a woman who received a uterus transplant from a live donor occurred in Sweden in 2013. There have so far been a total of 39 such procedures, resulting in 11 live births.</p><p>In these cases, the donor was \"usually a family member,\" he said.</p><p>Singer stressed that pregnancies involving transplanted uteruses from deceased donors have failed in the past, but the Brazilian case is \"an exciting step in the right direction.\"</p><p>Still, women who do carry a baby using this technique face challenges, he added.</p><p>These include the need to use several immune-suppressing drugs  throughout the 9 months of pregnancy, which may have side effects on both the mom and the baby; having to deliver the baby and then remove the uterus in a cesarean hysterectomy procedure; a high rate of organ rejection; and a lengthy surgery that requires a multi-disciplinary approach among doctors.</p><p>Furthermore, \"more research is needed for long-term outcome assessment for both the uterine recipient and the newborns,\" Singer concluded.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Office on Women's Health has more on <a href=\"https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/infertility\" target=\"_new\">female infertility</a>.</p>",

His team developed and implemented a new program to help keep those lifestyle changes on track.</p><p>The  findings were scheduled for presentation on Thursday at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.</p><p>In the study, Janni's team tracked outcomes for nearly 2,300 early stage breast cancer patients who'd been treated with chemotherapy. Half of these cancer survivors were randomly assigned to two years of ongoing telephone-based, personalized healthy living advice. The other half (the \"control\" group) received standard, general advice on a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>Those in the personalized lifestyle intervention group were coached in areas such as improving their diet, reducing fat intake, and increasing physical activity.</p><p>After two years, people in the intervention group saw an average weight loss of 2.2 pounds, while those in the control group experienced an average weight <i>gain</i> of 2.1 pounds, the findings showed.</p><p>But the real difference was in cancer outcomes, Janni's team said. The rate of disease-free survival among the nearly 1,500 patients who completed the lifestyle intervention was 35 percent higher than that of those who didn't complete the program. And it was 50 percent higher than women who didn't get the intervention at all.</p><p>The findings shouldn't come as a big surprise, Janni said.</p><p>Prior research \"has shown that obesity and low physical activity are associated with higher risks of developing breast cancer, as well as an increased risk of recurrence and reduced survival,\" he noted in a meeting news release.</p><p>One U.S. expert agreed.</p><p>Many women who've survived breast cancer may feel helpless, but \"it is great to be able to tell patients that, yes, there is something they can do to help prevent a recurrence,\" said Dr. Alice Police.

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 6, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Gavin Kuykendall's life has been shaped by his fight against heart disease. Now almost 12, he recently expressed all he's been through -- by writing a letter to his heart disease.</p> <p>\"You made my parents very sad,\" he said, reading his letter in a video. \"You tried to make my birthday an overwhelming and unhappy day. Even though you made me incredibly sick, I was brave, I was strong.\"</p> <p>Like all first-time parents-to-be, Faith and Adam Kuykendall were looking forward to their 20-week ultrasound and the chance to take another peek at their unborn child. </p> <p>\"Everything was going great until the doctor got to the heart,\" Faith said. \"You could just see his face drop and he said, 'Oh no.' \"</p> <p>Tests showed their son had a rare condition in which the left ventricle doesn't develop properly. It's called hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). The left ventricle is responsible for pumping freshly oxygenated blood out to the rest of the body.</p> <p>Without immediate intervention, HLHS is fatal, usually within days or weeks.</p> <p>Such specialized care wasn't available in their hometown of Tulsa. Their frequent medical appointments and the delivery would need to be in Oklahoma City, nearly two hours away.</p> <p>Gavin arrived after 28 hours of labor. Although Faith and Adam had been warned they could see a child \"blue and limp or not breathing,\" he came out screaming -- a great sign.</p> <p>Four days later, Gavin underwent open-heart surgery to create a way for the right ventricle to pump blood to both the lungs and the body. Doctors implanted a shunt that directs blood to the lungs.</p> <p>Doctors left the incision open for a few days until the swelling subsided.</p> <p>\"That was the worst,\" Faith said. \"He was naked and swollen. You could literally see his heart beating in his chest.\"</p> <p>Gavin remained in the hospital for a month. Four months later, it was time for a second procedure.</p> <p>Typically, this one is easier on the child. But Gavin \"wasn't eating, his left side wasn't functioning, and he was shaking,\" Faith said.</p> <p>Doctors discovered that not only had Gavin suffered a stroke during surgery, he'd become addicted to the powerful narcotics he'd been given. He was going through withdrawal, for which he was treated with methadone.</p> <p>Those first few years were tough for the Kuykendalls. Family, their church community and others in their support system helped them persevere, providing meals and ensuring that someone was always with Gavin. </p> <p>\"We even had a family CPR class so everyone would know what to do, just in case,\" Faith said.</p> <p>Their network came through again in 2009, when it was time for a third surgery.</p> <p>The surgeon who'd cared for Gavin had left Oklahoma for San Diego, leaving their home state without anyone capable of performing the operation. </p> <p>Friends and family helped raise the needed funds to travel to San Diego to stay with the same doctor. And all went well. At 2 1/2, Gavin's heart was rebuilt to the best of expectations. A few months later, Gavin became a big brother. Brody was born, thankfully with a well-formed heart. </p> <p>\"That kid is a walking comedian,\" Faith said. \"I think God knew we needed that.\"</p> <p>Gavin was 5 1/2 when he began facing more complications. Doctors determined he needed a pacemaker to help his heart beat in a regular rhythm. The family again returned to San Diego for the surgery.</p> <p>Around the same time, a close friend of the Kuykendalls -- Brandon Weeden -- was selected in the first round of the National Football League draft. Brandon's wife, Melanie, and Adam had worked together just out of college, and the couples had become close friends.  </p> <p>The Weedens were disappointed to learn that the state of Oklahoma lacked the specialists to operate on Gavin and other children. So after signing his NFL contract, Weeden started a foundation, which in turn helped establish a cardiac surgery research program at The Children's Hospital in Oklahoma City.</p> <p>\"I have so much respect for Gavin and the whole family,\" said Weeden, who now plays for the Houston Texans. \"He's already been through more in his lifetime than I'll ever go through. We have birthdays a day apart and try to celebrate together. I just think the world of him.\"</p> <p>Gavin is now in sixth grade and plays right field on his baseball team. Although he also loves football, he's not allowed to play contact sports. </p> <p>\"Of course he wants to do what all the other boys are doing, and that's a struggle,\" Faith said. \"Although he has some anxieties, and some physical and intellectual limitations, I don't want him to think that heart disease defines him. Luckily, he is the most determined, strong-willed child.\"</p> <p>Gavin said he's particularly proud of inspiring Weeden's foundation to help other children in Oklahoma. </p> <p>\"I want people to know that no matter what you have, or what you feel like, you're not alone,\" Gavin said. \"You can do this.\"</p>",

If you're more able to be physically active, you're more able to be sexually active,\" said Boothby, a research assistant in the department of community health sciences.</p><p>However, the researchers did not find any strong link between cardiac rehab and sexual satisfaction.</p><p>Cardiac rehabilitation is a medically supervised program designed to improve the heart health of people who've had a heart attack or heart failure, or have undergone angioplasty or heart surgery, according to the American Heart Association.</p><p>Rehab involves exercise counseling and training to improve fitness, education on heart-healthy living, and counseling to reduce stress.</p><p>For this review, Boothby and her colleagues pored through medical literature and found 14 studies that evaluated cardiac rehab's potential effect on a person's sex life.</p><p>Of six studies pertaining specifically to sexual function, three showed improvement after cardiac rehab and two showed mixed results, the researchers found. Only one showed worsened function following rehab.</p><p>Study results also showed that people tend to have sex more often after attending cardiac rehabilitation, compared with those who don't take part in the program.</p><p>Most of the research focused on men, Boothby said. But it could be expected that women would benefit similarly from cardiac rehabilitation.</p><p>\"There is just a lack of research being conducted on females right now for this whole topic,\" Boothby said.</p><p>There are three ways heart disease can impact sexuality, the researchers explained.</p><p>For one, physical limitations -- like fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, erectile dysfunction and vaginal dryness -- are common among people recovering from a heart problem.</p><p>In addition, blood pressure drugs have been associated with sexual dysfunction in men and decreased sexual response in women.</p><p>Finally, feelings of anxiety, fear and depression are common in heart disease patients, increasing apprehension around sex.</p><p>These problems can become a \"vicious circle that is hard to break,\" said Dr. Claudio Gil Soares de Araujo, director of research and education for the Exercise Medicine Clinic (CLINIMEX) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p><p>\"Regularly attending a cardiac rehabilitation program that will help to lose body fat, to gain muscles, to become more flexible, and to improve balance and the capacity to tolerate higher exercise intensity for longer periods of time is perhaps one of the best ways to help the sexual life of a man or woman with heart disease,\" said Araujo, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.</p><p>The positive benefits appear to stem largely from the exercise portion of cardiac rehab. There was no clear association between sexual activity and rehab programs that included psychological counseling, the findings showed.</p><p>Sex is on the minds of many people with heart problems, Boothby said, and their concerns aren't likely to be addressed while they're in the hospital or preparing to leave for home.</p><p>\"Sometimes discharge is very hectic. Patients are often getting a lot of information about their medications and physical activity, and then they're discharged,\" she said. \"That's not necessarily the best place to receive that information.\"</p><p>Previous research has shown that couples are very open to receiving sexual activity support within a cardiac rehabilitation program, Boothby added.</p><p>However, more study needs to be done on sex during recovery, she suggested, as there are still gaps in knowledge.</p><p>\"Sexual activity is very important to overall quality of life, and heart patients are living longer with cardiovascular disease than they ever were before,\" Boothby said. \"It's important to be addressing the non-clinical aspects of heart disease just as much as the clinical aspects.\"</p><p>The new evidence review was published Dec. 6 in the  <i>Canadian Journal of Cardiology</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart Association has more about <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cardiac-rehab/what-is-cardiac-rehabilitation\" target=\"_new\">cardiac rehabilitation</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 26, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- A new government study finds that roughly 1 in 40 American children has autism, a huge jump from the previous estimate of 1 in every 59 children.</p><p>The survey asked parents of more than 43,000 children between the ages of 3 and 17 whether or not their children had ever been diagnosed with autism or an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), <i>and</i> whether the child in question still struggled with an ASD.</p><p>Study author Michael Kogan offered several explanations for the discrepancy between the previous figure from the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the new figures from the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health.</p><p>First, he noted that \"because there is no biological test for ASD, it is difficult to track.\" And he added that different data collection methods can produce very different results.</p><p>For example, Kogan pointed out that the CDC only collected information on 8-year-olds living in 11 residential areas. By comparison, the latest survey looked at a far wider age range, and is the first such effort to be national in scope.</p><p>The latest figure is also based on a more recent time frame than the CDC's last review in 2014, he noted. And his team's conclusions stem from information collected from parents, while the CDC conducted a review of medical and school records.</p><p>\"I don't know if 'surprised' is the word I would use,\" Kogan said about his team's findings. \"We began the study knowing that the prevalence of ASD had been increasing for the last 30 to 40 years.\"</p><p>Kogan serves as director of the Office of Epidemiology and Research in the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration.</p><p>Apart from arriving at an estimate for autism prevalence, the investigators noted that more than a quarter of children with ASD (27 percent) were taking some type of medication to tackle the disorder's symptoms. Nearly two-thirds (64 percent) had been receiving behavioral treatment in the year leading up to the survey.</p><p>But parents of children with autism indicated that their children had greater care needs -- and had more trouble getting that care -- relative to those struggling with other comparable conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression and anxiety, Down syndrome, behavioral or conduct problems, intellectual or learning disabilities, and/or Tourette syndrome.</p> <p>Specifically, parents said they were 44 percent more likely to have trouble getting mental health care, 24 percent less likely to get care coordination help, and 23 percent less likely to have a \"medical home\" for their child, meaning a single team of caregivers.</p><p>The findings were published online Nov. 26 in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i>.</p><p>Thomas Frazier, chief science officer at Autism Speaks, expressed little surprise at the findings.</p><p>\"They are generally consistent with previous parent surveys and other direct prevalence studies where researchers directly screen for and attempt to identify autism,\" he said, adding that the CDC numbers are \"probably a bit conservative.\"</p><p>As to why estimates have generally been rising in recent years, Frazier dismissed the idea that the overall share of American children who have autism is growing that rapidly, suggesting instead that analysis methods have become \"more liberal and inclusive.\"</p><p>As to the broader question of access to care, Frazier agreed that there is an urgent need to provide better access to early screening and subsequent treatment, particularly for low-income families.</p><p>\"At Autism Speaks, we have attempted through our Autism Treatment Network to increase pediatricians' and family practice doctors' awareness and ability to screen,\" in addition to providing \"gold-standard\" medical care, he said.</p><p>And Frazier added that \"early, intensive developmental and behavioral interventions are effective,\" especially when parents get the training they need to be better positioned to help their child.</p><p>According to Autism Speaks, autism spectrum disorder refers to a \"broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on accessing autism care at <a href=\"https://www.autismspeaks.org/autism-treatment-network-atn\" target=\"_new\">Autism Speaks</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 27, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- There isn't much news about this flu season yet, and the headlines about last year's terrible toll have faded.</p> <p>But don't stop paying attention to the annual health menace, and what nearly everyone needs to do about it: Get a flu shot.</p> <p>\"It's still early in the season,\" said Dr. Trish Perl, chief of infectious diseases at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. \"But there have been some flu deaths reported already, which is always concerning to us.\"</p> <p>Last year caused great concern.</p> <p>At a news conference in late September kicking off the vaccination drive, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said that a particularly fierce strain of the flu virus and vaccination rates that declined in some age groups \"combined to make it a particularly bad flu season.\"</p> <p>In a recent weekly report, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said flu activity around the country remained low. But that is not unusual. Peak flu season can range from December to March, with February the most common peak month.</p> <p>However, health experts recommend that anyone over the age of 6 months get a flu shot by November at the latest because the vaccine takes two weeks to become effective. Perl said that discrepancy -- urging people to get shots before the flu has become a problem -- might dilute the message's effectiveness.</p> <p>\"Flu is something people have been a little blas&eacute; about,\" she said. \"They don't understand it's a disease that kills a lot of people. This isn't just something that puts you in bed for a couple of days. It increases your risks of heart attack, of hospitalization and of death.\"</p> <p>The flu is estimated to cause between 12,000 and 56,000 deaths and up to 710,000 hospitalizations in the U.S. each year.</p> <p>Flu has always taken its biggest toll among older people and those with underlying illnesses. A study published earlier this year in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> confirmed longstanding suspicions that the flu is linked to heart attacks.</p> <p>The Canadian study analyzing five years of data showed that people over 35 who caught the flu had a six times greater chance of suffering a heart attack in the week following their diagnosis.</p> <p>\"Infections put a big toll on your heart,\" said Dr. Jennifer Robinson, a cardiologist and professor of epidemiology at the University of Iowa's Carver College of Medicine. \"It has to pump more and people with heart failure can't keep up. Infection can cause you to have an inflammation and a plaque rupture, which can cause a heart attack or stroke.\"</p> <p>As usual, the recommendations to get a flu shot come with asterisks: There's no way to know how bad a flu season will be, and the vaccine prepared months in advance doesn't always target every strain of flu virus that actually hits. You still might get the flu, although it will likely be less severe. And yes, your shoulder may get a little sore, but the vaccine does not cause the flu.</p> <p>None of that is a good excuse to go unvaccinated, Robinson said. \"The older you get, the harder it is to fight off infections,\" she said. \"And for anyone who has chronic diseases, the flu can tip people over and cause complications. So why take a chance?\"</p> <p>The surgeon general was more blunt.</p> <p>\"I'm tired of hearing people say, 'Well, I didn't get sick and I didn't get the flu shot.' Or, 'I don't like it, my arm hurts,' \" Adams said. \"Getting the flu shot isn't just about keeping you safe. Getting the flu shot is about community, about everyone else around you.\"</p> <p>Because the virus is so contagious, people who are vaccinated help protect those who aren't, he said.</p> <p>No matter how bad the upcoming flu season turns out, Robinson said to think of the vaccine as the perfect holiday gift for your family.</p> <p>\"The weather dries out, we all get together for the holidays and we spread our germs,\" she said. \"So, get protection.\"</p>",

Your heart may love it, too.</p><p>New research from sauna-loving Finland suggests that for people aged 50 and older, saunas may lower their odds of risk of dying from heart disease.</p><p>Specifically, just 5 percent of Finns in the study who spent more than 45 minutes in a sauna each week died of heart disease over the 15-year study period, compared to 10 percent of those who spent less that 15 minutes a week in saunas, the researchers said.</p><p>Of course, the study couldn't prove cause-and-effect --  it's possible that sauna-loving folk have other heart-healthy habits that might explain the findings.</p><p>Still, \"there are several possible reasons why sauna use may decrease the risk of death due to cardiovascular disease,\" said study co-author Dr. Jari Laukkanen, head of cardiology at the University of Eastern Finland. His team published its findings Nov. 28 in the journal <i>BMC Medicine</i>.</p><p>\"Our research team has shown in previous studies that high sauna use is associated with lower blood pressure,\" he noted in a journal news release. \"Additionally, sauna use is known to trigger an increase in heart rate equal to that seen in low- to moderate-intensity physical exercise.\"</p><p>One U.S. expert who looked over the findings agreed that heat can often be therapeutic to the human body, but the sauna experience might differ a bit in America.</p><p>\"The greatest benefit [in the study] was observed in individuals who took 4-7 saunas per week, a frequency that Americans are unlikely to achieve,\" noted Dr. Cindy Grines, who directs cardiology at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y.</p><p>\"In addition, this study used dry heat, and whether the results are similar with steam baths or hot tubs is not known,\" she said.</p><p>Laukkanen's team agreed that because the data came from one area in Finland, the findings might not apply to other populations.</p><p>The study relied on data from nearly 1,700 Finnish men and women. Participants were asked about their use of saunas, and these data were compared with deaths from cardiovascular disease. Data for the study were collected between 1998 and 2015 and the average follow-up was 15 years.</p><p>Frequency of sauna use did seem tied to heart health. Among people who used a sauna four to seven times a week, 3 percent died from heart disease over 15 years, but that number rose to 10 percent for those who used the sauna just once a week, the study found.</p><p>Dr. David Friedman is chief of heart failure services at Long Island Jewish Valley Stream Hospital in Valley Stream, N.Y. He said that it's tough to draw firm conclusions from the study, but the findings suggest that sauna use \"could be a helpful additional strategy\" for heart health, along with improved diet and more exercise.</p><p>But another cardiologist stressed that Americans shouldn't begin think of saunas as substitutes for exercise.</p><p>\"Moderate to high intensity exercise has a cardioprotective effect,\" explained Dr. Satjit Bhusri, who practices at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. The new findings don't necessarily mean that \"everyone should spend the day at the spa [instead],\" he said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more information on cardiovascular disease , visit the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/consumer-healthcare/what-is-cardiovascular-disease\" target=\"_new\"> American Heart Association</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Dec. 11, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Women often delay calling for emergency help when heart attack symptoms start, a new study finds.</p><p>Researchers in Switzerland found that women suffering a heart attack typically waited 37 minutes longer than men before calling an ambulance. And those delays showed no signs of improving over the 16-year study period.</p><p>One reason may be the persistent myth that heart attacks are a \"man's disease,\" said lead researcher Dr. Matthias Meyer, a cardiologist at Triemli Hospital, in Zurich.</p><p>In addition, he said, women are more likely than men to suffer lesser-known heart symptoms, like pain in the back, shoulder or stomach. That means many women -- and the people who witness their symptoms -- may not immediately realize they should call for help, Meyer said.</p><p>Yet, the study found, even when women had the \"classic\" heart attack symptom of chest pain, they often hesitated to call for help.</p><p>And while the findings come from Switzerland, a similar pattern has been seen in other countries, too, according to Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a spokesperson for the American Heart Association (AHA).</p><p>Steinbaum pointed to a recent research review finding that, overall, women waited 30 percent longer than men to call for help.</p><p>\"That tells us this is a worldwide problem,\" said Steinbaum, who directs the women's cardiovascular prevention, health and wellness program at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.</p><p>She agreed with Meyer on the potential reasons, and also noted that many women are simply used to putting their families first, and their own health second. So even when they have symptoms like chest pain, she said,  women may often take a \"Let's see what happens\" attitude.</p><p>For the study, Meyer's team analyzed records from nearly 4,400 heart attack patients treated at their hospital between 2000 and 2016.</p><p>The good news: Over the years, ambulance crews and hospital staff got patients into treatment faster, and the improvement was equal for women and men.</p><p>The bad news: By 2016, women were still spending 41 minutes longer in \"ischemia\" -- a reduction in the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart. And that was largely due to delays in calling emergency services, the researchers found.</p><p>Heart attacks occur when a clot obstructs blood flow to the heart. The quicker doctors can restore that blood flow, the less damage there will be to the heart muscle.</p><p>\"There's a saying, 'Time is muscle,' \" Steinbaum said.</p><p>Over the years, the AHA and its counterparts in other countries have launched public campaigns to raise women's awareness of heart disease. Yet the new study found that women were waiting just as long to call for help in 2016 as they were in 2000.</p><p>In contrast, men were slightly quicker to seek help by the end of the study -- about 6 minutes, typically.</p><p> Meyer said it's not surprising that the delays among women failed to change, but it is disappointing.</p><p> Steinbaum added, \"We've clearly got more work to do. We've got to keep this conversation going.\"</p><p>According to the AHA, cardiovascular disease is the top killer of U.S. women, causing about one out of every three deaths.</p><p>As with men, chest pain is the most common heart attack symptom among women, the AHA says. But other symptoms include shortness of breath; pain in the back, jaw or stomach; and nausea or lightheadedness. And women are more likely than men to have those subtler problems.</p><p>\"If you have those symptoms, act on them,\" Steinbaum said. \"Call 911.\"</p><p>If it turns out you really have bad heartburn, she added, that's good -- you'll get to go home.</p><p>Sometimes, Steinbaum noted, people worry about \"bothering\" ER doctors and nurses with non-serious problems.</p><p>\"You're not bothering us,\" she said. \"That's our job.\"</p><p>The study was published online Dec. 11 in the <i>European Heart Journal: Acute Cardiovascular Care</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The AHA's Go Red For Women campaign has more on <a href=\"https://www.goredforwomen.org/\" target=\"_new\">women and heart disease</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 6, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Gavin Kuykendall's life has been shaped by his fight against heart disease. Now almost 12, he recently expressed all he's been through -- by writing a letter to his heart disease.</p> <p>\"You made my parents very sad,\" he said, reading his letter in a video. \"You tried to make my birthday an overwhelming and unhappy day. Even though you made me incredibly sick, I was brave, I was strong.\"</p> <p>Like all first-time parents-to-be, Faith and Adam Kuykendall were looking forward to their 20-week ultrasound and the chance to take another peek at their unborn child. </p> <p>\"Everything was going great until the doctor got to the heart,\" Faith said. \"You could just see his face drop and he said, 'Oh no.' \"</p> <p>Tests showed their son had a rare condition in which the left ventricle doesn't develop properly. It's called hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). The left ventricle is responsible for pumping freshly oxygenated blood out to the rest of the body.</p> <p>Without immediate intervention, HLHS is fatal, usually within days or weeks.</p> <p>Such specialized care wasn't available in their hometown of Tulsa. Their frequent medical appointments and the delivery would need to be in Oklahoma City, nearly two hours away.</p> <p>Gavin arrived after 28 hours of labor. Although Faith and Adam had been warned they could see a child \"blue and limp or not breathing,\" he came out screaming -- a great sign.</p> <p>Four days later, Gavin underwent open-heart surgery to create a way for the right ventricle to pump blood to both the lungs and the body. Doctors implanted a shunt that directs blood to the lungs.</p> <p>Doctors left the incision open for a few days until the swelling subsided.</p> <p>\"That was the worst,\" Faith said. \"He was naked and swollen. You could literally see his heart beating in his chest.\"</p> <p>Gavin remained in the hospital for a month. Four months later, it was time for a second procedure.</p> <p>Typically, this one is easier on the child. But Gavin \"wasn't eating, his left side wasn't functioning, and he was shaking,\" Faith said.</p> <p>Doctors discovered that not only had Gavin suffered a stroke during surgery, he'd become addicted to the powerful narcotics he'd been given. He was going through withdrawal, for which he was treated with methadone.</p> <p>Those first few years were tough for the Kuykendalls. Family, their church community and others in their support system helped them persevere, providing meals and ensuring that someone was always with Gavin. </p> <p>\"We even had a family CPR class so everyone would know what to do, just in case,\" Faith said.</p> <p>Their network came through again in 2009, when it was time for a third surgery.</p> <p>The surgeon who'd cared for Gavin had left Oklahoma for San Diego, leaving their home state without anyone capable of performing the operation. </p> <p>Friends and family helped raise the needed funds to travel to San Diego to stay with the same doctor. And all went well. At 2 1/2, Gavin's heart was rebuilt to the best of expectations. A few months later, Gavin became a big brother. Brody was born, thankfully with a well-formed heart. </p> <p>\"That kid is a walking comedian,\" Faith said. \"I think God knew we needed that.\"</p> <p>Gavin was 5 1/2 when he began facing more complications. Doctors determined he needed a pacemaker to help his heart beat in a regular rhythm. The family again returned to San Diego for the surgery.</p> <p>Around the same time, a close friend of the Kuykendalls -- Brandon Weeden -- was selected in the first round of the National Football League draft. Brandon's wife, Melanie, and Adam had worked together just out of college, and the couples had become close friends. </p> <p>The Weedens were disappointed to learn that the state of Oklahoma lacked the specialists to operate on Gavin and other children. So after signing his NFL contract, Weeden started a foundation, which in turn helped establish a cardiac surgery research program at The Children's Hospital in Oklahoma City.</p> <p>\"I have so much respect for Gavin and the whole family,\" said Weeden, who now plays for the Houston Texans. \"He's already been through more in his lifetime than I'll ever go through. We have birthdays a day apart and try to celebrate together. I just think the world of him.\"</p> <p>Gavin is now in sixth grade and plays right field on his baseball team. Although he also loves football, he's not allowed to play contact sports. </p> <p>\"Of course he wants to do what all the other boys are doing, and that's a struggle,\" Faith said. \"Although he has some anxieties, and some physical and intellectual limitations, I don't want him to think that heart disease defines him. Luckily, he is the most determined, strong-willed child.\"</p> <p>Gavin said he's particularly proud of inspiring Weeden's foundation to help other children in Oklahoma. </p> <p>\"I want people to know that no matter what you have, or what you feel like, you're not alone,\" Gavin said. \"You can do this.\"</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Sept. 19, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- If a pregnant woman eats a lot of high-gluten foods, the odds that her child will have type 1 diabetes rise significantly, new research suggests.</p><p>In the study, pregnant women who had the highest consumption of gluten had double the risk of having a child with type 1 diabetes compared to those who ate the least gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye and barley. </p><p>However, the study authors noted that it's too soon to recommend that pregnant women change their diets based on the results of this one study.</p><p>\"The study brings new ideas to how type 1 diabetes develops. We did not know that the pregnancy period is important for the development of the disease [or] that the development of the disease is starting that early in life,\" said study co-author Dr. Knud Josefsen.</p><p> \"And it also holds the potential to reduce the frequency of the disease by simply changing the diet during pregnancy,\" added Josefsen, a senior researcher at the Bartholin Institute in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p><p>However, \"the study is observational and the link that we describe is an association,\" and not a cause-and-effect relationship, Josefsen said. The research also needs to be repeated in other populations. </p><p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that causes the body's immune system to mistakenly attack the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, according to JDRF (formerly Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation). Insulin is a hormone that helps usher the sugar from foods into the body's cells to be used as fuel. </p><p>The attack on the immune system cells leaves someone with type 1 diabetes with little to no insulin. Without insulin injections -- via multiple shots a day or an insulin pump -- someone with type 1 diabetes doesn't have enough insulin to survive. </p><p>Gluten is found in many foods -- including bread, pasta, cereal, crackers and cookies -- according to the Celiac Disease Foundation. Gluten triggers the immune system disorder called celiac disease that causes damage to the small intestine when gluten is consumed.</p><p>There's already a known link between celiac disease and type 1 diabetes -- approximately 10 percent of people with type 1 diabetes also have celiac disease, Josefsen said.</p><p>The latest study included data from almost 64,000 pregnant women enrolled from 1996 through 2002. Nearly 250 of these women's children developed type 1 diabetes. </p><p>The women answered questions about the foods they ate when they were 25 weeks' pregnant. </p><p>The average gluten intake was 13 grams per day. The range was less than 7 grams per day to more than 20 grams per day. Josefsen said a slice of bread has about 3 grams of gluten. A large serving of pasta -- about two-thirds of a cup -- has 5 to 10 grams of gluten, he said.</p><p>The researchers found that a child's risk of type 1 diabetes increased proportionally with every 10 grams of the mother's daily gluten intake. </p><p>Josefsen said there are some theories as to how gluten might contribute to the rise of type 1 diabetes. One is that gluten may cause inflammation and an immune response. </p><p>Maija Miettinen, co-author of an editorial that accompanied the study, said most of the theories as to how these two conditions might be related come from animal models. Like Josefsen, she said more research is needed.</p><p>\"This is the first study to suggest an association between high gluten intake during pregnancy and the risk of type 1 diabetes in the offspring. Therefore, it is too early to change dietary recommendations concerning gluten intake,\" she said. Miettinen is a researcher with the National Institute for Health and Welfare in Helsinki, Finland.</p><p>Miettinen also pointed out that women who have high-gluten diets in pregnancy may also continue to serve their children high-gluten fare. \"We do not know whether the possible risk associated with high gluten intake comes through prenatal exposure, childhood diet or both,\" she said. </p><p>The study was published online Sept. 19 in the <i>BMJ</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p> Harvard T.H.

She is a research fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.</p><p>\"We are not the first group talking about noise and cardiovascular disease,\" Radfar said. \"What we really show here is the mechanism linking noise to major adverse cardiovascular events.\"</p><p>For the study, Radfar and her colleagues analyzed imaging scans of 499 healthy people, looking specifically at their brains and blood vessels.</p><p>The investigators then used the participants' home addresses to obtain noise level estimates of their neighborhoods, based on aviation and highway noise data kept by the U.S. Department of Transportation.</p><p>People in the noisiest neighborhoods had higher levels of activity in their amygdala and more inflammation in their arteries, the researchers found.</p><p>The research team then followed the study participants for an average 3.7 years, to see if these symptoms of stress would lead to heart problems.</p><p>The findings showed that people exposed to chronic noise had a greater than threefold risk of suffering a heart attack, stroke or other major cardiovascular event, compared with people who had lower levels of noise exposure.</p><p>That risk remained elevated even after the researchers accounted for other risk factors, such as air pollution, high cholesterol, smoking and diabetes.</p><p>But the study could not prove that noise caused heart risks to rise.</p><p>Still, the amygdala appears to increase heart risk by triggering the release of hormones that fuel blood vessel inflammation, the researchers concluded.</p><p> Dr. Nieca Goldberg is director of the NYU Langone Tisch Center for Women's Health in New York City. She said, based on this research, noise is \"a link in the chain of cardiovascular risk, and I think it is an interesting question for doctors to ask their patients when assessing their cardiac risk.\" </p><p>Radfar even suggested that people affected by transportation noise might consider soundproofing their homes.</p><p>On a community level, highway and urban planners can protect the populace by making road-noise barriers a part of road construction, Radfar suggested.</p><p>And, Goldberg added, if you're in a noisy neighborhood, you might also want to consider other ways to reduce your stress. These might include yoga, meditation or aerobic exercise.</p><p>The findings are to be presented Nov. 11 at the American Heart Association's annual meeting, in Chicago.

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Oct. 5, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- After years of public health warnings about antibiotic misuse, a new study suggests the problem is far from being solved.</p><p>Researchers found that of more than 500,000 antibiotic prescriptions they analyzed, nearly half were written without an infection-related diagnosis. And about 20 percent were given without an office visit -- usually over the phone.</p><p>It's not clear how many of those prescriptions were actually inappropriate, said lead researcher Dr. Jeffrey Linder, of Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.</p><p>His team looked at patient records, and \"bad coding\" could be part of the problem, Linder explained. He was referring to the system doctors use for recording diagnoses.</p><p>Still, the findings are concerning, Linder said.</p><p>They suggest that some doctors are still doling out antibiotics too readily -- probably, in part, because they assume patients want them, according to Linder.</p><p>But such indiscriminate antibiotic use is a driving force behind the widespread problem of antibiotic-resistant infections. Antibiotics are effective only against bacterial infections -- not the common cold or other ills caused by viruses. When people use antibiotics unnecessarily, that exposes bacteria to the drugs and gives them a chance to mutate and become resistant.</p><p>So for years, public health experts have been warning doctors and patients against indiscriminate antibiotic use.</p><p>For the current study, Linder's team looked at nearly 510,000 antibiotic prescriptions doled out at 514 medical clinics over two years. The prescribers included doctors, nurse practitioners and physician assistants in primary care and specialties such as gastroenterology and dermatology.</p><p>Overall, 46 percent of prescriptions were given with no documented diagnosis of an infection. In 29 percent of cases, another diagnosis -- such as high blood pressure -- was recorded; 17 percent of prescriptions had no diagnosis given.</p><p>In addition, 1 in 5 prescriptions was made with no in-person visit.</p><p>There are times when prescribing by phone is fine, Linder noted. If a woman with a history of urinary tract infections develops those symptoms, he said, it may be \"perfectly appropriate\" to prescribe an antibiotic without a visit.</p><p>Another example would be a prescription refill for someone taking antibiotics for acne, Linder said. But for the most part, he added, patients should be seen in the office before getting an antibiotic.</p><p>Linder was to present the findings Friday at IDWeek 2018, an annual meeting of infectious disease specialists, in San Francisco. In general, studies presented at meetings are considered preliminary until they are published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>Dr. Ebbing Lautenbach, chief of the infectious diseases division at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed the study can't show whether all of the prescriptions were actually inappropriate. \"But this certainly raises concerns that antibiotics are often prescribed for reasons that are unclear,\" he added.</p> <p>Lautenbach said patients should feel free to ask questions when an antibiotic is prescribed. \"Sometimes an antibiotic is an appropriate choice, and sometimes it's not. Providers should explain, 'Here's why I think an antibiotic is necessary.' And there should be a discussion of the pros and cons of taking one,\" he suggested.</p><p>Besides the public health issue of antibiotic resistance, the drugs can also have side effects for any one person, like nausea and diarrhea, and interactions with other medications, Lautenbach noted.</p> <p>Linder said his team plans to take a \"deeper dive\" into their data, to learn more about the conditions doctors were treating with antibiotics.</p><p>For now, Linder said there could be multiple reasons that doctors would prescribe an antibiotic even if there is no definite diagnosis of a bacterial infection. Time demands, for example, may push some doctors to throw an antibiotic at a sore throat.</p><p>In some cases, Linder said, a patient might insist on an antibiotic, and the doctor gives in.</p><p>\"But I think that more often, the problem is the doctor's perception that patients want antibiotics,\" he said.</p><p>Linder suggested that patients take a more proactive role when it comes to the medications.</p><p>\"You can tell your doctor that you only want an antibiotic if it's really necessary,\" he said. \"That will automatically shift the doctor's default position on it.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>To learn more about proper antibiotic use, visit the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/community/about/should-know.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 5, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Some bystanders may avoid performing CPR on women because they fear hurting them, or even being accused of sexual assault, preliminary research suggests.</p><p>In two new studies, researchers tried to dig deeper into a puzzling pattern that has been seen in past research: Women are less likely than men to receive bystander CPR if they go into cardiac arrest in a public place.</p><p>One study confirmed that real-world phenomenon in a controlled setting: It found that even in \"virtual reality\" simulations, participants were less likely to perform CPR when the virtual victim was female, versus male.</p><p>People performed CPR on 65 percent of male victims, but only 54 percent of females.</p><p>A separate study, which surveyed 54 adults, turned up some possible explanations.</p><p>Respondents said bystanders may worry about hurting a woman while doing CPR chest compressions -- or fear being accused of sexual assault. Some said people also might believe women's breasts get in the way of CPR.</p><p>The respondents also cited a long-standing misconception: Women are less likely to have heart problems than men.</p><p>But the reality is that heart disease is the leading killer of U.S. women and men alike, according to government figures.</p><p>And when cardiac arrest strikes, CPR can be lifesaving, regardless of sex, said Dr. Sarah Perman, who led the survey.</p><p>People in cardiac arrest need immediate chest compressions, said Perman, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver.</p><p>\"Providing this lifesaving procedure for women should be normalized, and not sexualized,\" she said.</p><p>In the United States, more than 356,000 people suffer cardiac arrest outside a hospital each year. Only about 11 percent survive, according to the American Heart Association (AHA).</p><p>Survival is dismal because without emergency treatment, cardiac arrest is fatal within minutes. But quick CPR can double or triple survival odds, the AHA says.</p><p>Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating and cannot pump blood and oxygen to the body. If a bystander performs CPR, that keeps the victim's blood circulating, buying time until paramedics arrive. Cardiac arrest is not a heart attack, which is caused by an artery blockage that diminishes blood flow to the heart.</p><p>\"There is still a lot of misunderstanding about cardiac arrest and CPR,\" said Dr. Aaron Donoghue of the AHA and the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Men and women benefit equally from CPR chest compressions, Donoghue said, adding that the notion that it could injure women is \"false.\"</p><p>As for fears of being accused of sexual assault, Donoghue noted that chest compressions are performed on the breastbone (also called the sternum, it's the long flat bone in the center of the chest) -- not the breasts.</p><p>\"It would be terrible for that fear to deter a would-be rescuer from performing CPR,\" said Donoghue, who was not involved in the new studies.</p><p>\"Doing nothing is always worse than doing something,\" he added.</p><p>For its pilot study, Perman's team surveyed 54 U.S. adults. Participants were asked: \"Do you have any ideas on why women may be less likely to receive CPR than men when they collapse in public?\"</p><p>Their answers reflect their personal perceptions, Donoghue pointed out. So, he said, it's hard to know whether witnesses to cardiac arrest really do act on such beliefs in the real world.</p><p>Perman agreed, saying more research is needed to understand why women are less likely to receive CPR. She and her colleagues have already conducted a larger survey, she said, but the results have not been published yet.</p><p>For now, Donoghue suggested people educate themselves about cardiac arrest and CPR. The AHA website is one place to start, he said.</p><p>Both studies are scheduled for presentation Nov. 10 at an AHA meeting, in Chicago. Research presented at meetings is typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart Association has guidance on <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/cpr\" target=\"_new\">performing CPR</a>.</p>",

He's a cardiovascular research fellow with Imperial College London.</p><p>\"Improvement in function represents remission rather than permanent improvement for many patients,\" Halliday explained.</p><p>The hearts of people with dilated cardiomyopathy can't pump strong enough because the left ventricle of their heart has become stretched out and thin-walled.</p><p>Several different types of medications -- diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) -- can help the heart beat improve.</p><p>But these drugs can place a financial strain on patients and come with a host of side effects, Halliday said. Patients with recovered heart function often ask whether they can drop their meds.</p><p>To see whether this could be possible, Halliday and his colleagues recruited 51 heart failure patients to have their heart meds gradually withdrawn.</p><p>The patients received regular clinical reviews, followed by an evaluation at six months.</p><p>Around four out of 10 patients relapsed during the drug-withdrawal period, and had to be placed back on medication immediately.</p><p>\"They did seem to recover when we put them back on medications very quickly,\" Halliday said.</p><p>About half of patients completed the follow-up period without needing to go back on meds, the researchers reported.</p><p>The findings were presented Sunday at the American Heart Association annual meeting, in Chicago. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>These results show that \"we should tread lightly\" when patients ask to be taken off their heart medications, said Dr. Jane Wilcox, an assistant professor of cardiology with Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, in Chicago.</p><p>For the patients who relapsed, their heart failure came back \"within just eight weeks of withdrawal of medication. Eight weeks. Two months,\" Wilcox said.</p><p>\"The question of recovery versus remission has potentially been answered by this pilot study. Currently, in 2018, we have no true signature of recovery,\" Wilcox said. \"These patients indeed are in cardiac remission.\"</p><p>Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones is chair of preventive medicine at Northwestern. The study helps inform \"an incredibly important clinical question that comes up all the time,\" he said.</p><p>\"It does push us down the path of trying to understand better which patients in the future we might want to select for withdrawal of drug therapy, because no patient wants to be on more medications than they need to be,\" Lloyd-Jones said. \"For the time being, this class of patients is going to have to maintain their medications until we understand more.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on dilated cardiomyopathy, visit the <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cardiomyopathy/what-is-cardiomyopathy-in-adults/dilated-cardiomyopathy-dcm\" target=\"_new\">American Heart Association</a>.</p>",

The concept holds that mentally engaging activities -- from reading to crosswords to board games -- may help the brain resist dementia later in life.</p><p>In this study, older adults who said they enjoyed those pastimes were no less likely to show signs of mental decline over time, versus other older folks.</p><p>But they did, on average, score higher on standard tests of mental sharpness. That means that while they did decline over time, they did so from a higher \"starting point,\" the researchers explained.</p><p>\"The results indicate that a lifetime of engagement lifts you to a high point from which you decline, and that can be considered as passive cognitive reserve,\" said lead researcher Roger Staff, of the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.</p><p>\"Starting from a high point,\" he said, \"will mean that the threshold at which you are considered impaired will be farther into the future.\"</p><p>\"Cognitive reserve\" can be seen as the brain's ability to find alternative ways to get things done. In theory, a person with greater cognitive reserve may be able to withstand pathological changes in the brain for a longer time before showing signs of dementia.</p><p>\"The idea is that yes, you'll decline -- but the higher the level you start from, the more years you'll have with good functioning,\" said Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association.</p><p>Fargo, who was not involved in the study, saw the results in a positive light -- agreeing that they support the cognitive reserve hypothesis.</p><p>However, he said, they do not actually prove that study participants' penchant for puzzles directly boosted their brain power.</p><p>That takes \"intervention trials,\" Fargo said -- where people would be randomly assigned to engage in certain mentally stimulating activities or not.</p><p>The Alzheimer's Association is launching a trial, dubbed POINTER, that will test the effects of mental stimulation along with other lifestyle changes -- including exercise, social engagement and better control of health conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes.</p><p>It will look at whether those measures can protect mental function in older adults at increased risk of decline.</p><p>The latest study included nearly 500 older British adults who had all taken the same intelligence test when they were about 11 -- back in the 1940s. Starting at the age of 64, they answered questions about whether they engaged in intellectually stimulating activities, such as solving puzzles, playing board games, reading or going to museums.</p><p>They also took standard tests of memory and thinking over the next 15 years -- up to five times.</p><p>Overall, the study found, people who liked to challenge their minds were no less likely to show mental decline over time. But they did perform better on the memory and thinking tests -- especially those who enjoyed problem-solving activities like puzzles.</p><p>That was true even when the researchers factored in childhood intelligence and education level.</p><p>The results were published Dec. 10 in the <i>BMJ</i> journal.</p><p>Staff agreed that the findings do not prove a cause-and-effect link. But, he said, they do support the importance of feeding the mind -- ideally starting early in life.</p><p>\"Have a hungry mind,\" Staff advised. \"It's like money in the cognitive bank.\"</p><p>But is it ever \"too late\" for older adults to take up chess or crosswords?</p><p>Fargo said there's not enough evidence to answer that question. But, he stressed, research does suggest that adults can help protect their brain health through various lifestyle choices.</p><p>Those include exercising regularly, eating healthfully, not smoking, getting enough sleep -- and, yes, staying mentally active.</p><p>And if you don't like puzzles, find something else that uses your mental skills in a fun way.</p><p>\"Most people do get some enjoyment from challenging themselves,\" Fargo said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Alzheimer's Association suggests <a href=\"https://www.alz.org/help-support/brain_health/10_ways_to_love_your_brain\" target=\"_new\">10 Ways to Love Your Brain</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 26, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The wheezy lung disease asthma is yet one more problem linked to excess weight in childhood, a new study suggests. </p><p>The research contends that as many as 10 percent of pediatric asthma cases in the United States could be avoided if childhood obesity were eliminated. </p><p>\"There are very few preventable risk factors for asthma -- obesity may actually be the only one. About 6 to 8 million kids have asthma, so if 10 percent of these cases were removed (by eradicating obesity) that would be up to 800,000 kids without asthma,\" said the study's lead author, Dr. Jason Lang. </p><p>He's an associate professor with Duke University School of Medicine's  division of allergy, immunology and pulmonary medicine, in Durham, N.C. </p><p>About 18 percent of children in the United States are obese. This can impair their quality of life and boost the risk of chronic illnesses, the study authors said. </p><p>Although adult asthma and obesity have been linked, there's been debate about whether obesity is a factor in childhood asthma, the researchers explained. The current study sought to address some of the concerns with previous research, Lang said. </p><p>The new research looked at data from more than a half-million children and about 19 million doctors' visits. These visits took place at one of six major children's health centers across the United States. </p><p>The children were diagnosed with asthma at two or more doctor's appointments. They were also given lung function tests (a step missing in some previous research), and a prescription, such as an inhaler, to treat their asthma. </p><p>Children who were obese were 30 percent more likely to be diagnosed with asthma. Kids who were overweight had a 17 percent increased risk of asthma, the findings showed. </p><p>How could excess weight lead to asthma? </p><p>No one knows for sure yet. And this study doesn't prove a cause-and-effect relationship. </p><p> But there are several theories, Lang said. One is that children who are obese may have alterations in lung growth that might lead to smaller airways, which would allow for more airflow obstruction. It's possible that obesity can lead to changes that make the lungs more over-reactive, he  suggested. </p><p>Lang said it's also possible that other conditions linked to obesity -- such as acid reflux or sleep apnea -- might contribute to asthma. \"Or, it may not be that it's just one thing. It may be a combination,\" he said. </p><p>Dr. Sophia Jan, chief of pediatrics at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y., said the link between the two conditions isn't clear, but inflammation caused by obesity may play a role. She also suggested that certain genes may underlie both conditions. </p><p>And, finally, \"Once a child has developed obesity, the weight in their chest and upper body probably exerts weight on their lungs, thereby affecting the lung's overall ability to expand and function,\" she said. Jan also suspects that multiple factors link obesity and asthma. </p><p>So, what can parents do? </p><p>According to Lang, \"There is literature that shows when kids and adults do lose weight, their asthma gets much better and may even go away completely.\" </p><p>He noted that physical activity is an important part of any weight loss efforts and suggested kids follow recommended guidelines and get at least an hour a day of activity. </p><p>\"Activity expands the lungs and gives periods of high ventilation. It's healthy for lungs to do that,\" Lang said. </p><p>Jan added that maintaining a healthy weight is healthy for many reasons.</p><p> \"Besides the long-term cardiovascular benefits -- preventing heart disease, stroke and diabetes -- there are numerous short-term benefits, including decreasing the risk of sleep apnea, heartburn, gallstones, muscle and joint pain, poor self-esteem, anxiety and bullying,\" she said. </p><p>And, now, preventing or minimizing the severity of asthma can be added to that list, she noted. </p><p>Results of the study were published online Nov. 26 in <i>Pediatrics</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>To learn more about the connection between weight and asthma, go to the <a href=\"https://www.lung.org/about-us/blog/2016/07/the-link-between-asthma-weight.html\" target=\"_new\">American Lung Association</a>.</p>",

She is a professor of oncology at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, in Washington, D.C.</p><p>These results are good news for the large majority of breast cancer survivors. Most women who received chemotherapy or hormone therapy didn't experience long-term thinking or memory declines related to either their cancer or their treatment, the findings showed.</p><p>\"Our study suggests that, for most older breast cancer patients, chemotherapy and hormonal treatments do not have major adverse effects on cognitive function, at least as measured by our current tests,\" Mandelblatt said.</p><p>Experts have long been concerned that older people might be at increased risk for thinking and memory problems related to cancer treatment, Mandelblatt said.</p><p>Aging is already related to dementia and Alzheimer's disease, she noted, and seniors also face a number of other health problems that affect their ability to think.</p><p>For the study, researchers recruited 344 breast cancer patients between the ages of 60 and 98. These women were compared with 347 healthy women of similar ages, to see whether breast cancer or its treatments spurred any sort of intellectual decline.</p><p>Both groups of women were given a battery of 13 cognitive tests at the beginning of the study, before cancer patients received any treatment. They were re-tested one and two years later.</p><p>Tests showed that women treated with hormone therapy suffered no long-term cognitive problems, whether or not they carried the APOE4 gene.</p><p>But breast cancer patients with the APOE4 gene did experience a notable decline in thinking and memory if they received chemotherapy, the researchers reported.</p><p>\"The APOE4 gene is a very strong genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease,\" Mandelblatt said. \"There's probably some interaction between chemotherapy and something this gene controls, but we're very careful to say this finding needs to be replicated. We also need to take this into the laboratory so we can understand better the mechanisms and pathways.\"</p><p>Only 20 percent to 25 percent of people are APOE4-positive, Mandelblatt said, and fewer than 30 percent of older breast cancer patients receive chemotherapy.</p><p>And she emphasized that the mental declines observed were not large.</p><p>\"The types of cognitive changes we observed even in this group who were at genetic risk, these changes were reasonably mild and not of the magnitude you see in Alzheimer's disease,\" Mandelblatt said. \"We don't want women to worry that they're going to have severe memory problems. These were mild declines in cognitive abilities.\"</p><p>So, it's too soon to include the APOE4 gene in discussions about breast cancer treatment, Mandelblatt stressed.</p><p>\"It needs more research before we can make a recommendation like that,\" Mandelblatt concluded. \"The primary consideration for women in choosing their treatment is to survive their cancer. If their cancer is more advanced, they're going to want to choose the most aggressive treatment so they survive their disease.\"</p><p>One cancer expert agreed.</p><p>The current trend is to use chemotherapy less often in treating breast cancer patients, given recent findings that show it's often not needed, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society.</p><p>\"On the other side of the equation, women whose breast cancer has recurred may require chemotherapy, and there may not be an option to avoid it even with the presence of this gene,\" Lichtenfeld said.</p><p>More research and discussion are needed before treatment guidelines are changed to take into account the APOE4 gene, Lichtenfeld said.</p><p>\"It's very rare we immediately change course on what we do,\" Lichtenfeld said. \"We certainly need perhaps more research and certainly more discussion before routinely testing women for the presence of that gene.\"</p><p>The study was published Oct. 4 in the <i>Journal of Clinical Oncology</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Aging has more about <a href=\" https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-disease-genetics-fact-sheet \" target=\"_new\">genetics and Alzheimer's disease</a>.</p>",

But this new report says an additional 14 million youngsters ages 11 to 12 would have to be vaccinated in the next eight years to reach that objective.</p><p>Reaching the 80 percent goal \"has the potential to prevent deaths from several cancers,\" said investigators led by Stacey Fedewa, director of screening and risk factor surveillance for the American Cancer Society.</p><p>In 2016, almost 36 percent of females and nearly 32 percent of males were up to date with the HPV vaccine by their 13th birthday. To reach 80 percent by 2026, the researchers determined that 6.77 million more girls and an additional 7.62 million boys would need to receive two doses of the vaccine, the researchers found.</p><p>A disproportionate percentage of males, whites and privately insured adolescents are not up to date with HPV vaccination, according to the study. </p><p>HPV accounts for nearly all cervical cancers as well as 91 percent of anal cancers, 70 percent of throat cancers, and 60 to 75 percent of other genital cancers, the study authors explained.</p><p>The sexually transmitted virus led to about 6,500 cancer deaths in 2014. Nine out of 10 of these cancers can be prevented through HPV vaccination, the cancer society said.</p><p>\"In our study, more than 90 percent of adolescents who had not initiated HPV vaccination by their 13th birthday had an 11- to 12-year-old wellness visit,\" Fedewa said in a news release from her organization.</p><p>\"So most adolescents presumably had an opportunity to be vaccinated during this time frame. Why it's not happening is a critical question,\" she said.</p><p>Fedewa said previous studies have shown that only about half of parents have been advised to vaccinate their child against HPV.</p><p>\"Broad implementation of the vaccine through innovative strategies for improving physician recommendations, parental acceptance, and access to care is necessary to achieve this goal,\" the study authors said.</p><p>The study was published online recently in the journal <i>Cancer</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/parents/vaccine.html\" target=\"_new\">HPV vaccination</a>.</p>",

They included polypropylene used in bottle caps, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) used in drink bottles, polystyrene found in plastic utensils and cups, and polyethylene used in plastic bags and storage containers.</p><p>Schwabl said he found the data \"astonishing.\"</p><p>\"I believe that trying to reduce plastic usage and plastic-packed food might be beneficial for nature and for us,\" Schwabl said. \"Certainly, plastic is a very useful material and has a lot of clever applications. But maybe we should try to rethink about the necessity of abundant plastic use, and search for and support ecological and sustainable alternatives.\"</p><p>It's too soon to tell whether these plastic particles could harm people, Schwabl and other experts said.</p><p>\"We're seeing increasing evidence that it's in people. Now we need to think about how it will impact human health,\" said Dr. Kenneth Spaeth, chief of occupational and environmental medicine at Northwell Health in Great Neck, N.Y. \"We know that plastics contain an array of potentially harmful substances that in other contexts we know can leach out and potentially affect human health.\"</p><p>The new study follows a report last week that microplastics can be found in 90 percent of table salt. Salt samples from 21 countries in Europe, North and South America, Africa and Asia were analyzed; of 39 salt brands tested, 36 contained microplastics, the <i>National Geographic</i> reported.</p><p>For the stool study, Schwabl and his team recruited one test subject each from Finland, the Netherlands, Poland, Austria, Italy, the United Kingdom, Russia and Japan. The group consisted of three women and five men ranging in age from 33 to 65.</p><p>Each person kept a food diary during the week before they provided a stool sample. The diaries showed that all participants had consumed plastic-wrapped foods or drank from plastic bottles. Six had consumed ocean fish.</p><p>Lab tests found microplastic particles from 9 out of 10 plastic types, with sizes ranging from 50 to 500 microns. A human hair has a diameter of about 50 microns.</p><p>Other plastic types included polyoxymethylene (car parts and food industry), polycarbonate (construction and electronics), nylon (rope, fishing nets and textiles) and polyurethane (ship varnish, construction and auto parts).</p><p>There are a couple of ways these plastic particles could be winding up inside of people, Schwabl suggested.</p><p>Microplastics to wind up in food through plastic packaging, or could enter the food chain by being eaten by sea life, he said.</p><p>\"In our study, most participants drank liquids from plastic bottles, but also fish and seafood ingestion was common,\" Schwabl noted.</p><p>There are no human studies that show how microplastics might affect human health, Schwabl said. But animal studies have shown that microplastic particles are capable of entering the blood stream, lymphatic system and liver.</p><p>Inside the gut, the microplastics could cause intestinal damage or alter the shape of the villi that line the intestinal wall, said Dr. Arun Swaminath, director of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>There's also some concern regarding the endocrine-disrupting chemicals contained in these plastics, Spaeth said. Human studies have found that these chemicals can leach from plastics into the food people eat or into the dust in the air.</p><p>\"Obviously, having it in our digestive tract, the potential for direct exposure could potentially be greater,\" Spaeth said.</p><p>The findings were presented Monday at the United European Gastroenterology annual meeting in Vienna. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>Schwabl and his team hope to do larger follow-up studies to verify their findings and to further explore the possible effects on human health.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency has more about <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/trash-free-waters/epa-reports\" target=\"_new\">plastics and health</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 27, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- If you've got a sweet tooth, but you're worried about type 2 diabetes, you might want to skip sugary drinks. </p><p>New research suggests that drinking sugar-sweetened beverages, such as cola, likely boost your risk of type 2 diabetes much more than the sugar found in fruit or even 100 percent fruit juices. </p><p>\"All foods are not created equal,\" said study author Dr. John Sievenpiper, an associate professor and staff physician at the University of Toronto and St. Michael's Hospital in Canada.</p><p>\"We synthesized all of the available trials looking at different food sources of sugar and blood sugar control, and sugar-sweetened beverages really stand out as having an adverse effect,\" he explained. </p><p> Sievenpiper said that 100 percent fruit juice can be healthful if it doesn't add excess calories to the diet.</p><p>\"Fruit juice can complement fruit and vegetable intake,\" he noted, \"but if you use fruit juices to stay hydrated, there is some risk.\" </p><p>Meanwhile, fruit appeared to have a protective effect on blood sugar levels, along with providing important nutrients and fiber, he said.</p><p>The effects of sugar in the diet have been hotly debated for decades. In recent years, the debate has been reignited by the parallels between the consumption of high-fructose corn syrup (a concentrated form of sugar used in many products, including soft drinks) and the rise of obesity and diabetes in the United States, according to the study authors. </p><p>To see if the type of sugars consumed has an effect on type 2 diabetes risk, the researchers reviewed data from 155 nutritional studies. All looked at the effects of foods on blood sugar levels in people with and without diabetes. The studies monitored volunteers for as long as 12 weeks. </p><p>The investigators found that fruits and fruit juices seemed to have beneficial effects on insulin and blood sugar control, especially in people with diabetes, as long as they didn't provide excess calories in the diet. So, if someone needs 2,000 calories a day to maintain their weight, a small glass of orange juice that doesn't cause that person to go over 2,000 calories is probably fine. </p><p>But foods that contain few nutrients, such as sugar-sweetened beverages, and fruit juice that provide excess calories in the diet seem to have harmful effects on blood sugar levels, the researchers said. </p><p>\"If you consider your daily caloric allotment, you don't have a lot of calories to spare, so it's important to think about what a food is giving you. Foods that don't have redeemable qualities like fiber should really be considered discretionary foods. Sugar-sweetened beverages are just pure calories,\" Sievenpiper said. </p><p>It's important to consider the whole food, he explained. For example, if you're eating a high-fiber cereal that has a little bit of sugar, \"that's probably OK,\" he said. </p><p>Registered dietician Samantha Heller from NYU Langone Health reviewed the findings.</p><p>\"Sugars from natural sources like fruits are part of a healthy diet and necessary for life -- we need it for fuel for cells and muscles. What we don't need are highly processed foods. We need to eat less highly processed foods. We're better off with real foods,\" she said. </p><p>\"It's all about balance. Fruits are part of a healthy, balanced diet. They're loaded with antioxidants and fiber, but like any other food, fruit can become a problem when we eat it in excess,\" Heller added. </p><p>The review was published online recently in the <i>BMJ</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about sugars in foods from the <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/sugar-101\" target=\"_new\">American Heart Association</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Oct. 11, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Before he stood in rooms at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas interpreting between Spanish-speaking patients and English-speaking health care providers, Cruz Ramirez did so informally as a child.</p> <p>When his parents and grandparents couldn't understand a diagnosis or information being delivered by doctors, young Ramirez was the messenger. Today, in his role as a professional medical interpreter, he can pinpoint the mistakes he made as a kid in conveying medical details to his family.</p> <p>\"At the beginning, I wasn't very fluent (in English),\" said Ramirez. \"So a lot of things I didn't understand.\"</p> <p>He uses that experience to help doctors, nurses and other providers communicate with patients. He also encourages patients to request the help of an interpreter if they need or want one.</p> <p>Having information in their native language is especially critical for people having a stroke, the fifth-leading cause of death among Americans and a main cause of disability among adults. Getting treatment soon after symptoms begin may mean the difference between being able to walk, talk and write afterward -- and not.</p> <p>But for patients who don't speak English well, a good recovery may depend on more than seeing a doctor quickly.</p> <p>Dr. Alejandro Magad&aacute;n is an acute stroke specialist at UT Southwestern Medical Center and Parkland Memorial Hospital. The vascular neurologist said stroke patients who've needed an interpreter but aren't provided one don't understand their health condition and don't take the medications prescribed to stave off another stroke.</p> <p>Generally, Magad&aacute;n said, those patients have a poor quality of life because \"they're going to keep coming back with more problems.\"</p> <p>Providers who don't offer a professional medical interpreter to patients who need one may deprive them of quality care, he said.</p> <p>Research appears to support that view.</p> <p>A 2017 study found that among acute stroke patients who preferred to speak to clinicians in another language, only 57 percent received the services of an interpreter, and those who weren't provided with an interpreter were less likely to receive quality care. A review of research going back at least 20 years found that professional medical interpreters help avoid misunderstandings between patients and their doctors, and leave patients more satisfied with their care.</p> <p>An estimated 23.6 million American adults have limited English-language proficiency, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. For them, federal regulations require hospitals, clinics, nursing homes and other medical service providers that receive federal funding to make reasonable efforts to help people with limited English skills have health care information in their native language.</p> <p>Yet those rules aren't always followed.</p> <p>At Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, neurologist Dr. Nicte I. Mejia said some colleagues hesitate to request professional medical interpreters because they worry the process will slow down their busy schedules. But Mejia tells her staff that interpreters are assets because they help relay accurate information and prevent mistakes, such as a patient not understanding how to take a medication.</p> <p>Medical interpreters, she said, are well-versed in medical terminology and ethical practice standards, and can communicate cultural nuances that doctors or patients may easily miss. There are also legal and privacy issues to consider, she said.</p> <p>\"At the end of the day, involving professional medical interpreters will help patients get safer, faster, better care,\" said Mejia, senior author of the 2017 study.</p> <p>But Ramirez said there's something else professional medical interpreters provide: comfort.</p> <p>\"Just going to the doctor is scary enough for anybody,\" he said.</p>",

The only way we can measure loneliness is to ask. Usually we ask a series of questions that are part of scales to get at loneliness,\" Emerson said.</p><p>Loneliness can be difficult to treat because its causes and remedies vary from person to person.</p><p>\"At its heart, loneliness is a personalized issue, and every solution is an individualized solution,\" Emerson said. \"There are therapies that can help people who need to build social skills.

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Jan. 3, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- If  you have type 2 diabetes and you're taking canagliflozin to help control your blood sugar, a new study has some good news for you: The drug doesn't appear to raise the risk of bone fractures. </p><p>Previously, research had suggested this might be the case.</p><p>\"We were interested in doing this study because there was one randomized trial that said there was an increased risk of bone fractures and another that said there wasn't. So, we conducted a real-world study with almost 200,000 people with type 2 diabetes,\" said study author Dr. Michael Fralick.</p><p>\"I hope these findings are reassuring to patients and physicians because these are blockbuster medications for type 2 diabetes. This class of medicines can improve blood sugar levels and help reduce heart disease risk,\" he said. Fralick is from the division of pharmacoepidemiology and pharmacoeconomics at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, and a general internist at the University of Toronto. </p><p>Canagliflozin (Invokana, Invokamet) is one drug in a class of medications called SGLT-2 inhibitors. Other drugs in this class include dapagliflozin (Farxiga) and empagliflozin (Jardiance).</p><p>These drugs cause the kidneys to remove excess sugar from the blood and excrete it through urine, which lowers blood sugar levels, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This class of drugs has been linked to a number of complications, including kidney injury and serious genital infections.</p><p>Fralick said one way these drugs could potentially increase fracture risk is by lowering bone mineral density.</p><p>Dr. William Leslie, author of an editorial accompanying the study, suggested that dehydration may be another way these drugs might be linked to fracture risk. Leslie is a professor of medicine and radiology at the University of Manitoba in Canada.</p><p>For the new report, Fralick and his team reviewed data from two U.S. commercial health care databases. They found information on about 200,000 people with type 2 diabetes who were just starting to take one of two different type 2 diabetes medications -- canagliflozin or a medication in a class of drugs called GLP-1 agonists, which includes Victoza, Trulicity and Byetta. These drugs haven't been linked to an increased risk of fractures. </p><p>The researchers looked for fractures in the upper and lower arms, as well as the hips and pelvis. </p><p>In the end, the study team compared approximately 80,000 people on canagliflozin to about 80,000 treated with GLP-1 agonists. The patients' average age was 55, and about 48 percent were female. </p><p>The study showed a similar risk of fractures in these low-risk, middle-aged populations.</p><p>Both Fralick and Leslie said the jury is still out for people who are at a higher risk of fractures, such as elderly people. </p><p>This study is \"a relatively low-risk population. But, it begs the question, what about higher-risk populations? We need additional safety data,\" Leslie said.</p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration currently requires canagliflozin labels to carry a warning about the potential fracture risk, and Fralick said it may be too soon to change the labeling, particularly for people at high risk. Both experts said more research is needed.</p><p>In the meantime, if you're concerned about taking canagliflozin, Fralick recommended having a conversation with your health care provider. But, he added, \"For people without a high baseline risk, the risk of fracture is very small and the clear benefits to SGLT-2s outweigh that potential risk.\" </p><p>The findings were published online Jan. 1 in the <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about oral diabetes medications from the <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/treatment-and-care/medication/oral-medications/what-are-my-options.html\" target=\"_new\">American Diabetes Association</a>.</p>",

For example, in the early 1970s, colon cancer death rates were 20 percent lower in poor counties, and today they are 35 percent higher, when compared with people living in richer counties, Siegel said.</p><p>\"Differences in wealth lead to differences in risk factors and less access to high-quality care for prevention, early detection and treatment,\" she explained.</p><p>In addition, poor people are less likely to be screened for cancer, and so cancer is likely to be diagnosed at an advanced stage that makes treatment problematic. Plus, care for the poor is not as good as that given to the rich, Siegel said.</p><p>Where the poor have access to screening, these disparities can be eliminated, she suggested. \"We have seen this in Massachusetts and Washington, D.C.,\" she said.</p><p>In addition, more education is called for to help people understand the steps they can take to lower their risk for cancer. \"Health literacy is an issue,\" Siegel said.</p><p>The report was published online Jan. 8 in <i>CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians</i>. </p><p>According to Electra Paskett, co-program leader of the cancer control program at Ohio State University's Comprehensive Cancer Center, \"The people who suffer the most are impacted by social determinants of health, which include where they live, their socioeconomic condition, their education, their income.\" </p><p>Poor people face so many problems just living day-to-day. And when they are confronted by cancer, they often don't have the access to the latest treatments, Paskett explained.</p><p>The new report noted that nearly 2 million Americans will be diagnosed with cancer this year, and more than 600,000 will die of the disease. But the cancer death rate has actually been dropping nearly 2 percent a year, from 215 deaths per 100,000 in 1991 to 156 per 100,000 in 2016.</p><p>Between 1990 and 2016, deaths from lung cancer among men dropped 48 percent, and deaths from breast cancer among women decreased 40 percent. From 1993 to 2016, deaths from prostate cancer dropped 51 percent,  and from 1970 to 2016, deaths from colon cancer plummeted 53 percent, the researchers reported.</p><p> Siegel noted that \"lung cancer still kills more Americans than breast, prostate and colon cancer combined.\"</p><p>Deaths from some cancers, however, rose. For example, deaths from liver cancer increased each  year among men and women. Pancreatic cancer deaths rose slightly among men. Brain cancer deaths also rose each year. Other cancer deaths on the rise are soft-tissue cancers (such as heart) and oral cancers linked to the human papillomavirus (HPV).</p><p>Although a vaccine for HPV is available, Paskett said, too few girls and boys are being vaccinated. The vaccine can prevent 70 percent of cervical cancers as well as many oral cancers and genital warts.</p><p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death after heart disease, the researchers reported. But cancer is the leading cause of death in many states and among Hispanics, Asian Americans and people under 80 years of age.</p><p>For cancers such as leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, pancreatic and ovarian cancers, death rates vary only slightly between the rich and poor, the investigators found.</p><p>The study authors also said that cases of melanoma have been increasing, as well as cases of liver, thyroid, uterine and pancreatic cancer.</p><p> Paskett pointed out that \"we have made great strides. But we have a long way to go.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/what-is-cancer\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Cancer Institute</a> for more on cancer.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Jan. 15, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- A stem cell transplant may help some people with multiple sclerosis (MS) when standard drugs fail, a new clinical trial finds.</p><p>The study focused on 110 patients with aggressive cases of MS: Their symptoms had flared up at least twice in the past year despite taking standard medication, and they'd already tried an average of three of those drugs.</p><p>Researchers randomly assigned the patients to either keep trying other medications or have a stem cell transplant -- using cells taken from their own blood.</p><p>Over an average of three years, MS progressed in 34 of 55 patients on medication -- meaning their disabilities worsened. That compared with only three of 55 patients given a stem cell transplant.</p><p>It's a striking difference, said lead researcher Dr. Richard Burt, adding that the results were even better than his team anticipated.</p><p>That said, Burt cautioned that only a small minority of MS patients would be possible transplant candidates. And for now, only certain medical centers have the necessary experience and expertise.</p><p>\"Any treatment that is powerful can also be dangerous,\" said Burt, who is chief of immunotherapy and autoimmune diseases at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. \"You don't want to use it too soon, or too late. And you don't want to overuse it.\"</p><p>Those precautions were echoed by Bruce Bebo, executive director of research for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.</p><p>\"This study should be celebrated,\" said Bebo, who was not involved in the research. \"It's the first randomized, controlled clinical trial of this strategy.\"</p><p>But, he stressed, the treatment is still experimental and can only be done safely at a handful of centers around the world. </p><p>Stem cell transplants are done at many hospitals to treat cancer. But, Bebo said, there's an \"art and science\" to using them for MS.</p><p>MS is a neurological disorder caused by a misguided immune system attack on the body's own myelin -- the protective sheath around nerve fibers in the spine and brain. Depending on where the damage occurs, symptoms include vision problems, muscle weakness, numbness and difficulty with balance and coordination.</p><p>About 85 percent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with the \"relapsing-remitting\" form of the disease, according to the National MS Society. That means symptoms flare up for a time and then ease. But most people eventually transition to a progressive form of the disease and their disability worsens over time.</p><p>The new trial included only patients with relapsing-remitting MS, because that point in the disease is when immune system inflammation is inflicting its damage.</p><p>Why would a stem cell transplant help? The idea, Burt explained, is to basically \"reboot\" the immune system and stop it from attacking.</p><p>Stem cells from the bone marrow are the building blocks of the immune system. In this trial, patients had a supply of their own bone marrow stem cells removed and stored, then underwent a few days of chemotherapy to knock down their existing immune system.</p><p>After that, the stored stem cells were infused back into the body, where over time, the immune system rebuilt itself.</p><p>Half of the study patients had that procedure. The other half continued with disease-modifying drugs -- like natalizumab (Tysabri), interferon (Avonex) and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone). Those medications can slow, but not stop, MS progression, Burt said.</p><p>Over the next few years, stem cell transplant patients were much less likely to see their MS progress, the study found.</p><p>\"And, Burt said, \"their quality of life markedly improved.\"</p><p>When patients rated their quality of life on a standard scale, the transplant group reported an average 20-point gain one year later. Those ratings dipped a few points among patients on medication.</p><p>The study, published in the Jan. 15 issue of the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>, was funded by government and foundation grants.</p><p>Burt cautioned that stem cell transplants carry risks, including serious, even fatal, infections while the immune system is suppressed. No patient in this trial died.</p><p>Bebo also pointed out that the study patients did not take the newest MS drugs, such as a medication called Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), which was approved after this trial ended in 2016.</p><p>\"It's unclear how stem cell transplants compare with the most effective current drug therapies,\" Bebo said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The National MS Society has more on <a href=\"https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Research/Research-News-Progress/Stem-Cells-in-MS/Bone-Marrow-Stem-Cell-Transplant-%E2%80%93-HSCT\" target=\"_new\"> stem cell transplants</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, March 14, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- People whose high cholesterol is resistant to treatment with statin drugs may soon have a new treatment option.</p><p>This new class of drugs helps block synthesis of artery-clogging cholesterol, researchers explained. The drugs target an enzyme called ATP citrate lyase (ACL), part of the production pathway for \"bad\" LDL cholesterol in the body.</p><p>In the new trial, bempedoic acid, a pill that blocks ACL, reduced LDL cholesterol levels significantly when added to standard statin therapy.</p><p>The addition of bempedoic acid on top of a statin drug showed \"a much greater reduction in LDL-C than what would be expected simply by increasing the dose of statin therapy,\" said study author Dr. Brian Ference. He directs translational therapeutics research at the University of Cambridge in England.</p><p>His team published its findings in the March 14 issue of <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p>But experts aren't certain how useful bempedoic acid might be, given the wide cholesterol-lowering arsenal now available to heart doctors.</p><p>The clinical trial results represent \"a rather modest reduction as compared to statins, which lower LDL cholesterol concentrations on average by 20 to 30 percent, and newer drugs such as PCSK9 inhibitors, which can lower LDL cholesterol concentrations by over 50 percent,\" said Dr. Michael Holmes. He's an associate professor at the University of Oxford in England, and wrote an editorial accompanying the study.</p><p>Bempedoic acid also doesn't appear to outperform ezetimibe (Zetia), a drug already on the market, said Dr. Robert Eckel, who holds an endowed chair in atherosclerosis at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Aurora.</p><p>An earlier clinical trial has shown that combining bempedoic acid and ezetimibe lowered LDL cholesterol by about 28 percent more than placebo, said Eckel, an expert with the American Heart Association who was not involved with the new study.</p><p>\"It suggests that adding ezetimibe, which is typically an 18 to 20 percent reduction, to bempedoic acid only produces a modest additional benefit,\" Eckel said. \"It's not like the 40 percent you would expect.\"</p><p>The body uses ACL further upstream in the same cholesterol synthesis process that also employs the enzyme targeted by statins, known as HMGCR, researchers said in background notes.</p><p>A study of nearly 655,000 people found that people's ACL and HMGCR scores were associated with similar patterns in LDL cholesterol levels and similar effects on heart disease risk based on those levels, researchers reported. Ference led this study.</p><p>Further, people who carry genetic variants that inhibit ACL have lower LDL cholesterol levels and lower risk of heart health problems, researchers found.</p><p>Based on this, researchers decided to test how well a drug that blocks ACL would lower cholesterol levels in average people.</p><p>That drug, bempedoic acid, was randomly assigned to 1,488 people with high LDL cholesterol despite being on high-intensity statin therapy. Another 742 statin users were given a placebo.</p><p>After a year, bempedoic acid lowered LDL cholesterol levels by 18 percentage points, researchers found.</p><p>The most troubling adverse event was the incidence of gout, which led 18 bempedoic acid patients to quit the trial, compared to three placebo patients, Holmes and Eckel said.</p><p>Gout occurs when uric acid levels rise in the bloodstream beyond the kidneys' ability to remove the harmful byproduct. High uric acid levels cause crystals to form in joints, producing inflammation and arthritis.</p><p>\"This discontinuation because of gout is something that needs to be explored further by additional study,\" Eckel said. \"That could end up to be something on the package insert that could influence prescribing patterns.\"</p><p>For example, bempedoic acid might not be best prescribed to people with gout or with already elevated uric acid levels, he said.</p><p>The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology's updated cholesterol treatment guidelines in 2018 kept the main focus on statins, which are cheap and proven effective.</p><p>But the AHA and ACC also allowed that ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors could play a role for people whose cholesterol remains elevated despite statin therapy.</p><p>\"In the setting of patients at high risk of disease who are on maximal doses of statins, additional lipid-lowering drugs will lead to a further reduction in cardiovascular disease risk, as we have seen with PCSK9 inhibitors,\" said Holmes.</p> <p>\"There is therefore a potential role for drugs that inhibit ACL, such as bempedoic acid, in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease,\" he said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart Association has more about <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cholesterol/prevention-and-treatment-of-high-cholesterol-hyperlipidemia/cholesterol-medications\" target=\"_new\">cholesterol medications</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Jan. 2, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- For many, the start of the new year signals the start of a new diet. But what's the best way to eat if you want to lose weight?</p><p>For overall healthy eating, the best diet plan is the Mediterranean diet, according to <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report's</i> annual diet review. The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet was ranked second on the magazine's overall Best Diets 2019 list, followed by the Flexitarian plan. All three plans focus on eating a mostly plant-based diet (veggies, fruits and whole grains), healthy fats and lean protein sources. </p><p>\"I hope these rankings steer people in the direction of doing something healthful,\" said nutritionist Samantha Heller of NYU Langone Health in New York City. </p><p>\"I wish though, that we weren't so obsessed with weight loss and diets, per se. I wish the focus was on adopting a healthy lifestyle, like eating a more plant-based diet, getting regular exercise, getting enough sleep and managing stress, all of which help us live a better quality of life,\" Heller said. </p><p>To that end, she said the top three diets are all similar in their food content, and all can be healthy eating regimens.</p><p>The Mediterranean diet has been linked to increased longevity and a decreased risk of chronic illnesses, the report said. The Mediterranean diet was also ranked high in multiple categories including: Easiest Diets to Follow, Best Diets for Healthy Eating, Best Diets for Diabetes, and Best Diets for Hearth Health.</p><p>If weight loss is part of your plans, here are plans that topped the rankings for the best weight-loss plans:</p><ul><li>WW (Weight Watchers)</li><li>Volumetrics</li><li>Flexitarian diet (tie)</li><li>Jenny Craig (tie)</li><li>Vegan diet (tie)</li></ul><p>Feel the need to knock off some pounds quickly?  Here are the best fast weight-loss plans:</p><ul><li>HMR program</li><li>Atkins (tie) </li><li>Keto diet (tie) </li><li>Optavia (tie) </li><li>WW (Weight Watchers) (tie)</li></ul><p>Heller said that many people feel that they need to \"kickstart\" their weight loss for motivation. The problem with plans that focus on fast weight loss, however, is that they don't teach you how to eat well every day.</p><p> \"On these types of diets, you often don't learn how to manage holidays, stressful days or special occasions. You don't develop strategies for life,\" she said.</p><p>The easiest diets to follow include the Mediterranean diet, the Flexitarian diet and WW (Weight Watchers). </p><p>The magazine asked a panel of nutrition experts to review 41 diet plans. Like Heller, the expert panelists emphasized the importance of well-balanced, sustainable diets that aren't overly restrictive. These types of diets can help teach lifelong positive eating habits.</p><p>Lifestyle diets, such as the Mayo Clinic diet and MIND diet, are healthier and more sustainable than weight-loss plans such as the Ketogenic or Atkins diet are, the panelists concluded.</p><p>Although the popular Keto diet ranked high for fast weight loss, it landed way down on the Best Diets list -- tying for number 38. Other diets at the bottom of the list included the Dukan diet, the Body Reset Diet and the Whole30 diet. </p><p>\"I think that diets that don't differentiate between healthy and unhealthy fats, over time are ultimately an unhealthy approach to losing weight,\" Heller said.</p><p>But the diet topping any list isn't necessarily the best diet for you. Choosing a diet is a \"very individual thing,\" Heller noted, adding that you have to find a diet plan that works well for you. And, hopefully one that teaches you to eat healthy for life. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about the U.S. News &amp; World Report's <a href=\"https://health.usnews.com/best-diet\" target=\"_new\">best diet rankings</a>.</p>",

Flavor merely enhances a food or beverage to increase consumption,\" said Zarabi, who directs the bariatric program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>A group representing sugar-free sweetener makers disputed the findings, however.</p><p>\"Despite the authors' claims to the contrary, the highest quality scientific evidence shows that the consumption of low- and no-calorie sweeteners results in reductions in body weight, does not lead to weight gain and does not cause cravings,\" the Calorie Control Council said in a statement.</p><p>The Council pointed to two prior large reviews -- published in the <i>International Journal of Obesity</i> and the <i>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</i> -- that they say came to the opposite conclusion of the new German analysis.</p><p>Meerpohl's team also did not rule out that non-sugar sweeteners might still show some benefit in future trials. They believe better, longer studies are needed to determine once and for all that these products are a safe and effective alternative to sugar.</p><p>Zarabi said she's seen no help from calorie-free sweeteners in her practice, however, and even potential harm.</p><p>\"I work with a wide variety of patients with health ailments. I have those suffering with anorexia drinking Diet Coke all day unable to gain a pound, and obese diabetics drinking the same beverage with out-of-control blood sugar levels and difficulty losing weight,\" she said. </p><p>\"It's not specifically the diet soda (made with alternative sweeteners) that's responsible for their health outcomes, more so it's the other sources of calories and sugar,\" Zarabi said. \"You must look at the whole diet and lifestyle to conclude any sufficient evidence of sugars, nutritive or not, and effect on disease.\"</p><p>The report was funded by the World Health Organization and was published online Jan. 2 in the <i>BMJ</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on artificial sweeteners, visit <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/artificial-sweeteners-sugar-free-but-at-what-cost-201207165030/\" target=\"_new\"> Harvard Medical School</a>.</p>",

That was about 25 percent more than second-place Switzerland's $7,919 and more than twice as high as Canada's $4,753, researchers found.</p><p>It was also twice what Americans spent in 2000, and 145 percent higher than the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) median of $4,033. The OECD includes 34 countries.</p><p>\"In spite of all the efforts in the U.S. to control health spending over the past 25 years, the story remains the same -- the U.S. remains the most expensive because of the prices the U.S. pays for health services,\" said study author Gerard Anderson. He's a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.</p><p>\"It's not that we're getting more; it's that we're paying much more,\" Anderson said in a school news release.</p><p>Evaluating the drivers behind soaring U.S. spending, his team cited higher drug prices, higher salaries for doctors and nurses, higher hospital administration costs and higher prices for many medical services.</p><p>Despite those higher costs, Americans have less access to many health care services than residents of other OECD countries, according to the study.</p><p>In 2015, for example, there were 7.9 practicing nurses and 2.6 practicing physicians for every 1,000 Americans, compared to the OECD medians of 9.9 nurses and 3.2 physicians.</p><p>That year, the United States had only 7.5 new medical school graduates per 100,000 people compared to the OECD median of 12.1. And the nation had just 2.5 acute care hospital beds per 1,000 people compared to the OECD median of 3.4.</p><p>Yet the United States ranked second in the number of MRI machines per person and third in the number of CT scanners per person, suggesting relatively high use of these expensive resources. (Japan ranked first in both categories, but was one of the lowest overall health care spenders in the OECD in 2016).</p><p>Among the other findings:</p><ul><li>U.S. health spending outpaced that of the other OECD countries between 2000 and 2016 -- growing an average of 2.8 percent a year compared with the OECD median annual increase of 2.6 percent.</li><li>Inflation-adjusted spending on pharmaceuticals rose 3.8 percent annually in the United States versus an OECD median of 1.1 percent.</li><li>In 2016, U.S. health care spending accounted for more than 17 percent of gross domestic product, compared with an OECD median of less than 9 percent.</li></ul><p>The findings appear in the January issue of the journal <i>Health Affairs</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Kaiser Family Foundation has more on <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-costs/\" target=\"_new\">health costs</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, May 1, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Hormone-based treatment might improve social function in people with autism, a pair of new clinical trials suggests.</p><p>Both focused on vasopressin, a hormone that has been implicated in the brain's ability to manage social behavior.</p><p>In the first trial, vasopressin given as a nasal spray helped improve social responsiveness in kids with autism, said lead researcher Karen Parker. She is director of Stanford University's Social Neurosciences Research Program.</p><p>\"The parents saw improvement, the clinicians saw improvement, and the children's performance on lab tests also improved with vasopressin compared to placebo,\" Parker said.</p><p>The second clinical trial did not involve vasopressin itself, but a new drug that activates the brain receptors targeted by the hormone, explained senior researcher Dr. Paulo Fontoura. He is senior vice president of neuroscience and rare diseases clinical development at Roche Pharmaceuticals.</p><p>Men with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who took the drug, balovaptan, experienced clinically meaningful improvement in their social behaviors, the researchers reported.</p><p>Balovaptan has the potential \"to improve the core characteristics of social interaction and communications in adults with ASD,\" Fontoura said in a statement.</p><p>According to Parker, prior research in animals and people has shown that vasopressin helps promote social behavior in mammals.</p><p>\"We showed that vasopressin was low in cerebrospinal fluid [among people with autism], and the lower your vasopressin levels, the greater your symptom severity,\" Parker said. \"If we look at where the vasopressin receptors are in the brain, they're in socially relevant areas that have been identified as regulating social functioning.\"</p><p>Parker and her colleagues treated 17 kids with autism with a vasopressin nasal spray and another 13 kids with an inactive placebo spray for four weeks.</p><p>The kids treated with vasopressin showed enhanced social behavior as measured by a standardized test called the Social Responsiveness Scale. They also showed improvement in social communication, were better able to interpret emotional and mental states of others, and had diminished symptoms related to autism, such as anxiety and repetitive behaviors.</p><p>The balovaptan clinical trial involved 223 men with moderate or severe autism, the researchers said.</p><p>The patients were split into four groups, and were given either balovaptan at different doses or a placebo every day for 12 weeks.</p><p>The men did not show significant improvement as measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale, the study authors said.</p><p>But the two patient groups that received higher doses of balovaptan displayed improvements as measured by another scale that assesses socialization, adaptive behavior and daily living skills, compared with those who got a placebo.</p><p>Both vasopressin and balovaptan did not cause any serious side effects and raised no safety concerns, Parker and Fontoura said.</p><p>Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y., has mixed feelings about vasopressin-focused therapy for autism.</p><p>\"These two studies, taken together, suggest that treatments to increase vasopressin levels in the brain may be helpful for some patients with ASD,\" Adesman said. \"However, much more research is needed in terms of the long-term benefits and safety of this type of treatment.\"</p><p>Vasopressin is already available by prescription, as an antidiuretic used to treat overly frequent urination. Because of this, Adesman is concerned that parents might be tempted to seek an off-label prescription from their doctor for their child with autism.</p><p>\"I think families and physicians need to be cautious in using this medication on the basis of a single short-term study,\" Adesman said.</p><p>\"Given that there are very few if any good medication options for the treatment of ASD, I am sure there will be great interest in this novel treatment approach,\" Adesman continued. \"That said, I think much more research is needed before we can feel comfortable recommending vasopressin as a safe and effective treatment for one of the core deficits in children with ASD.\"</p><p>Both studies have proceeded to the next stage of clinical trial.</p><p>Vasopressin currently is being tested in a larger group of 100 children, Parker said.</p><p>Meanwhile, balovaptan is the focus of two clinical trials, a phase II study in children and teenagers and a phase III trial in adults, Fontoura said.</p><p>The latest findings were published May 1 in the journal <i>Science Translational Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institutes of Health has more about <a href=\" https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/autism/conditioninfo/causes \" target=\"_new\">potential causes of autism</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Jan. 8, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Turn on prime-time TV and you'll likely see a pitch for arthritis or impotence pills, and maybe a cancer center. Advertisers spent nearly $10 billion marketing prescription drugs and medical services to the American public in 2016 -- five times what they doled out 20 years earlier, a new study finds.</p><p>Experts said the results raise questions about the influence of advertising over how Americans see their health and make health-care decisions.</p><p>The study analyzed trends in \"medical marketing\" between 1997 and 2016, looking at TV and digital advertising, social media and more.</p><p>Medical marketing includes ads directed to consumers: Many are for prescription drugs, but others tout treatments, tests and various services offered by hospitals, clinics and other health providers. It also includes marketing to doctors by drug companies and lab test manufacturers.</p><p>In 2016, the study found, those advertisers spent almost $30 billion marketing to professionals and the public. That was up two-thirds from 1997, when the figure stood at $17.7 billion.</p><p>And while companies still devote more money to courting providers, spending on consumer ads rose at a much greater rate -- from $2.1 billion in 1997, to $9.6 billion in 2016. The findings were published Jan. 8 in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>.</p><p>\"It's an impressive amount of money -- and it's because companies know it works,\" said study co-author Dr. Steven Woloshin, a professor at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice.</p><p>The problem, said Woloshin, is that by nature, ads tell consumers that the product is \"good.\" Prescription drug ads mention side effects -- in a quick voiceover in a TV commercial, for instance -- but they do not quantify the benefits versus risks.</p><p>\"People don't realize that even though a drug is approved by the [U.S.] Food and Drug Administration, it may only be marginally effective,\" Woloshin said.</p><p>Nor do ads mention the alternatives for treating a particular condition -- which may be cheaper or drug-free, he noted.</p><p>\"That's not to say that marketing is always bad,\" Woloshin pointed out.</p><p>It may help lift the \"stigma\" attached to conditions like HIV or depression, he said, or help people get appropriate tests or treatments.</p><p>There's a flip side, though: overdiagnosis and overtreatment.</p><p>Woloshin mentioned a study where researchers had actors go to primary care doctors portraying symptoms of either major depression or adjustment disorder. Some specifically asked for an antidepressant, citing something they'd seen on TV.</p><p>The result: People who asked for medication were more likely to get it, even when they did not report depression symptoms.</p><p>\"Marketing can have benefits, but also harms,\" Woloshin said. \"That's why we need strong regulation.\"</p><p>However, the study found little evidence that regulation has kept pace with the explosion in marketing. According to Woloshin, the FDA has taken some action in recent years -- to curtail marketing of unapproved genetic tests that promise to reveal your risks of developing various diseases.</p><p>But the public might be surprised by how little regulatory oversight there is, said Meredith Rosenthal, a professor of health economics at the Harvard School of Public Health.</p><p>\"Don't assume an ad has been reviewed and blessed by the FDA,\" said Rosenthal, co-author of an editorial published with the study.</p><p>The FDA can act when an ad's content violates law, she noted. But it does not put a stamp of approval on every ad.</p><p>In theory, Rosenthal said, doctors are the \"bulwark,\" steering patients away from inappropriate treatments, even if they demand them. But, she noted, doctors are targeted by marketers, too, or may advertise services themselves.</p><p>Plus, Woloshin said, even when doctors try to convince patients that lifestyle changes, for example, are a better option, they can end up fighting a losing battle.</p><p>For now, he and Rosenthal suggested the public regard medical ads with a healthy dose of skepticism.</p><p>That includes \"disease awareness campaigns,\" which are often funded by drug companies, Woloshin said. </p><p>Again, Woloshin said, that kind of marketing can have benefits, but also harms when campaigns try to expand a disease definition and \"medicalize\" normal experience. He cited \"low testosterone\" as one example.</p><p>\"Some people say we should ban [medical marketing],\" Woloshin said. \"But that's not going to happen, because of the First Amendment. What we need is stronger regulation.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has a guide for consumers on <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/prescriptiondrugadvertising/default.htm\" target=\"_new\">prescription drug advertising</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 27, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Tim Landis was a healthy 66-year-old who hiked, biked and jogged, wasn't overweight and watched what he ate. But after he died suddenly of a heart attack in January, tests revealed years of untreated high blood pressure that caused cardiovascular disease.</p> <p>At his annual physicals, Tim's systolic blood pressure (the top number) was usually in the 130s and his diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) in the 80s, said his wife Debra. A year ago, that wasn't considered high.</p> <p>Now it is.</p> <p>Last November, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued new guidelines that redefined Tim's readings as stage 1 hypertension, recommending lifestyle changes and possibly medication. The old threshold for high blood pressure was 140/90.</p> <p>Before then, Tim's numbers were considered prehypertension, to be monitored but not usually treated with medication. But the new guidelines immediately reclassified about 31 million Americans as having hypertension.</p> <p>\"I wish Tim and I had thought to ask our health care providers about this over the years,\" said Debra, a freelance writer whose husband was the business editor of <i>The State Journal-Register </i>in Springfield, Ill. \"I also wish we would have done our own research.\"</p> <p>High blood pressure (hypertension) is labeled a \"silent killer\" because it often has no symptoms. But untreated over time, it can lead to heart disease, stroke, vision loss, kidney failure and other serious complications.</p> <p>While a reading below 120/80 is still considered normal blood pressure, systolic readings of 120-129 are now considered elevated blood pressure.</p> <p>\"The benchmarks are changing,\" said Dr. Jackson Wright, director of the Clinical Hypertension Program at the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center and one of the guidelines' authors. \"The major issue now is what's going to be the best way to implement the new target where we have conclusive evidence that they are effective in reducing cardiovascular events.\"</p> <p>In the year since the guidelines were issued, he said, \"I think that overall they have had a very positive effect. But whenever there's something new, there are going to be questions, disagreements and pushback.\"</p> <p>Dr. Elliot Davidson, director of the Akron General Center for Family Medicine in Ohio, called the new guidelines \"useful,\" but said the adjustment will take time.</p> <p>\"We're probably starting some people on medication that we would have just watched before, or we're getting them back in the office a little sooner to check their pressure,\" said Davidson, who was not involved in writing the ACC-AHA guidelines.</p> <p>But because other organizations also issue blood pressure guidelines, he said patients are probably experiencing some guideline fatigue. \"I think that makes it even more important to have a good relationship with a primary care physician who you can process this with,\" Davidson said.</p> <p>Just having these dialogues may be one of the most significant results of the new recommendations, said Sean Stocker, director of basic and translational research at the University of Pittsburgh Hypertension Center, who was not involved in the guidelines.</p> <p>\"This has revitalized the discussion around blood pressure control,\" he said. \"Whether it's new numbers or old numbers &hellip; we need to talk about not only what those numbers should be, but how do you actually diagnose this and then what do you do to treat it.\"</p> <p>According to federal statistics, about one in six people don't know they have high blood pressure, and only about half of people with hypertension have it under control -- and that's based on the old definition.</p> <p>Stocker said one of the most important recommendations of the new guidelines is the need to measure blood pressure more accurately, both by training doctors and technicians better and by calibrating monitors more frequently.</p> <p>As in many forms of cardiovascular disease, Stocker said, the key is awareness, and then prevention, through healthier lifestyles and, if necessary, medication.</p> <p>\"That's what the new guidelines are really suggesting,\" he said. \"Look at this sooner in your lifetime as numbers start to creep up before they get too high. And start taking actions a little bit earlier to make an impact not just on high blood pressure but other diseases.\"</p> <p>That has certainly been the impact on Debra Landis after tragically losing her husband.</p> <p>\"I'm keeping an eye on my blood pressure, getting more exercise and striving to lose weight,\" she said. \"My children and I made a promise to ourselves, because Tim would want us to do this.\"</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 27, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- An hour or less of weightlifting each week might significantly cut your risk of heart attack or stroke, new research suggests.</p><p>Evaluating nearly 12,600 adults over more than a decade, scientists found that small amounts of resistance exercise weekly were linked to between 40 percent and 70 percent fewer cardiovascular events.</p><p>But doing more weightlifting didn't reduce these risks further.</p><p>\"Strength training is not just to make yourself look good to be shirtless on the beach,\" said Dr. Alon Gitig, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai Riverside Medical Group in Yonkers, N.Y.</p><p>\"It has definite health benefits &hellip; and seems to directly impact on cardiovascular health,\" added Gitig, who wasn't involved in the study.</p><p>Weightlifting uses muscle resistance to strengthen and build muscles. Other types of resistance exercise include pushups, sit-ups or lunges.</p><p>Study author Duck-chul Lee said, \"Traditionally, weightlifting was for athletes, and that's why I think there is less evidence on its health benefits, specifically for the heart.\" Lee is an associate professor of kinesiology at Iowa State University. </p> <p>\"People know that running or cardio exercise is good for the cardiovascular system, but there are benefits of weightlifting on the heart that were not [previously] well-studied,\"  Lee added. </p><p>In research published separately, Lee and his colleagues found that less than an hour of weightlifting per week also reduced the risk for high cholesterol and metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions linked to diabetes. Those reports are in the journal <i>Mayo Clinic Proceedings</i>.</p><p>For the heart and stroke study, the researchers studied nearly 12,600 participants (average age 47) who had undergone at least two clinical examinations between 1987 and 2006. The participants self-reported their levels of resistance exercise, and follow-ups were done about five and 10 years later.</p><p>The results indicated that the benefits of resistance exercise on heart and stroke risk were independent of aerobic exercise such as walking or running, Lee said. </p><p>Compared with participants who did no resistance exercise, those who took part from one to three times and up to 59 minutes in all each week experienced a risk reduction of up to 70 percent.</p><p>The study didn't prove that weightlifting prevents heart attack or stroke, only that an association exists, however.</p><p>\"We found benefits of resistance exercise without body mass index [changes],\" Lee added. \"It means that even though you don't lose weight, you can still get benefits for the heart. People believe the benefits of exercise are from losing weight, but that's not true.\"</p><p>Gitig, however, expressed caution about the findings. He said the cardiovascular benefits \"seem to be a lot higher than we would expect from strength training.\"</p><p>In addition, Gitig noted that most participants were male and white, coming voluntarily to the clinic where the study was held. \"The question is if confounding variables made these people healthier to begin with,\" he said.  </p><p>Still, Gitig said he wasn't as surprised by learning about the cardiovascular benefits linked to weightlifting as he might have been five or 10 years ago.</p><p>He and Lee agreed that easing into a weightlifting routine should be safe for anyone who's healthy overall and doesn't have symptoms of cardiovascular or kidney disease. If you do, check with your doctor first, they said.</p><p>\"I would counsel my patients that [the research] is very eye-opening and suggests that strength exercise is definitely a good thing overall and may have more powerful benefits than previously thought,\" said Gitig, also an assistant professor of medicine at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.</p> <p>And what if you don't have access to free weights or weight-training machines? Digging in the yard and lugging heavy shopping bags provide strength-training benefits, too, Lee noted.</p><p>The study was published online recently in the journal <i>Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Harvard Health offers tips <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/7-tips-for-a-safe-and-successful-strength-training-program\" target=\"_new\"> for strength-training exercise</a>.</p>",

In focal epilepsy, seizures begin in one area of the brain. In generalized epilepsy, seizures affect both sides of the brain.</p><p>The scientists analyzed 114 pregnancies among 99 women with epilepsy and found that seizures increased during pregnancy among 53 percent of those with frontal lobe epilepsy, 22.6 percent of those with focal epilepsy and 5.5 percent of those with generalized epilepsy.</p><p>Compared to the time before pregnancy, seizures were more numerous nine months after giving birth among 20 percent of those with frontal lobe epilepsy, 7 percent of those with focal epilepsy, and 12 percent of those with generalized epilepsy.</p><p>The researchers also found that an increase in seizures tended to occur among women taking more than one epilepsy drug. They also found that for women with frontal lobe epilepsy, an increase in seizures was most likely to begin in the second trimester of pregnancy.</p><p>\"Frontal lobe epilepsy is known to be difficult to manage in general and often resistant to therapy, but it isn't clear why the seizures got worse among pregnant women because the level of medication in their blood was considered adequate,\" Voinescu said.</p><p>\"Until more research provides treatment guidance, doctors should carefully monitor their pregnant patients who have focal epilepsy, to see if their seizures increase despite adequate blood levels and then adjust their medication if necessary,\" she concluded.</p><p>The study was to be presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American Epilepsy Society, in New Orleans.

Her team was scheduled to present the new findings Thursday at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.</p><p>All things being equal, many women may now opt for radiation only and spare themselves lymphedema, said one U.S. oncologist.</p><p>\"If, in fact, the rate of recurrence in the breast or armpit is basically the same with radiation as compared to removal of lymph glands, this would make radiation very interesting as an alternative,\" said Dr. Lauren Cassell, who wasn't involved in the new study. She directs breast surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>The new research involved 1,425 women with early stage breast cancer that had spread to their armpit lymph nodes and was found by biopsy. Each patient was randomly assigned to have either surgery (744 women) or radiation therapy (681 women).</p><p>After 10 years, recurrence of cancer in the armpit lymph nodes had occurred in 1.82 percent (11 out 681 patients) of those who had received radiation therapy and 0.93 percent (7 out of 744 patients) of those who had undergone surgery.</p><p>Overall survival rates after 10 years were 81.4 percent for the radiation patients and 84.6 percent of those who'd had lymph nodes removed, Donker's team found.</p><p> Dr. Emiel Rutgers, a surgical oncologist at the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam, was the lead investigator of the new study. \"Patients with early stage invasive breast cancer who have no clinical evidence of local spread of disease to axillary (armpit) lymph nodes, meaning that palpation or ultrasound shows no sign of disease spread, undergo a sentinel lymph node biopsy,\" he explained in a meeting news release.</p><p>However,  \"data from another recent clinical trial suggested that there may be some patients who do not need axillary treatment even if they have a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy,\" Rutgers added.</p><p>The new study seems to reinforce that view, at least for some patients, he said.</p><p>\"Moving forward, we need to better tailor treatment for each individual patient. Some will still need axillary treatment, and our data indicate that axillary radiotherapy is a good option here,\" Rutgers concluded.</p><p>One other U.S. expert was encouraged by the new findings.</p><p>\"As breast surgeons, many of us have been excited about and eagerly anticipating the results,\" said Dr. Alice Police, regional director of breast surgery at Northwell Health Cancer Institute in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y.   </p><p>The notion that some patients can avoid lymph removal  \"is very appealing as a surgeon and as a human being,\" she said. Police noted that in recent years, removal of just one or two so-called \"sentinel\" lymph nodes has become routine. Surgeons use these sample nodes to assess if (and by how much) breast cancer may have spread, before deciding on whether to remove more nodes.</p><p>Already, the number of full lymph-removal surgeries has been reduced by using this sentinel node approach, she said.</p><p>And with the results of the new Dutch trial, \"we now know that even with one positive lymph node, more patients can have radiation therapy instead of more surgery,\" Police said.</p><p>\"Radiation therapy has fewer complications and is generally easier on patients,\" she said. \"This is wonderful news for breast cancer patients who can rest assured that radiation instead of more surgery will not increase their mortality rates or recurrence rates with only a small amount of [lymph node] disease. I am happy that for some patients we can make this an easier journey.\"</p><p>Because the new findings were presented at a medical meeting, they should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Cancer Society has more on <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-basics/lymph-nodes-and-cancer.html\" target=\"_new\">lymph nodes and cancer</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 6, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Although fewer Americans are dying from heart disease and cancer, deaths from chronic kidney disease are on the rise, especially among young adults, a new study finds. </p><p>\"Unfortunately, chronic kidney disease is known as a 'silent epidemic,' because many people don't realize they have it until the disease is at an advanced stage,\" said senior study author Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly. He's a nephrologist and an assistant professor of medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.</p><p>\"It is particularly concerning that chronic kidney disease is becoming more common in younger people. This is a remarkable move in the wrong direction,\" Al-Aly said in a university news release.</p><p>Deaths from cancer and cardiovascular disease have declined due to advances in treatment. But no major advances in the treatment of kidney disease have been seen during the past two decades, Al-Aly said. </p><p>Instead, chronic kidney disease has risen across the country in the past 15 years and among those aged 20 to 54 -- a group in which the condition used to be uncommon, the researchers noted. Overall, U.S. deaths from kidney disease increased 58 percent -- from about 52,100 in 2002 to 82,500 in 2016.</p><p>The researchers suspect that the increase is at least partially due to high-sugar, high-salt diets and the ongoing obesity epidemic. Unhealthy diets increase toxins that kidneys are designed to remove, which may account for the organs wearing out.</p><p>The increase in chronic kidney disease varies by state. For example, while all states saw rising rates, they are significantly higher in places with the highest obesity rates, including Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and West Virginia.</p><p>For the study, Al-Aly and his colleagues used the Global Burden of Disease database, which provides information about 350 diseases and injuries by age and gender, as well as more than 80 risk factors in the United States and other countries. For their study, the researchers focused on U.S. data by age from 2002 to 2016.</p><p>They found that the rates of chronic kidney disease are increasing faster than the rates of all noninfectious diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, cirrhosis, chronic lung diseases, mental problems and brain diseases. </p><p>Deaths from chronic kidney disease among younger adults are still rare, but they are increasing, the researchers found. For people aged 20 to 54, the probability of death from chronic kidney disease increased almost 27 percent, from 100 deaths per 100,000 people in 2002 to 125 deaths per 100,000 in 2016.</p><p>Among those aged 55 and older, chronic kidney disease deaths rose nearly 26 percent, from 1,950 deaths per 100,000 people in 2002 to 2,450 deaths per 100,000 in 2016.</p><p>\"Public health priorities, policy initiatives, funding allocation and advocacy efforts need to catch up to this reality that the burden of chronic kidney disease is rising, and the speed of change now outpaces other noncommunicable diseases,\" Al-Aly said. \"A concerted effort should be made to put the brakes on this.\"</p><p>The report was published online recently in the journal <i>JAMA Network Open</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Kidney Foundation has more on <a href=\"http://www.kidneyfund.org/kidney-disease/chronic-kidney-disease-ckd/\" target=\"_new\">chronic kidney disease</a>.</p>",

Previous studies have shown that 10 years of endocrine therapy reduces the odds for disease recurrence.</p><p>\"This study provides evidence in a large, racially diverse cohort study that black women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer experience unique barriers to endocrine therapy adherence,\" said study author Stephanie Wheeler, of the University of North Carolina School of Public Health.</p><p>This may lead to poorer outcomes, she added.</p><p>In the United States, even though black women are less likely to develop breast cancer than white women, they are 40 percent more likely to die from it, the researchers noted.</p><p>For the study, the researchers examined data on 1,280 women who said they were prescribed endocrine therapy. Almost half were black.</p><p>Overall, 24 percent of the black women reported not taking their endocrine therapy drugs as often as they should.

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Oct. 11, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- \"Sit-stand\" desks can get office workers on their feet more often -- and improve their well-being along the way, a new study suggests.</p><p>Researchers found that when they swapped out traditional office desks for sit-stand versions, workers stayed on their feet for an extra 80 minutes on the average workday.</p><p>And over one year, that translated into lower levels of anxiety and job fatigue, less back pain and more engagement in work.</p><p>The findings, published online Oct. 10 in the journal <i>BMJ</i>, may offer desk workers more incentive to get on their feet whenever possible.</p><p>\"Simply replacing some time spent sitting each day with standing may be beneficial in lots of different ways for health and well-being,\" said lead researcher Charlotte Edwardson, an associate professor at the University of Leicester, in England.</p><p>That doesn't mean better-designed desks are the sole key to a happy, healthy workplace, experts said.</p><p>Office workers are notoriously sedentary -- spending up to 85 percent of their workday in a chair, according to Edwardson's team.</p><p>And research suggests that all that sitting contributes to obesity, diabetes, heart disease and even a shorter lifespan.</p><p>In this trial, employees stood for longer periods after they were given sit-stand desks. But they didn't walk around more often, as the researchers hoped they would.</p><p>The desks, Edwardson explained, were part of a bigger educational effort that encouraged office workers to break up their day with standing and walking.</p><p>\"But it appears that participants chose to stand rather than move around,\" she said.</p><p>Still, sit-stand or standing desks can be one good step, said Dr. Esther Sternberg, director of the University of Arizona's Institute on Place, Wellbeing and Performance, in Tucson.</p><p>Sternberg -- who said she uses a standing desk -- conducts research on workplace design and employee health.</p><p>\"It used to be that the focus was on removing toxins from the workplace, which is absolutely necessary,\" Sternberg said.</p><p>But more recently, she explained, researchers have been studying the range of ways the \"built environment\" affects workers' well-being. That includes looking for ways to free desk workers from so much down time.</p><p>\"There's a saying that 'sitting is the new smoking,'\" Sternberg noted.</p><p>In a study published earlier this year, her team found that open-office designs might be healthier than cubicles or private offices: Employees in open workspaces were more physically active and less stressed than those who were walled off from each other.</p><p>However, Sternberg emphasized that that doesn't mean workers will thrive if employers \"just knock down some walls\" and dump desks and office equipment into one room.</p><p>\"Office spaces need to be thoughtfully designed,\" Sternberg said -- and there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" way of doing that, she added.</p><p>Factors ranging from the type of business to employees' individual personalities matter, too, according to Sternberg.</p><p>The new findings are based on 146 people with desk jobs within the U.K. health system. About half were randomly assigned to receive adjustable-height desks that allowed them to work sitting or standing.</p><p>A year later, the study found, those workers were standing for longer periods, versus their counterparts with traditional desks -- an average of 83 minutes more each day.</p><p>There were also signs that less sitting sparked a range of benefits. Workers with sit-stand desks gave higher ratings to their job performance and work engagement, and reported less anxiety and job fatigue.</p><p>They reported fewer aches and pains, too. For example, Edwardson said, workers with sit-stand desks were 84 percent less likely to complain of debilitating lower back pain.</p><p>For now, she suggested desk workers look for ways to get on their feet more often.</p><p>\"We're not saying, 'Don't sit down,'\" Edwardson noted. It's about finding a better \"balance,\" she said, between sitting and moving throughout the workday.</p><p>In an accompanying journal editorial, Dr. Cindy Gray, of the University of Glasgow in Scotland, questioned the potential for health gains by simply replacing sitting with standing at work. The reason: the sit-stand desks did not lead to more potentially beneficial physical activity. </p><p>The study was funded by government and university grants.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Cancer Society has tips on <a href=\" https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/tips-for-staying-active-at-work.html\" target=\"_new\">staying active at work</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Sept. 20, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The opioid epidemic has been front-page news for a few years now, with rising overdose deaths driving an overall decrease in Americans' average life expectancy.</p><p>But a new study suggests that the opioid epidemic is, in fact, nothing new.</p><p>Death rates from drug overdoses in the United States have been on an exponential growth curve that dates back at least to the early 1980s, researchers report.</p><p>\"We found the epidemic has been continually growing in a predictable pattern for almost four decades now,\" said senior study author Dr. Donald Burke, dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health.</p><p>\"The number of deaths increase every year by about 8 percent, and that continues,\" Burke said.</p><p>But this steady trend has been masked by the fluid nature of America's illicit drug culture, Burke and his colleagues found.</p><p>\"When we tried to look at this smooth continuous exponential growth, we found that the epidemic has been changing. The drugs change, the demographics of who's dying changes, the locations change,\" Burke said. \"You have this paradox of the overall curve is a smooth growth process, but it's composed of all these different sub-epidemics.\"</p><p>For this study, researchers collected nearly 600,000 individual reports of drug overdose deaths maintained by the U.S. National Vital Statistics System since 1979. That's the year drug overdoses began to be reported in their own category on death certificates, Burke explained.</p><p>During the past four decades, deaths from drug overdose plot as a near-perfect curve. Each year's total overdose count falls almost exactly on a smooth upward exponential curve, researchers said.</p><p>But looking closer at overdose death rates for individual drug types, which has been tracked since 1999, researchers found that what appeared to be a smooth and predictable trend was anything but.</p><p>Instead, drugs like cocaine and heroin and methamphetamine go in and out of vogue, year by year and decade by decade.</p><p>What is now known as the \"opioid epidemic\" actually started in the mid- to late-1990s, when doctors began overprescribing opioid painkillers, Burke said.</p><p>State and federal lawmakers responded by toughening restrictions on opioid prescribing. This drove people hooked on opioid painkillers to take up the cheaper option of heroin. Since then, users have migrated to even cheaper and deadlier synthetic opioids like fentanyl.</p><p>\"Particularly in the last seven or eight years, there has been a marked explosion in the number of heroin and fentanyl users,\" Burke said. Heroin also used to be confined mainly to metropolitan areas on either coast; now it's being used in small towns across the country.</p><p>The findings were published Sept. 20 in the journal <i>Science</i>.</p><p>The new study shows \"how attempts to reduce drug overdose deaths are severely undermined by our nation's failure to address addiction with effective, evidence-based prevention and treatment approaches,\" said Linda Richter, director of policy research and analysis with the Center on Addiction, a national nonprofit organization.</p><p>\"We typically focus our efforts -- most of which are underfunded and frequently not supported by scientific evidence -- on the scariest drug trend of the day, and we wait to respond until overdose deaths reach epidemic levels,\" Richter said. </p><p>\"We throw a variety of interventions at the problem and then don't bother to devote the time and resources necessary to assess whether those interventions even work,\" she said.</p><p>Why do overdose deaths continue to rise? Burke said it's likely a combination of \"push\" and \"pull\" factors on either side of the illicit drug market.</p><p>On the \"push\" side, Burke noted that innovation is on the side of drug suppliers.</p><p>\"Everything that is on the supply side helps make drugs more available,\" Burke said. \"The cost of producing the drugs is getting cheaper, the actual sales price is cheaper, the purities are increasing, the technologies for delivery, communication is easier -- and that applies not to any one drug, but to drugs across the board.\"</p><p>On the \"pull\" side, American society seems to be evolving in ways that could promote drug use.</p><p>\"There's widening economic disparity, with many people having lost a sense of purpose in daily life,\" Burke said. \"There's been a dissolution of our sense of community, particularly in small towns.</p><p>\"It raises questions about what the future is going to hold,\" Burke said. \"The main issue we raise is, if we don't address these deeper social determinants, are we really going to be able to change the trajectory of the epidemic?\"</p><p>Richter agreed that a renewed focus on prevention is needed to block this ever-rising tide.</p><p>\"A smarter, more effective approach would be to implement a comprehensive, sustained and evidence-based approach to addiction prevention, early intervention and treatment that we invest in for the long-term,\" Richter said. \"This approach would involve broad-based prevention that addresses all addictive substances and the reasons people use them, as well as significant changes in how addiction treatment is delivered in the United States.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse has more about the <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids/opioid-overdose-crisis\" target=\"_new\">opioid overdose crisis</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY,  Oct. 1, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- If your weight, blood pressure, cholesterol or blood sugar levels fluctuate, you may have a higher risk of heart attack, stroke and premature death than people with more steady readings, new research suggests.</p><p>According to the study, during nearly six years of follow-up, men and women whose readings changed the most were 127 percent more likely to die, 43 percent more likely to have a heart attack and 41 percent more likely to have a stroke, compared with those whose readings remained stable.</p><p>\"Variability in metabolic parameters may have a role in predicting mortality and cardiovascular outcomes,\" said lead study author Dr. Seung-Hwan Lee, a professor of endocrinology at the College of Medicine at Catholic University of Korea in Seoul.</p><p>Because the study looked at data from the past, however, it can only show an association between variability in these readings and risk. It can't prove that variability is the cause of the heightened risk of heart attack, stroke or death, the study authors cautioned.</p><p>The researchers also didn't look at the reasons why the metabolic readings might fluctuate over time.</p><p>Treatment strategies to reduce fluctuations in these parameters, however, should be a goal to prevent bad health outcomes, Lee said.</p><p>These strategies might include keeping blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar within normal ranges -- not too high or too low -- and maintaining a normal weight -- not too fat or too thin.</p><p>Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, found these findings interesting.</p><p>\"This opens up a new avenue for accounting for variation in risk factors over time in estimating risk for cardiovascular disease,\" he said. \"Better identification of those at higher and lower risk may translate to better use of prevention strategies and therapies.\"</p><p>But further studies are needed to determine if treatment strategies that specifically reduce fluctuations in these parameters will reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and improve health, Fonarow said.</p><p>For the study, Lee and colleagues used the Korean National Health Insurance system to collect data on more than 6.7 million people who had not had heart attacks, diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol. </p><p>Between 2005 and 2012, all participants had at least three exams that documented weight, blood sugar,  blood pressure and cholesterol.</p><p>The researchers specifically looked at the effect of changes in participants whose readings went up or down more than 5 percent. Whether people's readings got better or worse didn't matter -- high variability by itself was linked to an increased  risk of death during the study period, the findings showed.</p><p>Women and older adults were more likely to have highly variable parameters, the researchers said. </p><p>Lee said because the study was done in Korea, it's not certain that these findings would apply to the United States. Other studies in different populations, however, indicate that the link between fluctuating readings and the risk of dying are common.</p><p>One specialist offered a note of caution to people who are obese or overweight not to misinterpret these findings.</p><p>\"This is provocative research that raises questions about binge dieting,\" said Dr. Byron Lee, director of electrophysiology laboratories and clinics at the University of California, San Francisco. </p><p>But it is far from definitive, he added. \"Hopefully, obese patients don't use this as an excuse to stop trying to lose weight,\" Lee said.</p><p>The report was published online Oct. 1 in the journal <i>Circulation</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/life-after-a-heart-attack/lifestyle-changes-for-heart-attack-prevention\" target=\"_new\"> American Heart Association</a> for more on heart attack prevention.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 10, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Hurricane Michael, now a powerful category 4  storm, is expected to make landfall in northern Florida Wednesday.</p><p>And as with every such storm, power outages will occur, along with the risk of deadly carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning from gas-powered generators.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, poison control centers continue to see surges in generator-associated carbon monoxide poisonings during and after major storms, despite mandated warning labels and public health advisories,\" said Dr. Fred Henretig, who outlined the danger in an editorial in the October issue of the <i>American Journal of Public Health</i>.</p><p>Henretig is an emergency medicine physician and toxicologist at the Poison Control Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.</p><p>\"In many instances of CO poisoning, tragedies result -- whole families are poisoned, some fatally,\" he added in a hospital news release.</p><p>That's because CO is a silent killer -- an odorless, tasteless, colorless gas produced by appliances that burn combustible fuels such as wood, oil, gas, propane, kerosene or coal. If an appliance malfunctions or is poorly vented, fumes can build up, putting people at risk. </p><p>Early symptoms of CO poisoning are often mistaken for the flu, and include headache, nausea, sleepiness, dizziness and confusion. Continued exposure can lead to coma, heart attack and death.</p><p>You should suspect CO poisoning if symptoms occur shortly after using a furnace or generator, if multiple family members get sick at the same time, or if symptoms improve outdoors.</p><p>\"At toxic levels, CO is a frequent cause of poisoning morbidity and death in the U.S., resulting in more than 50,000 emergency room visits each year,\" Henretig said.</p><p>To protect your family from CO poisoning, make sure furnaces, chimneys, wood stoves and heaters are checked regularly and are in good condition, he advised.</p><p>During power outages, gasoline-powered generators should only be used outdoors, away from vents or windows, and at least 25 feet from the house, he said. </p><p>Carbon monoxide can pose a hazard at other times, too. To curb the danger year-round, Henretig offered up the following advice:</p><ul><li>Never use gas ovens to heat your home.</li><li>Don't use barbecue grills or gasoline-powered equipment indoors or in a garage. </li><li>Don't sit in a car with the engine running if the exhaust pipe is blocked by mud or deep snow. </li><li>Install CO monitors in your home and make sure they have fresh, working batteries.</li></ul><p>If you think there is carbon monoxide in your home, open doors and windows to air it out, turn off the heating system, and call 911 or your heating company. If you suspect CO poisoning, leave the area immediately and contact the Poison Control Center or 911, Henretig said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/Features/COpoisoning/\" target=\"_new\">CO poisoning prevention</a>.</p>",
