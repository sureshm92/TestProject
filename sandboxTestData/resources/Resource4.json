      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Oct. 19, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Though the maker of Juul e-cigarettes has claimed its product is aimed at adult smokers trying to quit, almost a quarter of the company's Twitter followers are under 18, a new study finds.</p><p>And many of these young fans are retweeting the company's messages, investigators added.</p><p>The findings are cause for worry, the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine researchers said.</p><p>\"Juul representatives have said the company is not trying to target adolescents with their advertising or sales, but our research clearly indicates that a sizable proportion of their Twitter audience is exactly this population,\" said study author Kar-Hai Chu. He's an assistant professor of medicine at Pitt's Center for Research on Media, Technology and Health.</p><p>\"This is highly concerning because adolescents exposed to e-cigarette marketing are more likely to use e-cigarettes and, in turn, young adults who use e-cigarettes are four times as likely as their non-vaping peers to transition to smoking traditional tobacco cigarettes,\" Chu explained in a university news release.</p><p>But Ted Kwong, a Juul spokesman, said the company works hard to aim its messages at adults.</p><p>\"We have taken numerous actions to prevent and combat underage use, including focusing our website and social media exclusively on the adult smoker community and removing all product-related content from our social media accounts,\" he said.</p><p>\"Since 99.7 percent of JuuL mentions on Twitter are generated by other users, we have also aggressively worked with social media platforms to remove posts and accounts that portray our product in unauthorized and youth-oriented manners,\" Kwong added.</p><p>It's believed that teens are more susceptible to nicotine addiction than adults. Nine out of every 10 cigarette smokers started before age 18, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Juul e-cigarettes resemble a flash drive and can be plugged into a computer to recharge. Juul vapor contains about double the concentration of nicotine found in other e-cigarettes and comes in flavors appealing to youngsters, such as mango and fruit medley, the researchers said.</p><p>The study looked at 3,239 tweets from Juul's official Twitter account between February 2017 and January 2018. The tweets were retweeted 1,124 times by 721 Twitter users.</p><p>The users' profiles were examined to determine if they were younger than 18. If the user didn't reveal an age, certain clues were used to find out if that person was a minor, such as a mention of their grade in school or an age-specific event.</p><p>If there was any doubt, the user was classified as an adult.</p><p>Along with concluding that at least 25 percent of Juul's Twitter followers are minors, the researchers also found that some of the Juul tweets were retweeted in a chain that extended through four Twitter users.</p><p>When someone retweets, the original tweet is shared with all of that person's followers, even if none of them follows the source of the original tweet, the researchers explained.</p><p>\"When this happens, the people seeing the retweet are getting it from a person, not a brand. It adds a level of normalization and buffers the viewers from the impersonal element of advertising, particularly if the person who retweeted it is a trusted friend or someone they aspire to be like,\" Chu said.</p><p>The same type of analyses used in this study could be used by public health agencies to identify teen Twitter networks promoting e-cigarette use and target them with counter-messaging, Chu suggested.</p><p>But Kwong reiterated that Juul products are only for use by adults.</p><p>\"We cannot be more emphatic on this point: no minor or nonsmoker/vaper should ever use Juul products,\" he said. \"Underage use is directly opposed to our mission of eliminating combustible cigarettes by offering the world's one billion existing adult smokers a true alternative.\"</p><p>The study was published Oct. 19 in the <i>Journal of Adolescent Health</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse has more about <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/electronic-cigarettes-e-cigarettes\" target=\"_new\">e-cigarettes</a>.</p>",

Note that you'll also see the term telemedicine, which usually refers to virtual visits with a doctor. Telehealth is broader and includes care from other types of health professionals, such as nurses.</p> <p>During \"visits\" you video chat with a health-care professional through your smartphone, tablet or computer, sometimes with no waiting time. And it all happens in real time.</p><p>Telehealth services vary from getting a diagnosis and a prescription, if needed, for minor medical issues, to ongoing monitoring of chronic conditions -- especially helpful to older Americans. As an example, your heart rate or blood sugar levels can be sent remotely to your doctor's office and he or she can review them with you while you have your virtual visit.</p><p>One study found that the most common virtual visits were for acute respiratory problems, urinary tract infections and skin complaints. In fact, telehealth can be very helpful in dermatology, a specialty that's short on doctors.</p><p>Telehealth for mental health care is another growing area. Video sessions can help people stick with their treatment plan if getting to a therapist's office is difficult. And it can be just as effective as face-to-face appointments.</p><p>Some health insurance providers now offer telehealth as an option in some of their plans. There's usually a fee for a telehealth visit, but it can be lower than your in-office co-pay. If you're on a high-deductible plan, the cost will certainly be less than you'd pay out-of-pocket for an office visit.</p><p>The Veterans Administration is just one of many government agencies that offers a variety of telehealth services.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The National Conference of State Legislatures has state-by-state information on <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-coverage-for-telehealth-services.aspx\" target=\"_new\">telehealth</a> services in your area.</p>",

Thirteen of those cases were severe enough to require hospitalization and one patient developed kidney failure, although no deaths have so far been reported.</p><p>The latest case of reported illness onset occurred Oct. 31. States affected by the outbreak include California (10 cases), Connecticut (1 case), Illinois (2 cases), Massachusetts (2 cases), Maryland (1 case), Michigan (7 cases), New Hampshire (2 cases), New Jersey (3 cases), New York (2 cases), Ohio (1 case) and Wisconsin (1 case).</p><p>The FDA noted that romaine lettuce typically has a shelf life of about 21 days, so contaminated produce could still be on store shelves or in people's refrigerators. For that reason, \"consumers throughout the U.S. shouldnot eatromaine lettuce until further notice,\" the agency advised.</p><p>The exact source of the outbreak remains unclear, but tests are being done on romaine lettuce throughout the U.S. market.</p><p>The strain of E. coli O157:H7 that's causing illness in the current outbreak \"is different than the one identified in the large outbreak in Spring 2018 linked to romaine from the Yuma growing region,\" the FDA said. However, \"it does appear to be similar to the strain that caused a smaller outbreak linked to leafy greens that occurred in the fall of 2017 in both the U.S. and Canada,\" the news release stated.</p><p>\"The quick and aggressive steps we're taking today are aimed at making sure we get ahead of this emerging outbreak, to reduce risk to consumers, and to help people protect themselves and their families from this foodborne illness outbreak,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in the press release. \"This is especially important ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, when people will be sitting down for family meals.\"</p><p>He said that, right now, there's just not enough evidence to request a recall from specific lettuce supplier, so in the meantime consumers should just avoid the product altogether.</p><p>If you feel you might be ill with E. coli, seek medical help. Symptoms often include severe stomach cramps, diarrhea (often bloody), and vomiting.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Find out more about E. coli illness at the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/ecoli-symptoms.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

Low energy translates to less self-control and a greater chance of aggression.</p><p>The good news: A study published in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i> found that a steady blood glucose level can translate into fewer fights with your spouse.</p><p>People in general have a harder time controlling anger than other emotions. It takes self-control to keep it reined in, but that's not something we have in unlimited amounts.</p><p>In fact, once you start drawing on your daily store of self-control, it quickly becomes depleted. So if you use it to keep from arguing with a co-worker or even to stop yourself from eating a donut in the breakroom, you'll have less of it by the time you get home.</p><p>Complicating the picture is that exerting self-control itself takes energy. So if your blood sugar is down because you haven't eaten in hours or didn't eat enough, self-control becomes even harder to draw on -- you just won't have the energy to cope with or even focus on the situation at hand. That's the reason dieting in particular can make people cranky. We also tend to take out frustrations on those closest to us, like our spouse.</p><p>Understanding why there are times when it's hard <i>not</i> to snap at your partner can help you know when to \"bite your tongue\" and resist engaging in an argument. The answer can be as simple as grabbing a snack or, even better, having a relaxing dinner together to put you in a happy mood for the evening ahead.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>You can read the entire <i>PNAS</i> study on <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/17/6254.full\" target=\"_new\">low blood sugar and bickering</a> online.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Oct. 22, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Childhood obesity has been linked to a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and early heart disease, but new research now ties it to a sometimes crippling hip condition.</p><p>It's called slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), and it causes the hip to become deformed, occasionally so much so that the hip collapses. SCFE causes pain and may result in lifelong disability, British researchers said. </p><p>\"Children with severe obesity at 5 years old had almost 20 times the risk of developing the severe hip deformity than a thin child,\" said study author Dr. Daniel Perry, a senior clinical lecturer in orthopedic surgery at the University of Liverpool.</p><p>The heavier a child was, the greater the risk of the hip condition, Perry said.</p><p>SCFE happens when the epiphysis -- the head of the thighbone -- slips from the bone at the growth plate, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Growth plates are weaker areas of bone that aren't fully developed yet. </p><p>So how does excess weight cause this problem?</p><p>\"The belief is that this is a mechanical failure,\" Perry said. \"Quite simply, the support structures around the growth plate in the hip can't withstand the weight of the child. The growth plate therefore slips out of place -- sometimes this is a sudden process, or sometimes this occurs very gradually.\" </p><p>Dr. Matthew Hepinstall, associate director of the Center for Joint Preservation and Reconstruction at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said SCFE is most common in preteens and young teens.</p><p>\"It seems to happen most often during growth spurts, when growth plates are wider, and therefore weaker. If not diagnosed early and stabilized with surgery, the parts of the thighbone on either side of the growth plate shift,\" he explained.</p><p>Hepinstall added that while this injury may heal, the bone develops with an abnormal shape that may cause hip problems into adulthood. </p><p>He said the problem is more common in heavier children because \"weight places more stress on the growth plate.\" </p><p>Perry said the condition should always be treated surgically to stabilize the hip. If the problem is diagnosed early, surgery is minor. </p><p>If it isn't diagnosed until the hip is severely displaced, \"then the child may have to undergo high-risk surgery to reconstruct the hip. Despite [our] best efforts, the hip bone often dies as the blood supply that feeds the hip gets injured, either by the disease or by the reconstructive surgery,\" he said.</p><p>When the hipbone dies, a hip replacement may be the only alternative. \"This is a huge undertaking in a youngster, with many repeat surgeries expected to be necessary throughout their life,\" Perry explained. </p><p>In the study, the researchers looked at health information on nearly 600,000 Scottish children from two different studies. One study included 5-and 6-year-old children born from 1970 onward. The other study began in 1995.</p><p>All of the children had height and weight measurements taken when they started elementary school and then again when they were 11 to 12 years old. </p><p>Seventy-five percent of the youngsters who were obese at 5 or 6 were still obese when they were 11 or 12, the study found.</p><p>Kids who were severely obese at 5 or 6 had almost six times the risk of SCFE compared to their normal-weight peers. Those who were severely obese at 11 or 12 had 17 times the risk of the hip condition. And the more weight a child put on, the greater the risk of SCFE. </p><p>\"We are very apprehensive that there will be an explosion in this hip disease if childhood obesity continues to rise,\" Perry said. </p><p>He said it's important that parents realize children won't just outgrow obesity. Significant lifestyle changes are needed. </p><p>But given the rise in childhood obesity, Perry also noted that physicians who care for children need to be aware of this condition. </p><p>\"Hip pain -- and knee pain, as the hip and the knee share sensory [feeling] nerves -- in adolescents, and especially obese adolescents, may mean the child has a SCFE,\" Perry said. Children with hip pain need to be examined on an urgent basis, as well as have X-rays to identify the deformity. </p><p>The findings were published online Oct. 22 in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons has more details on <a href=\"https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe\" target=\"_new\"> slipped capital femoral epiphysis</a>.</p>",

He is director of the mood and anxiety disorders program at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in New York City.</p><p>Ezogabine was approved in 2011 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an anti-seizure medication. Shortly after its approval, concerns were raised about the drug's effect on the retina and the possibility of it causing blindness.</p><p>The FDA ordered the drug's maker, GlaxoSmithKline, to do further safety studies. After reviewing those studies, the FDA ruled in 2015 that the drug did not appear to affect vision. Still, the company withdrew ezogabine from the U.S. market in 2017, citing poor sales.</p><p>Even so, psychiatrists noted that if the drug proves effective against depression in larger studies, other drugs that target this area of the brain could be developed.</p><p>Some 15 million Americans suffer from major depressive disorder, which is a leading cause of disability. Treatments include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such a Prozac and Paxil, but they are not effective across the board, the researchers noted.</p><p>It may be that depression is not one disease, but several that affect different areas of the brain, Murrough said.</p><p>That's why new approaches are needed to increase the number of drugs available that target different areas of the brain where depression arises and help patients cope with depression's various forms, he said.</p><p>\"Ongoing research is trying to find new ways to treat depression based on understanding what's going on in the brain when someone gets depressed and how can we reverse that,\" Murrough said.</p><p>Ezogabine works by increasing the activity of the area in the brain that controls potassium. Murrough explained animal studies have shown that depression can reduce the activity of this potassium channel and that ezogabine can increase its activity, thus relieving depression.</p><p>To see if the drug could work in humans, Murrough and his colleagues treated 18 people suffering from major depression with daily doses of ezogabine for 10 weeks.</p><p>MRI scans of the participants found that the drug activated the brain's so-called reward system, which resulted in a significant reduction of depressive symptoms.</p><p>Not all patients responded to the drug, which might mean that their condition has a different cause, Murrough said.</p><p>The researchers said they are currently conducting a larger trial that will compare ezogabine with a placebo, to get a better idea of how effective the drug is at treating depression. </p><p>The report was published online Nov. 1 in the journal <i>Molecular Psychiatry</i>.</p><p> Dr. Victor Fornari is a psychiatrist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He said, \"We need to find newer ways to treat depression,\" and ezogabine might be one of these new approaches.</p><p>\"This study doesn't change treatment -- yet,\" he added. \"At least this is preliminary evidence that this potassium channel target might be another avenue for treatment.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression/index.shtml\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institute of Mental Health</a> for more on depression.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Oct. 23, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- If you suffer from knee arthritis and worry that walking will only worsen your damaged joint, a new study suggests you put your fears aside, slip on some sneakers, and take a brief but brisk walk.</p><p>The researchers estimated that if older adults with the condition added just 5 minutes of brisk walking to their day, their odds of needing knee replacement surgery could dip by 16 percent.</p><p>On the other hand, light walking -- akin to a \"stroll\" -- may have no impact, said lead researcher Hiral Master, a Ph.D. candidate in biomechanics and movement sciences at the University of Delaware.</p><p>Her team reached those conclusions by digging into data from over 1,800 older adults with knee arthritis who wore portable devices that tracked their walking intensities for at least four days.</p><p>Over the next five years, 6 percent of the  participants had total knee replacement surgery.</p><p>The researchers used the data on people's walking habits to examine the effects of replacing \"non-walking\" time with time spent walking at different intensities. The findings showed that substituting just 5 minutes of down time with moderate-to-high intensity walking was linked to a 16 percent decline in the odds of needing knee replacement surgery.</p><p>The study authors defined \"moderate-to-high\" intensity as more than 100 steps per minute. In laymen's terms, Master said, that's a \"brisk\" walk that gets your heart rate up -- not a stroll around the block.</p><p>The findings were presented Saturday at the American College of Rheumatology's annual meeting, in Chicago. Such research should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>Knee osteoarthritis develops when the cartilage cushioning the joint gradually breaks down, which can eventually result in bone scraping on bone.</p><p>The condition is common among middle-aged and older Americans. According to the Arthritis Foundation, up to 13.5 percent of men and 19 percent of women aged 45 and older have knee arthritis that's severe enough to cause pain and other symptoms.</p><p>And those patients often wonder whether walking is good or bad for their arthritic joints, said Dr. Paul Sufka, a rheumatologist at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis.</p><p>\"They often ask whether they should minimize their activity, keep doing what they're doing, or intensify,\" said Sufka, who is also with the American College of Rheumatology's communications committee.</p><p>\"The general advice we give to patients is to stay active,\" Sufka said. But, he added, the truth is  there is too little evidence to give patients definitive recommendations.</p><p>The new findings do not prove that brisk walking directly lowers the risk of needing knee replacement surgery, Sufka noted.</p><p>But,  \"this gives us some useful information to bring to the discussion,\" he added.</p><p>Overall, Sufka said, research does suggest it's better for people with knee arthritis to be active rather than sedentary. And that's not just for the sake of their knees. Physical activity has a range of health benefits, including lower risks of heart attack and stroke.</p><p>Master agreed, and pointed out that exercise can help arthritis patients' mental well-being, as well as physical.</p><p>And it doesn't take a huge lifestyle change, she explained. The new findings suggest people can benefit from adding a short, brisk walk to their day.</p><p>In fact, Sufka said, such incremental shifts may be best.</p><p>\"The best exercise program is the one you can actually stick with,\" he said. \"If right now, you're walking around the block every day, what would be 5 percent or 10 percent more than that? You can gradually build from where you are.\"</p><p>And what if walking is painful? That's a tricky question, Sufka acknowledged. Some patients might benefit from physical therapy rather than only exercising on their own, he said.</p><p>Beyond aerobic exercise like walking, strengthening exercises for the leg muscles supporting the knees can also be helpful, he suggested.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Arthritis Foundation has an overview on <a href=\"https://www.arthritis.org/about-arthritis/where-it-hurts/knee-pain/\" target=\"_new\">knee arthritis</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 9, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The &#35;MeToo movement has given many Americans a glimpse into an unfamiliar world that may have left many wondering, \"What were they thinking?\"</p><p>It turns out they might not have been thinking much at all. New research suggests that almost 9 percent of people in the United States have distress caused by difficulty controlling their sexual feelings, urges and behaviors.</p><p>But the gap between genders was very small: Just over 10 percent of men showed compulsive sexual behavior, compared to 7 percent of women. </p><p>\"Historically, it's been thought that compulsive sexual behaviors affect mostly men. But women are showing that they are experiencing difficulty controlling sexual urges and behavior, too,\" said study author Janna Dickenson. She is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis.</p><p> Dickenson explained that such behaviors can vary widely. \"Some people might masturbate excessively so that it interferes with the ability to work, or someone might be paying for sex so much that it's damaging financially,\" she explained, adding that sexual behaviors become a problem when they influence your life in a way that's destructive.</p><p>So, does that mean people like Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein should be excused for aberrant and potentially criminal behavior?</p><p>\"When anyone faces a problem and there's a classification for that problem, it doesn't mean that it excuses that behavior. [In these cases], there's this link between hypersexuality and non-consent, but these are two separate issues that can be hard to tease apart,\" Dickenson explained.</p><p>Michael Klein, a psychologist at Gracie Square Hospital in New York City, said it's difficult to comment on individual cases, but \"it's possible that these high-profile cases reflect examples of compulsive sexual behavior. However, it may also be better explained by something else, such as taking advantage of a power dynamic, in the context of another [psychological] condition, or any combination of factors.\"</p><p>Mental health professionals have long debated whether or not sexual addiction is an actual addiction or an impulse disorder. What is common to problematic sexual behavior, no matter how it is classified, is substantial difficulty controlling sexual feelings, urges and behaviors to the point that it causes distress and impairment. </p><p>Distress and impairment includes neglecting social activities or personal health, repeatedly attempting to control sexual behavior unsuccessfully, and engaging in sexual behavior despite adverse consequences or minimal pleasure from his or her sexual activities, according to the researchers. </p><p>Using this definition, the study team asked more than 2,000 people to complete a screening test for compulsive sexual disorder. The study participants were already a part of a nationally representative study on sexual health and behavior. They were all between the ages of 18 and 50.</p><p>The researchers expected between 1 percent and 6 percent of the study group would meet the definition of compulsive sexual behavior disorder (CSBD). Instead, 8.6 percent of those screened were found to possibly have CSBD.</p><p>Dickenson said it's important to note that this study only used a screening tool. Someone who tests positive on this test should be referred for further evaluation. </p><p>Klein added that \"a large study such as this helps to increase our understanding of compulsive sexual behavior and related phenomena, as well as provide for future directions of study,\" but there are a lot of issues left to sort out. </p><p>\"There is a difference between feelings and actions, and thoughts and actions; having trouble controlling urges is not the same as acting on urges,\" he said. And cultural, social and religious norms and beliefs can impact how someone feels about sexual behavior. </p><p>Both experts said that if someone is concerned about their sexual behaviors, they should seek help. </p><p>\"People need to realize there is a wide spectrum of sexuality.  Thoughts and feelings are one thing, but behavior that you are unable to control is another matter.  If certain behaviors interfere with your life or cause distress for you or others, you may want to speak with a professional,\" Klein said.</p><p>The study was published online Nov. 9 in the journal <i>JAMA Network Open</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Read more about compulsive sexual behavior from the <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/oct03/compulsive.aspx\" target=\"_new\">American Psychological Association</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 14, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- People with celiac disease must follow a very restrictive diet, but an experimental vaccine may offer many of them the freedom to eat more normally. </p><p>Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder. If someone with the disease eats gluten -- a protein found in wheat, barley and rye -- it can damage the small intestine.</p><p>The vaccine, dubbed Nexvax2, is designed to elicit an immune system response in about 90 percent of people with celiac disease -- specifically those who carry a gene that allows their immune system to \"see\" the vaccine. </p><p>\"People with celiac disease often are afraid of food. Nexvax2 will give them freedom to be able to live life and not be afraid of eating out. It will be socially liberating,\" said Leslie Williams, CEO of ImmusanT, the company developing the vaccine. </p><p>Eating a gluten-free diet isn't easy, according to Alice Bast, CEO of Beyond Celiac, a nonprofit research organization. Cross contamination with foods containing gluten is always a concern, she explained. </p><p>\"Because people with celiac disease note that their toughest challenges are when dining out, socializing and traveling, an effective treatment could bring back some of the freedoms people in our community have lost,\" Bast said. </p><p>\"If [Nexvax2] is effective, it may one day be used to enable people with celiac disease to eat a normal diet that contains gluten without damaging their system or getting sick,\" she said. </p><p>About 1 percent of Americans have celiac disease. Symptoms include stomach pain and bloating, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, weight loss, fatigue, and delayed growth and puberty. Long-term problems can include malnutrition and nervous system problems. </p><p>The current treatment is avoiding gluten. But gluten is found in many foods and products such as lipstick. Even foods that don't directly contain gluten may be contaminated by gluten during the production process. Something as simple as a gluten-free chicken cutlet being fried in a pan previously used to cook a breaded (containing gluten) chicken cutlet may cause damage to someone with celiac disease, Bast explained. </p><p>Williams said that inadvertent gluten exposures like that occur an average of three to four times a month. </p><p>Nexvax2 works by reprogramming the T cells in the immune system that attack the small intestine in people with celiac disease. The injectable vaccine makes these cells nonresponsive to gluten exposure, Williams said. </p><p>The maintenance injections can be given at home with a device that automatically injects the vaccine under the skin. Williams said people would likely need to give themselves a shot once a week to protect themselves from inadvertent gluten exposures. </p><p>ImmusanT has completed five phase 1 trials of Nexvax2, Williams said. Early trials caused patients to vomit, so the initial vaccine dose was lowered. Then it's slowly increased until people are exposed to an amount of gluten that's about equivalent to two loaves of bread. </p><p>Williams said the vaccine was safe and well-tolerated in the early trials. Because it affects a specific part of the immune system, she said there aren't concerns about immune system suppression. </p><p>\"The vaccine targets only the part of the immune system that leads to celiac disease complications throughout the body. Unlike immunotherapy treatments for cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, Nexvax2 does not suppress the whole immune system,\" Bast said. </p><p>ImmusanT is planning a six-month phase 2 study on the vaccine. It will include 150 people with celiac disease from 40 sites in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, Williams noted. She said it's too soon to predict right now when the vaccine might potentially be available. It's also too soon to estimate the cost, she said. </p><p>Bast said that Nexvax2 isn't the only possible treatment for celiac disease in development. </p><p>\"There are more than a dozen therapies in the research pipeline. Nexvax2 is one of three therapeutic vaccines under investigation. Other approaches include preventing gluten from being absorbed by the body, breaking the gluten down using enzymes, and managing the body's reaction to gluten after it is absorbed,\" Bast said. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Celiac Disease Foundation offers more on <a href=\"https://celiac.org/about-celiac-disease/what-is-celiac-disease/\" target=\"_new\">celiac disease</a>.</p>",

USPSTF panels regularly convene to issue evidence-based guidance on a wide variety of medical matters. Their advisories help inform care and insurance coverage.</p><p>The benefits of taking PrEP far outweigh the risks, which can include kidney problems and nausea, the task force announced Tuesday.</p><p>PrEP -- perhaps best known as the two-drug combo pill Truvada (emtricitabine/tenofovir) -- is for use by people who do not have HIV but who are at high risk for getting it for various reasons.</p><p>For example, they may have a regular sex partner infected with HIV; have sex without a condom with a partner or partners whose HIV status is unknown; or share needles or other injection-drug equipment.</p><p>\"The evidence is clear: when taken as prescribed, PrEP is highly effective at preventing HIV,\" panel member Dr. Seth Landefeld said in a task force news release.</p><p>\"To make a difference in the lives of people at high risk for HIV, clinicians need to identify patients who would benefit and offer them PrEP,\" said Landefeld, chair of the department of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine.</p><p>Going forward, physicians should support patients taking PrEP to ensure they take the pill daily for maximum protection, the USPSTF said.</p><p>But while PrEP helps prevent HIV, it does not protect against other sexually transmitted infections, the panel noted. People who take PrEP should still use condoms and follow other safe sex measures to reduce the risk of other sexually transmitted infections.</p><p>In another draft recommendation, the task force reiterated that everyone ages 15 to 65 and all pregnant women should be screened for HIV as part of routine medical care. Younger adolescents and older adults at increased risk for HIV should also be screened.</p><p>\"About 40,000 people are diagnosed with HIV each year. This is why the task force, once again, calls for universal screening for HIV in adolescents and adults ages 15 to 65 years and in all pregnant women,\" task force member Dr. John Epling said in the news release. He is   professor and medical director of research, family and community medicine at Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine.</p><p>\"People deserve to know their HIV status so, if needed, they can start treatment early and live long, healthy lives,\" Epling added.</p><p>There are two ways to screen for HIV -- a conventional blood test sent to the laboratory for analysis, or a rapid test (finger prick or saliva swab) that provides results in less than 15 minutes.</p><p>While overall HIV infection rates in the United States have been going down, rates among some groups are on the rise, most notably among people ages 25 to 29.</p><p>The draft recommendations have been posted for public comment on the task force website and comments can be submitted now through Dec. 26, 2018.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/prep.html\" target=\"_new\">PrEP</a>.</p>",

A new study finds that if you get the wrinkle-relaxing shots today, you can speed up the effect by making faces.</p><p>Simple facial exercises can speed the wrinkle-smoothing effects of botulinum toxin (Botox), according to  researchers from Northwestern University in Chicago.</p><p>\"Patients often leave getting their Botox to the last minute,\" lead researcher and professor of dermatology Dr. Murad Alam said in a university news release.</p><p>\"If people get their botulinum toxin right before a social engagement or important work event, they may worry it won't start working in time,\" he added. \"Speeding up the effects could be important to people.\"</p><p>The new study included 22 adult women with forehead wrinkles who were treated with Botox. Half of them exercised their facial muscles for four hours after the injections, and the other half did not.</p><p>It was quite a workout for the face: Exercises included raised motions of the forehead and scowls in three sets of 40 repetitions, separated by 10 minutes.</p><p>Six months later, the women received another treatment and the two groups reversed doing exercises or no exercises.</p><p>Forehead wrinkles were rated as looking better within just two to three days after the treatment if the injections were followed by the facial exercises, compared with three to four days without the exercises.</p><p>\"Botox binds to receptors on nerve cells to relax muscles, and it is possible that exercise speeds this binding process,\" Alam explained. \"For patients who need quick results, the exercise may be worth the effort.

Surfing the internet.</p><p>These are activities taken for granted by most, but denied to paralyzed people who've lost the use of their arms and hands.</p><p>Now, thanks to a brain implant, a small group of paralyzed patients can directly operate an off-the-shelf tablet device just by thinking about it.</p><p>The implant reads their brain waves, allowing the participants to move a cursor on their tablet and perform mouse clicks, said lead researcher Dr. Paul Nuyujukian, an assistant professor of bioengineering and neurosurgery at Stanford University in California.</p><p>With their minds alone, the participants navigated commonly used tablet programs, messaged family and friends, looked up websites, checked the weather and shopped online.</p><p>One participant, a musician, even played a bit of Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\" on a digital piano interface.</p><p>\"The tablet became second nature to me, very intuitive,\" one of the participants said in the study. \"It felt more natural than the times I remember using a mouse.\"</p><p>Three paralyzed subjects had a 100-electrode implant placed into the motor regions of the brain, with a thin bundle of wires leading to a plug fixed to the skull, Nuyujukian said. The implant is about the size of a large pea, or a baby aspirin.</p><p>Two of the participants in this latest study had weakness or loss of movement of their arms and legs due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease), a progressive disease affecting the nerves in the brain and spine that control movement. The third participant was paralyzed due to a spinal cord injury.</p><p>The implant monitors brain patterns and feeds them into a computer algorithm, which decodes the thoughts and translates them into wireless signals, researchers said. Those signals are sent to the tablet, allowing subjects to control the device.</p><p>\"If you think back to the old one-button computer mouse of yesteryear, that's the signal we are able to extract from the brain,\" Nuyujukian said. \"It's the equivalent of a cursor velocity and a one-button click.\"</p><p>It usually takes about 5 to 10 minutes to calibrate the system to accurately translate a person's brain waves into cursor movements, Nuyujukian said.</p><p>\"The participant is instructed to imagine moving the cursor to the right or the left or up or down while the cursor is actually making that movement automatically,\" he said. \"It turns out that simply imagining making that movement is very similar to the patterns of neural activity that occur when one actually makes this movement.\"</p><p>Subjects are able to make up to 22 point-and-click selections per minute while using a variety of apps, and type up to 30 characters per minute using standard e-mail and text apps.</p><p>\"Participants can control these on day one. That is possible, and we have shown that,\" Nuyujukian said. \"That's not to say there is no benefit to practice. Our participants definitely feel more comfortable and capable with these systems after a week or two of actually practicing it.\"</p><p>The project is a collaboration that included researchers from Brown University, Massachusetts General Hospital and Stanford. The findings were published Nov. 21 in the journal <i>PLOS ONE</i>.</p><p>Last year, this same research group published a paper in which they were assessing the same patients' ability to type words using their thoughts, said Dr. Thomas Oxley, a clinical instructor and director of innovation strategy at Mount Sinai Hospital Health System's department of neurosurgery in New York City.</p><p>\"They've now gone beyond that to demonstrate that this system can e-mail, text message and surf the internet, amongst other things,\" said Oxley, who wasn't involved with the study. \"Those seem to be the three most-used applications in this group.\"</p><p>The researchers have further honed their system by integrating other useful \"smart\" computer technologies, Oxley said.</p> <p>For example, the paralyzed people's typing speed underwent a \"big jump primarily because they utilized predictive text, and it made a big difference in the patient's capacity to usefully utilize the system and interact with their social network,\" Oxley said.</p><p>This latest advance is the culmination of 15 years of research into brain patterns of movement, built on top of decades of previous neuroscience, Nuyujukian said.</p><p>The system could transform the lives of people with \"locked-in syndrome,\" whose paralysis has robbed them of the ability to speak, Oxley said.</p><p>\"That's so exciting for patients who've lost the capacity to speak, to be able to communicate with their loved ones again,\" Oxley said.</p><p>However, it will be years before the technology reaches the point where it becomes widely available, Nuyujukian said.</p><p>\"The final device needs to be something that's fully implantable, that needs to be miniaturized. It cannot be a giant stack of computers and a giant cart. That's not a clinical device,\" Nuyujukian said. \"It needs to be something that is just as accessible and easy to use as many of the other implantable technologies that we have for interacting with the brain, like deep brain stimulators or cochlear implants.</p><p>\"This isn't something that will be clinically available, say, next year,\" Nuyujukian noted.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation has more about <a href=\"https://www.christopherreeve.org/living-with-paralysis\" target=\"_new\">living with paralysis</a>.</p>",

This new finding could help explain health issues -- such as obesity and diabetes -- that often affect immigrants in the United States, the study authors said.</p><p>\"We found that immigrants begin losing their native microbes almost immediately after arriving in the U.S., and then acquire alien microbes that are more common in European-American people,\" said senior study author Dan Knights.</p><p>\"But the new microbes aren't enough to compensate for the loss of the native microbes, so we see a big overall loss of diversity,\" said Knights, a computer scientist and quantitative biologist at the University of Minnesota. </p><p>For the study, the researchers compared the gut bacteria population (\"microbiome\") of four groups: Hmong and Karen people living in Thailand; Hmong and Karen people who emigrated to the United States; the children of those immigrants; and white Americans (the \"control\" group).</p><p>The study was published Nov. 1 in the journal <i>Cell</i>.</p><p>The findings showed that the changes were greatest in immigrants' children.</p><p>\"We don't know for sure why this is happening.

But the new findings suggest that the antiplatelet drug, called ACT017, may be a safe and effective alternative to current therapies used in stroke patients.</p><p>\"Any way to minimize bleeding risk after administering antiplatelet agents is highly desirable,\" said one expert, Dr. Andrew Rogove. He directs stroke services at Northwell Health's Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y.</p><p>\"Further investigation of this promising drug in treatment of acute ischemic stroke is warranted and necessary,\" said Rogove, who wasn't involved in the new study.</p><p>This early, phase 1 trial of ACT017 was funded by the drug's maker, Acticor-Biotech. It included 36 healthy men and women, aged 22 to 65, who were divided into six groups.</p><p>Each group received intravenous infusions of the drug over six hours with doses ranging from 62.5 milligrams (mg) to 2,000 mg.</p><p>The drug did not significantly extend \"bleeding time\" -- a marker of increased risk for dangerous bleeds, said a team led by Dr. Martine Jandrot-Perrus, a scientist at France's National Institute of Health and Medical Research. </p><p>ACT017 was also well-tolerated at all doses, without serious side effects, her team reported, although a dose of 2,000 mg was most effective. The most common side effects were mild to moderate headache and head discomfort.</p><p>The findings were published April 18 in the journal <i>Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology</i>.</p><p>Jandrot-Perrus said there is a clear need for a drug to treat acute stroke that prevents clotting without increasing the risk of bleeding.</p><p>ACT017 inhibits blood platelet clumping and clot formation by targeting a protein in platelets that plays a critical role in clot formation, the researchers explained.</p><p>\"Our results are quite encouraging because they show the candidate compound is well-tolerated at doses even twice as high as the ones targeted for a future treatment and without any signs of bleeding,\" Jandrot-Perrus said in a journal news release. </p><p>She said the drug's action on platelets is fast, specific and largely reversible within 24 hours. </p><p>Another U.S. stroke expert agreed that doctors have long sought better, safer blood thinners.</p><p>\"The biggest impediment to removal of clots has always been the risk of bleeding that each treatment carries with it,\" said Dr. Salman Azhar, director of stroke care at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>Azhar explained that ACT017 seems to \"prevent formation of clots on the inner lining of the exposed blood vessel -- as is found in strokes and heart attacks -- without interfering with the ability of platelets to prevent bleeding elsewhere in the body if needed.\"</p><p>But he said more study -- in actual stroke patients -- is needed.</p><p>\"The caveat here is, of course, that this study was in normal volunteers without a clot and/or damaged brain tissue,\" Azhar said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Stroke Association has more on <a href=\"https://www.strokeassociation.org/en/life-after-stroke/preventing-another-stroke/anti-clotting-agents-explained\" target=\"_new\">anti-clotting drugs</a>.</p>",

Adenovirus Outbreak</b></span></p><p>An outbreak of adenovirus in New Jersey has resulted in the deaths of six children, health officials say.</p><p>Another 12 children at the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation in Haskell have been infected, according to a statement from the New Jersey Department of Health, <i>CNN</i> reported.</p><p>The center has been \"instructed not to admit any new patients until the outbreak ends and they are in full compliance,\" said the health department, which is investigating the outbreak.</p><p>Adenoviruses can cause mild to severe illness, but severe illness is less common. People at higher risk of severe illness include those with weakened immune systems or existing respiratory or cardiac disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <i>CNN</i> reported.</p><p>This outbreak \"is affecting medically fragile children with severely compromised immune systems. The strain has been particularly associated with disease in communal living arrangements and can be more severe,\" the health department said.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>120 Salmonella Cases in 22 States in Outbreak Linked to Ground Beef</b></span></p><p>The number of illnesses in a salmonella outbreak linked to recalled ground beef has risen to 120 people in 22 states, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.</p><p>Since the last update on Oct. 4, there have been 63 illnesses reported and six more states reported cases. The most recent illness began on Sept. 28. Thirty-three people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.</p><p>The CDC says consumers and retailers should not serve, sell or eat recalled ground beef produced by JBS Tolleson, Inc., of Arizona. The company recalled about 6.5 million pounds of beef products, including ground beef, that may be contaminated with salmonella.</p><p>The recalled meat was sold under many different brand names and many different stores. A complete list of stores and states where the recalled ground beef was sold is on the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service website.</p><p>In most cases, salmonella infection results in diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps 12 to 72 hours after eating contaminated food. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most people recover without treatment, according to the CDC.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Progress Against U.S. Opioid Crisis, HHS Secretary Says</b></span></p><p>There may be progress in the fight against U.S. drug overdose deaths, according to health secretary Alex Azar.</p><p>\"We are so far from the end of the epidemic, but we are perhaps, at the end of the beginning,\" Azar said Tuesday at a health care event sponsored by the Milken Institute think tank, the <i>Associated Press</i> reported.</p><p>He said that from late last year through early this year, the number of overdose deaths \"has begun to plateau,\" meaning that such deaths appear to be rising more slowly than before.</p><p>More than 70,000 people died of drug overdoses last year, according to preliminary data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this summer. That's 10 percent higher than in 2016.</p><p>Other preliminary figures released earlier this month by the CDC suggest that the rate of increase in overdose deaths between December 2017 and March 2018 slowed to 3 percent, compared with 10 percent over the previous 12 months, the <i>AP</i> reported.</p><p>In his speech, Azar suggested that a number of efforts are helping bring the overdose epidemic under control.</p><p>These include an increase in treatment with medications such as buprenorphine and naltrexone, much greater access to the overdose-reversing drug naloxone, and a decline in misuse of prescription opioids as doctors are being more careful in prescribing the painkillers, the <i>AP</i> reported.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Why Cancer Risk Is Higher in Taller Folk</b></span></p><p>Taller people are more likely than shorter people to develop cancer because they have more cells in their body in which cancer-causing mutations can occur, according to a new study.</p><p>Previous research has found that for every 10 centimeters (4-inches) of height within the typical range for people, there is a 10 percent higher risk of cancer, <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper in the U.K. reported.</p><p>A number of theories have been suggested to explain this, but this new study by Leonard Nunney, professor of biology at the University of California Riverside, suggests it just comes down to a person's size.</p><p>Tall people simply have more cells in which cancer can develop, according to the study in the journal <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</i>.</p><p>\"Whether that comes from a better diet or the fact that your parents happen to be tall doesn't matter  it is purely a number of cells, however that comes about,\" Nunney told <i>The Guardian</i>.</p><p>However, he noted that height differences don't fully explain why men are at higher risk for many cancers than women.</p><p>Taller people don't need to be concerned about their cancer risk, according to Georgina Hill, Cancer Research UK.</p><p>\"A number of studies over the years have shown that taller people seem to have a slightly higher risk of cancer,\" she told <i>The Guardian</i>. \"But the increased risk is small and there's plenty you can do to reduce the risk of developing cancer, such as not smoking and keeping a healthy weight.\"</p>",

It is to be presented Monday at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)  national conference, in Orlando, Fla.</p><p>\"Parents often leave young children on a bed or sofa, stepping away for a bit and thinking it's not dangerous,\" said study author Dr. Viachaslau Bradko.</p><p>\"But our research shows that these types of falls are now the most common source of injury in this age group,\" he added in an AAP news release. In fact, he said, children are 2.5 times more likely to be hurt by falls from beds and sofas than they are from stair-related injuries.</p><p>Bradko is a postdoctoral clinical research fellow with Texas Children's Hospital's Department of Orthopedic Surgery, in Houston.</p><p>About 62 percent of the children studied suffered \"soft furniture-related injuries\" injuries to the head and facial region. Severe or even life-threatening trauma was rare, but 2.7 percent of the children were hospitalized, the study found.</p><p>Children younger than 1 accounted for 28 percent of the injuries, and they were more than twice as likely to be hospitalized than children over age 1. Boys (56 percent of cases) were more likely to be injured than girls, the researchers said.</p><p>What's more, bed and sofa fall-related injuries among children under age 5 increased by more than 16 percent during the study period -- 2007 through 2016.</p><p>\"With falls from beds and sofas hurting such a large and growing number of infants, toddlers and young children, there's a serious need to step up prevention efforts,\" Bradko said.</p><p>Parents should always watch young children when they're on elevated surfaces, including soft furniture, and manufacturers need to improve safety design and consider warning labels, he suggested.</p><p>Those labels could advise against leaving young children unattended on beds without properly installed guard rails, or allowing children to jump on or off furniture above a certain height, he added.</p><p>Studies presented at medical meetings should be considered preliminary until they're published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Library of Medicine has more on <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/childsafety.html\" target=\"_new\">child safety</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 5, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- More than 3 million older Americans are now raising their grandchildren as their own, even as they struggle with health problems and financial stresses, a new survey shows.</p><p>Not only that, the children they take in are more likely to be troubled as they struggle to adjust to new lives, the researchers found.</p><p>Still, these grandparents seem to be handling the challenges as well as biological parents do.</p><p>\"Our study found that grandparents raising grandchildren -- despite having greater physical and mental health issues, and despite raising somewhat more behaviorally challenging children -- appear to be coping with the stresses of parenting just as well as biological/adoptive parent caregivers,\" said survey author Dr. Andrew Adesman. He is chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y.</p><p>That's not to say it's easy. Researchers found that grandparents who take on a late-in-life role of parenting tend to be in worse physical and mental health than actual parents. They are also more likely to be single and to struggle financially.</p><p>But responses offered in the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health by roughly 46,000 caregivers in grandparent- and parent-led households suggested that grandparents are no more overwhelmed by the burden of caregiving than parents are.</p><p>Why are more grandparents finding themselves having to make this tough choice?</p><p>\"The reasons for this are many, with fatal overdoses related to the opioid epidemic responsible for a significant proportion of these cases,\" Adesman said.</p><p> \"Child abuse or neglect is another frequent reason for children being placed with their grandparents,\" he noted. \"Other common reasons include mental health problems of one or both parents, or unexpected deaths due to health problems or motor vehicle accidents.\"</p><p>Adesman is to present his team's findings Monday at the American Academy of Pediatrics meeting, in Orlando, Fla. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>The survey enlisted nearly 45,000 parent-led households, of which about 5,000 were single parents. Grandparent-led families made up another 1,250 of those surveyed.</p><p>The researchers found that grandparent caregivers were more likely to care for black children and have a lower level of educational attainment. They were also more likely to say they had nobody to turn to for emotional support (31 percent of grandparents versus 24 percent of parents).</p><p>Children cared for by grandparents were more apt to lose their temper, argue, and/or become anxious or angry when confronted with change, according to the report.</p><p>But the researchers found no appreciable difference between grandparents and parents in terms of being bothered or angered by their child, and neither group suggested that caregiving was more difficult.</p><p>Amy Goyer, family and caregiving expert at AARP, observed that the roughly 5.7 million American children now being raised by grandparents are following a well-trodden path.</p><p>She noted, for example, that President George Washington and his wife Martha raised two of Martha's grandchildren.</p><p> Goyer also pointed out that, on average, first-time grandparents are in their late 40s, \"so it's important not to assume these grandparents are older than they are.\"</p><p>But Goyer, who is the former head of the AARP's Grandparenting Program, also said that \"the phenomenon of grandparents raising grandchildren has risen in recent decades, due to increased problems with substance abuse and addiction, incarceration, divorce and military deployment among other issues.\"</p><p>In that context, she suggested that the relatively positive findings are somewhat surprising, \"considering the extreme challenges so many grandparent caregivers face.\"</p><p> Goyer pointed out that \"this issue hits families in every socioeconomic level, but we know that grandparents with lower incomes struggle all the more with the extra costs. These children often have chronic health problems, mental illness. They have suffered trauma. They may be born addicted or suffer from attachment disorders. They tend to have more learning disabilities, and they may have more behavioral problems.\"</p><p>Still, grandparents have a leg up when it comes to experience, she added. \"They do this out of love. They do it because they want to keep their family together. They are motivated, and they are survivors,\" Goyer said.</p><p>The bottom-line is that \"children raised by relatives do better than those being raised in foster care,\" she said. \"There is the continuity of family. A child's identity is so closely tied to their family and being with grandparents helps continue that. The love from a grandparent is a special thing.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on grandparents as caregivers at <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/relationships/friends-family/info-08-2011/grandfamilies-guide-support.html\" target=\"_new\">AARP</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Dec. 19, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Car crashes and guns have been the two leading killers of kids in the United States for decades, and deaths from both causes are on the rise.</p><p>More children have been dying from motor vehicle crashes and firearms injuries since 2013, a new report shows.</p><p>Car crashes accounted for 20 percent of all deaths for children aged 19 and younger in 2016, while firearms accounted for 15 percent of these deaths, the researchers said.</p><p>By comparison, cancer was responsible for about 9 percent of childhood deaths that year, said lead researcher Dr. Rebecca Cunningham, director of the Injury Prevention Center at the University of Michigan.</p><p>\"I think most people don't realize firearms are killing substantially more children than cancer,\" Cunningham said. \"I think that's pretty new news to most Americans.\"</p><p>The recent uptick in deaths from cars and guns represents a reversal of all-time lows in 2013, according to the new report.</p><p>But while substantial progress has been made since 2000 in reducing the rate of child deaths caused by car crashes,  the rate of firearms deaths remains about where it was at the dawn of the century.</p><p>\"We've made tremendous strides in motor vehicle crashes, whereas with firearm injuries, we've made no progress at all,\" Cunningham said.</p><p>The rate of child deaths in motor vehicle crashes has been cut in half, from around 10 deaths per 100,000 children in 1999 down to 5.2 deaths per 100,000 in 2016, the findings showed.</p><p>\"We've had tremendous public health success for reducing motor vehicle crash deaths,\" Cunningham said. \"We've halved the rate in the past 17 years.\"</p><p>Crash deaths had been even lower, around 4.5 per 100,000 in 2013, but there's been a recent uptick, the investigators found.</p><p>Researchers aren't sure what's behind the recent increase in traffic crash deaths, but they think distracted driving and marijuana legalization might have contributed to it.</p><p>\"Before 2013, most teenagers didn't have cellphones while they were driving, probably,\" Cunningham said. \"There are some things that are different that need a lot more looking into.\"</p><p>There's also been an uptick in firearms deaths among children, but there's been much less progress made there.</p><p>Firearms deaths among children in 2016 occurred at a rate of about 4 per 100,000, up from 3.1 per 100,000 in 2013. That's a relative increase of 28 percent, the researchers noted.</p><p>But it's not much different from 1999, when the rate hovered just under 4.5 firearms deaths per 100,000 children, or the 2007 rate of 3.9 deaths per 100,000.</p><p>Between 2013 and 2016, gun-related homicides among children rose 32 percent, and gun-related suicides increased by 26 percent, according to the report.</p><p>\"We see more suicide in rural areas and more homicide in urban areas, but nonetheless, firearms are a safety problem for children across all neighborhoods. They're in everyone's back yard,\" Cunningham said.</p><p>The difference in progress can be chalked up to the interest, emphasis and money that the public has placed on motor vehicle deaths versus firearms deaths, she added.</p><p>\"We've invested a lot of money in traffic safety research. There's been a lot of investment in counseling families and teens around driving more safely. We've invested a lot in safer vehicles. We've invested a lot in safer roads. We've spent a lot of money on research to see which of those factors matter. We've invested as a country tremendously. We do not want these many people dying on the roads, and we've changed that,\" Cunningham said. </p><p>\"The message around firearm injury is we haven't invested at all. As a country, we've invested really not at all in firearm-related research, in doing any of the public health and injury prevention science we know could contribute to a decrease,\" she continued. </p><p>\"We've seen tremendous decreases in all other types of injury when we've applied research to them,\" Cunningham explained. \"We haven't done that with firearms, and because we haven't done that, we have pretty much a flat line, with the bump of the last couple of years even going in the wrong direction.\"</p><p>The report by Cunningham and her colleagues was published in the  Dec. 20 issue of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p>According to Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, the United States can halt these reversals through \"common sense and practical behaviors that can save our children's lives.\"</p><p>These include \"eliminating distractions, such as texting while driving, and getting more sleep to reduce driver fatigue and drowsiness,\" Glatter said. \"When it comes to gun safety, proper storage of guns along with novel biometrics to keep triggers locked could also be lifesaving.\"</p><p> Of the 20,360 deaths among U.S. children and teenagers that occurred in 2016, injuries caused more than 60 percent, Cunningham's team found.</p><p>Rural kids were most at risk with 33 deaths per 100,000, compared with 27 per 100,000 for suburban kids, and 23 per 100,000 for urban children, the study authors said.</p><p>That's mainly due to higher injury-related deaths in rural settings. For example, rural children and teens died 2.7 times more frequently in motor vehicle crashes. One factor in these deaths could be longer emergency medical service response times. </p><p>\"The bottom line is that we need to be proactive by focusing on research related to injury prevention, as opposed to being reactive once tragic events occur,\" Glatter said. \"We owe it to our children and future generations.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/safechild/index.html\" target=\"_new\">preventing childhood injuries</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 24, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Millions of Americans take angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to lower their blood pressure, but a new study suggests they might also increase their odds of developing lung cancer.</p><p>Among people taking these drugs for more than five years, the increased risk may be as high as 14 percent. Although that seems a small number, it could represent a large number of patients, the study authors noted.</p>  <p>\"The silver lining of our findings is that while we found an association, the risk at the individual patient level is likely low, even after 10 years of use,\" said lead researcher Laurent Azoulay, an associate professor of epidemiology and oncology at McGill University in Montreal.</p><p>\"For this reason, this should not deter patients from taking these drugs, should their physician deem the treatment appropriate,\" he said.</p><p>Azoulay also cautioned that this is an observational study, and it can't prove these drugs actually cause lung cancer.</p><p>Although ACE inhibitors are great for lowering blood pressure, they may also increase chemicals in the body that are linked with lung cancer, he explained.</p><p>Specifically, chemicals called bradykinin and substance P in the lung have been found in lung cancer tissue, and bradykinin may stimulate the growth of lung cancer.</p><p>Common ACE inhibitors include Lotensin (benazepril), Prinivil (lisinopril) and Altace (ramipril).</p><p>Deirdre Cronin Fenton, from the department of clinical epidemiology at Aarhus University in Denmark, said patients should weigh the benefits of these drugs against a small possible risk.</p><p>\"In an individual patient, any concerns about the risk of lung cancer should be balanced by the survival benefit associated with the use of ACE inhibitors,\" said Cronin Fenton, who wrote an editorial that accompanied the study.</p><p>Both were published Oct. 24 in the medical journal <i>BMJ</i>. </p><p>For the study, Azoulay and his colleagues collected data on nearly 1 million patients whose medical records were in a British database. These patients began taking drugs to control blood pressure between 1995 and 2015. </p><p>The participants were at least 18, with no history of cancer, and they were followed up for an average of six years. During that time, nearly 8,000 developed lung cancer. </p><p>After accounting for factors that might influence the findings, such as age, gender, weight, smoking, drinking and history of lung disease, Azoulay's team found that ACE inhibitors were tied to a 14 percent increased risk for lung cancer. </p><p>The risk for lung cancer was seen after five years of taking these drugs. For those who took them for more than 10 years, the risk increased to 31 percent, the researchers found. </p><p>A specialist not involved with the new study said patients taking ACE inhibitors should not worry because the benefits of these drugs far outweigh any risk for lung cancer. </p><p>\"ACE inhibitors have been extensively studied in a multitude of large-scale, randomized clinical trials in very diverse patient populations,\" said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. </p><p>In these trials, the benefits of ACE inhibitors have outweighed any potential risks, and many of these studies showed reductions in deaths without any evidence of an increased risk of cancer in general or lung cancer in particular, he said. </p><p>\"These findings should not raise concerns about the safety of ACE inhibitors,\" Fonarow said. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine for more on <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000087.htm\" target=\"_new\">ACE inhibitors</a>.</p>",

For these reasons, children are less likely to awaken and escape a nighttime home fire,\" Splaingard said in a hospital news release.</p><p>\"The fact that we were able to find a smoke alarm sound that reduces the amount of time it takes for many children 5 to 12 years of age to wake up and leave the bedroom could save lives,\" he added.</p><p>The study included 176 children, aged 5 to 12, who were exposed to different smoke alarms at a sleep research center. Three alarms used a child's mother's voice, while a fourth was the high-pitched type of alarm widely used in homes.</p><p>Compared to the tone alarm, a sleeping child was about three times more likely to be awakened by a mother's voice alarm.</p><p>A mother's voice alarm awakened 86 to 91 percent of the children and prompted 84 to 86 percent of them to escape from the bedroom, compared with rates of 53 percent and 51 percent, respectively, for the high-pitched alarm.</p><p>The median time to escape was 282 seconds (nearly 5 minutes) with the tone alarm, compared with 18 to 28 seconds with a mother's voice alarm.</p><p>The mother's voice alarms were equally effective whether or not the child's first name was used, according to the study published Oct. 25 in <i>The Journal of Pediatrics</i>.</p><p>\"These new findings put us one step closer to finding a smoke alarm that will be effective for children and practical for parents,\" said study lead author Dr. Gary Smith, director of the hospital's Center for Injury Research and Policy.</p><p>\"This study confirmed that a maternal voice alarm is better than a traditional high-pitch tone alarm for waking children and prompting their escape under conditions typical of homes,\" Smith said.</p><p>The researchers plan to assess if a generic female or male voice is as effective as a mother's voice, and to compare a voice alarm with a low-pitch tone alarm.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Library of Medicine has more on <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000390.htm\" target=\"_new\">fire safety at home</a>.</p>",

These hormones can stay higher, encouraging weight regain, <i>for more than a year</i>, even after the pounds start creeping back.</p><p>So the tendency for weight regain could be part of the body's natural instinct and not simply because you went back to old eating habits. To combat this, you need to keep a diet mindset for at least one year after you reach your goal weight.</p><p>But what can you do if that weight has already started coming back? First, go easy on yourself. Dieting takes dedicated effort and you don't want to waste energy blaming yourself.</p><p>Next, go back to all the diet principles that helped you lose weight. Do a self-checkup to see if your portions have gotten bigger recently, if you're eating too often, or if you're not being as careful about the quality of calories you choose as you were when you were losing weight.</p><p>It may also be that you aren't exercising as much as you did. While calorie restriction seems to increase appetite, exercise can reduce it as well as burn off calories. A study published in the <i>Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism</i> found that exercising after a meal may extend the feeling of satisfaction that the food gave you. This could be helpful in coping with smaller portions.</p><p>Just be sure not to overeat right before exercise. A small snack is OK, but you should wait two hours after a full meal so that digestion isn't fighting against your workout efforts.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>To help you calculate the right amount of calories to both get to and stay at your desired weight, use the <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/body-weight-planner\" target=\"_new\">body weight planner tool</a> from the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.</p>",

But the university recently announced that a years-long investigation discovered \"falsified and/or fabricated data\" in 31 papers from Anversa's laboratory, the <i>Washington Post</i> reported.</p><p>Anversa worked at the hospital until 2015. Last year, the hospital reached a $10 million settlement with the Justice Department to settle allegations that fake data was used by Anversa's laboratory in grant applications for federal funding.</p><p>Before working at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Anversa worked at New York Medical College. The college released a statement saying it launched an investigation after \"serious concerns\" had been raised about a 17-year-old study, the <i>Post</i> reported.</p><p>Last week, the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> retracted one Anversa laboratory paper and flagged two others with an \"expression of concern,\" and is waiting for more information on those two papers.</p><p>Before the NHLBI announcement, scientists had called for the study to be stopped.</p><p>\"I think that the trial should be halted, and they should have an external review,\" Darryl Davis, a cardiologist at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute studying how to regenerate heart tissue, told the <i>Post</i>.</p><p>\"The Anversa data comprised part of the rationale for that trial, and I think we have to understand better what these cells actually can do before we subject the patients to the risk of having an invasive procedure,\" Davis said.</p><p>Anversa's lawyer said his client stands by his studies' findings and that Anversa only learned from the Harvard probe that a longtime colleague who left his lab in 2013 had improperly altered images, the <i>Post</i> reported.</p><p>In many cases, those images can be replaced with correct images, and the results will still be valid, according to Anversa, his lawyer said.</p><p>\"There is nothing wrong with c-kit positive cardiac stem cells, and the trial will answer the questions concerning their efficacy in patients,\" Anversa said in an email, the <i>Post</i> reported.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Ninth Child Dies in Virus Outbreak at N.J.

Europeans, North Africans and Asians were in the middle of the range, <i>The Times</i> reported.</p><p>Since pelvic shape can be quite different, it's likely \"that the birthing process is also highly variable,\" Helen Kurki, an anthropology professor at the University of Victoria in Canada, told <i>The Times</i>.</p><p>She said this study contradicts the belief \"that there is one 'right' way to birth a baby,\" Kurki said, and indicates that might be better to take a a more individualized approach to childbirth.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Trump Announces Plan to Cut Drug Prices</b></span></p><p>Trying to cut high drug costs, the prices paid by Medicare for certain prescription drugs would be based on those in other advanced industrial nations, according to a proposal announced by the Trump administration.</p><p>\"This is a revolutionary change,\" President Donald Trump said in a speech on Thursday at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, <i>The New York Times</i> reported. \"Nobody's had the courage to do it, or they just didn't want to do it.\"</p><p>The move would cut costs for Medicare and save beneficiaries millions of dollars, according to the <i>Times</i>.</p><p>Under a demonstration project in half the country, Medicare would create and use and \"international pricing index\" to decide how much to pay for drugs covered by Part B of Medicare.</p><p>A recently-released government study said that Medicare paid 80 percent more than other advanced industrial countries for some of the most expensive prescription medicines, <i>The Times</i> reported.</p><p>The proposal was met with skepticism by Democrats.</p><p>\"It's hard to take the Trump administration and Republicans seriously about reducing health care costs for seniors two weeks before the election when they have repeatedly advocated for and implemented policies that strip away protections for people with pre-existing conditions and lead to increased health care costs for millions of Americans,\" said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, <i>The Times</i> reported.</p><p>A number of health care-related announcements have been made by the White House ahead of next month's midterm elections.

But could a simple vaccine help prevent a recurrence in stroke survivors someday?</p><p>That's the promise from new Japanese research conducted in mice.</p><p>A vaccine that would replace or be used alongside standard heart pills might help prevent secondary strokes and possibly heart attacks, saving many lives, said study co-author Dr. Hironori Nakagami, a professor at Osaka University.</p><p>\"Many stroke patients don't take their blood-thinning drugs as prescribed, which makes it more likely they will have another stroke,\" he explained. \"This vaccine might one day help solve this issue since it would only need to be injected periodically.\"</p><p>As the researchers noted, people who've suffered a stroke caused by a blood clot often taken blood-thinning drugs afterwards, to cut the risk of a second stroke. But these drugs can also raise the odds of serious bleeding.</p><p>However, in mice at least, the experimental vaccine protected against blood clots for more than two months. It did so without increasing the risk of bleeding or causing any autoimmune response, and it worked as well as the blood-thinner pill clopidogrel (Plavix), Nakagami's team reported Oct. 29 in <i>Hypertension</i>.</p><p>Of course, many findings from animal studies fail to pan out in humans. But Nakagami said his team members plan to test the vaccine in people in the future.</p><p>\"We are continuing our research in hopes of being able to start clinical trials between five and 10 years from now, but there are differences between mice and humans in how the vaccine will be recognized by the immune system,\" Nakagami said in a journal news release. \"We should be able to overcome such problems and believe this vaccine provides a very promising strategy in secondary prevention of stroke.\"</p><p>One U.S. stroke expert believes the strategy may hold promise.</p><p>\"Experimentally, this sounds promising,\" said Dr. Satjit Bhusri, a cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>However, the vaccine's effectiveness in stroke survivors \"may be more complicated,\" Bhusri noted. For example, a long-acting vaccine \"may increase the risk of bleeding around the prior stroke,\" he said. </p><p>\"Also, the lack of a reversal agent or an antidote if such an event occurs is an important factor in deciding the vaccine's overall utility,\" Bhusri said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The National Stroke Association has more on <a href=\"http://www.stroke.org/understand-stroke/what-stroke/ischemic-stroke\" target=\"_new\">ischemic stroke</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Oct. 30, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- When Rafe Poirrier smoked cigarettes, he smoked as soon as he woke, after eating, while driving, and whenever he took a break at work.</p> <p>\"I think my favorite (part) was socializing -- hanging out with smokers outside an office building, at a bar or in a park,\" said Poirrier, 51, of Houston.</p> <p>Physical cravings, combined with environmental, behavioral and personal triggers like those Poirrier experienced, can make quitting very difficult. In fact, a 2009 study showed that simply viewing an image of a person smoking can trigger someone who has recently quit to abandon their newfound resolve.</p> <p>The classic example of how a trigger works is from Psychology 101: Pavlov's dogs salivated every time they heard Ivan Pavlov ring a bell because the researcher always rang a bell before feeding them.</p> <p>\"We too have these conditioned responses,\" said clinical psychologist Barry J. Jacobs, a Pennsylvania-based clinical psychologist and health care consultant. \"Certain stimuli wind up giving us a certain response.\"</p> <p>Jacobs, who specializes in helping people form good health habits, adds that when a person smokes while drinking coffee, for example, cigarettes and coffee eventually become associated so that when the person drinks coffee he or she automatically wants a cigarette. \"Coffee becomes a trigger,\" he said.</p> <p>Triggers come in a few categories. Etta Short, director of clinical development and support at Optum, a corporate tobacco cessation program, said dependence on the nicotine in tobacco causes physical cravings that become paired with actions and emotions throughout the day.</p> <p>Triggers associated with behaviors include driving, finishing a meal or talking on the phone. Environmental triggers include spending time with smoking friends or being at a bar or music concert. And emotional triggers can include stress, boredom, anger or even pleasurable feelings.</p> <p>For Poirrier, who started smoking at age 20 while on a college exchange program in France, it was a business trip. Although he had quit smoking two years earlier, returning to Paris caused a personal trigger so strong and so unexpected that he relapsed.</p> <p>\"I think the need to smoke was fueled by nostalgia,\" said Poirrier, who smoked for more than two decades.</p> <p>His relapse was short-lived. He walked throughout the city smoking the cigarettes in that single pack for hours, then took the metro back to his hotel, smoked one last cigarette outside and tossed the remainder.</p> <p>That was in 2014. \"I haven't smoked since,\" he said.</p> <p>Poirrier initially quit when his workplace became smoke-free, which caused him to cut back from his three-pack-a-day habit to one pack a day. But he also had a constant cough, struggled to catch his breath when walking up stairs and was concerned about the effects of secondhand smoke on his kids. He said staying focused on the benefits of not smoking helps him to avoid triggers now.</p> <p>Tying your motivation to quit to those types of core values can really help, Short said. \"Living up to core values is a strong intrinsic reinforcement that helps the person stick to the plan and not let triggers get in the way of the resolve.\"</p> <p>Short said the way to turn your back on triggers is to anticipate them and make a plan with coping strategies, such as substitutes for smoking, distractions, relaxation techniques and motivating statements. She also recommends nicotine replacement therapy to manage physical cravings so that the person can stay focused.</p> <p>\"The first two to four weeks are the toughest,\" she said. \"But for many people, it takes much longer for all triggers to fade.\"</p>",

But you can prevent or delay it through healthy eating and active living, an expert suggests.</p><p>Diabetes affects more than 30 million Americans, and type 2 is the most common form. As many as one-third of Americans have prediabetes, but most don't know it, according to the American Association of Diabetes Educators.</p><p>Small lifestyle changes, like signing up for a morning exercise class, can help protect you from type 2 diabetes and its complications, according to association spokesperson Kathleen Stanley of Lexington, Ky. </p><p>Here, she shares some other tips: </p><p><b>Determine your personal risk. </b>Find out if your family has a history of diabetes, because that puts you at increased risk. Men have a higher risk than women. Your ethnic background is also important. Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Pacific Islanders are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes.</p><p><b>Assess your lifestyle and make any necessary changes.</b> Get at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week -- about a half-hour most days of the week. Plan three 10-minute walks during the day to get away from your desk. Climb the stairs instead of taking the elevator. </p><p><b>Watch your plate</b>. Eat a balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats and whole, nourishing foods.

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Jan. 7, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- With concerns about overfishing, it's shocking to learn that 40 percent of the edible U.S. seafood supply is lost or wasted every year -- and half of that is by consumers.</p><p>That's not only money down the drain, but also a loss of valuable nutrients like protein and omega-3 fatty acids.</p><p>To cut waste, calculate the amount of fish you really need before shopping based on the recipe you'll be following and portion sizes. It will also help to have a plan for any leftovers, such as a brown bag lunch the next day.</p><p>Be sure the seafood is fresh when you buy it. At the store, it should be refrigerated or displayed on ice in a case or under a cover. Fish should smell like the sea, not fishy or ammonia-like -- those are signs of spoilage in raw or cooked fish.</p><p>Seafood shopping tips:</p><ul><li>The eyes of whole fish should be clear and bulge slightly.</li> <li>Flesh should be shiny, not slimy, and spring back when pressed.</li><li>Shrimp flesh should be translucent.</li></ul><p>Consider buying frozen seafood, like bags of shrimp, which can be economical and used as needed.</p><p>At home, store fresh seafood properly so it won't spoil before you can eat it. If you'll cook it within two days, you can put it in the fridge, optimally on ice. Otherwise, wrap it tightly in paper and then plastic, and freeze.</p><p>Thaw frozen seafood gradually in a fridge overnight. If you're in a hurry, place it in a sealed plastic bag and immerse it in cold water. If you'll be cooking it immediately, you can microwave it on the defrost setting, but stop when the fish is just pliable and still a bit icy.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has detailed information on <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/food/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm077331.htm\" target=\"_new\">seafood storage</a>, including helpful videos.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Dec. 12, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- For certain men with early prostate cancer, choosing surgery over \"watchful waiting\" may add a few years to their lives, a new study suggests.</p><p>European researchers found that among nearly 700 men with earlier-stage prostate cancer, those who received surgery to remove the gland lived three years longer, on average, than those assigned to watchful waiting.</p><p>However, experts had major caveats about the study, which followed men who were treated for prostate cancer 20 to 30 years ago.</p><p>Namely, the patients had tumors that were larger and more aggressive than the norm for men diagnosed with early prostate cancer in recent years. So the results cannot be translated to most men diagnosed today, experts said.</p><p>\"This is an important study with useful information. But it won't change how we manage prostate cancer today,\" said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, interim chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society.</p><p>The study authors themselves made the same point.</p><p>Lead researcher Dr. Anna Bill-Axelson stressed that the patients were different from many men diagnosed with prostate cancer these days -- because they all had \"clinically detected\" cancer.</p><p>Many were diagnosed, for instance, after they developed symptoms of prostate cancer. In other cases, a doctor felt the tumor while doing a rectal exam for other reasons.</p><p>In other words, their tumors were advanced enough to cause symptoms or be palpable.</p><p>That's in sharp contrast to the situation today, Lichtenfeld said. In the United States, most men are now diagnosed through PSA screening, a blood test that picks up tiny prostate tumors that are not causing any problems.</p><p>Often, those men do not need immediate treatment, because prostate cancer is typically slow-growing and may never progress to the point of being life-threatening. Experts say that surgery to remove the gland -- which can cause incontinence and erectile dysfunction -- could do more harm than good.</p><p>Instead, men diagnosed through PSA screening can often take a wait-and-see approach -- where their cancer is monitored, and treated only if it progresses.</p><p>\"The last thing I'd want to see is headlines saying, 'Surgery is better than no surgery,'\" Lichtenfeld said. \"That's not what this study tells us.\"</p><p>The findings are based on 695 European men diagnosed with prostate cancer that was still confined to the gland.</p><p>All were younger than 75 and in good enough health that their life expectancy was at least 10 more years.</p><p>Between 1989 and 1999, the men were randomly assigned to either have their prostate gland removed or have their disease monitored.</p><p>By 2017, researchers found that 72 percent of surgery patients had died, versus 84 percent of men in the watchful-waiting group. The rate of death from prostate cancer, specifically, was also lower in the surgery group: 20 percent versus 31 percent.</p><p>On average, the study found, surgery patients lived three years longer.</p><p>But that added life expectancy would not necessarily be seen in men diagnosed through PSA screening, said Bill-Axelson, of Uppsala University in Sweden. </p><p>\"PSA adds a lead time of at least eight years,\" she said.</p><p>And many of those men, she added, will ultimately develop and die from other health conditions, like heart disease.</p><p>That was true even in this study, Bill-Axelson noted, despite the fact that patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer much later than they typically are today.</p><p>Overall, she said, about 70 percent of the men died of some other cause.</p><p>What about men today whose cancer is not caught by PSA screening, but after they develop symptoms?</p><p>Even then, immediate surgery is not always the best option, Lichtenfeld said. There are other factors to weigh, he explained -- such as the size and aggressiveness of the tumor, and a man's age and general health. An elderly man in poor health is unlikely to see any benefit from surgery.</p><p>But, Lichtenfeld said, if a man is like those in this study -- with a life expectancy of a decade or more -- surgery is likely to be recommended.</p><p>The study appears in the Dec. 13 issue of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Cancer Society has more on <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostate-cancer.html\" target=\"_new\">prostate cancer</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Oct. 30, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- If you insist on dressing your pet in a costume for Halloween, Fido will thank you for doing so in a safe and comfortable way, veterinarians suggest.</p><p>\"Make sure costumes are the appropriate size and fit for the pet. A costume that is too tight will be constricting and uncomfortable, and a costume that is too loose may rub and cause skin irritation; in either case, the pet may have difficulty moving around and will not enjoy their experience,\" said   Leni Kaplan. She is a clinician at Cornell University's Hospital for Animals.</p><p>\"Costumes with accessories that are easy to grab or pull off are not recommended; a pet might eat the accessory predisposing them to a gastrointestinal foreign body obstruction, which will require veterinary medical attention and possible surgery,\" Kaplan warned in a Cornell news release.</p><p> Katherine Houpt is professor emeritus of behavior medicine at Cornell's College of Veterinary Medicine. She suggested if you're planning to dress up your pet, \"make the costume a signal that good things are about to happen, like a walk. Another method is to pair a tiny, but delicious snack with the placement of the costume.\"</p><p>Costumes aren't the only thing you need be careful with: Halloween candy may be a treat for you, but could be dangerous for animals.</p><p> Kaplan explained that, for pets, \"candy and human snacks can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration and, in some circumstances, pancreatitis -- a serious illness which may require hospitalization. Restrict access to chocolate, coffee, caffeine, macadamia nuts, grapes, raisins and any food containing xylitol or psychoactive cannabinoids, such as marijuana.\"</p><p>It's also probably a bad idea to take your dog trick-or-treating.</p><p>\"It is not advised to take your dog trick-or-treating -- due to crowds, children, unfamiliar people dressed in unfamiliar outerwear (costumes, masks, and carrying props). Dogs who are normally fine in crowds may be scared or spooked, and may act aggressively or out of character,\" Kaplan said. </p><p>\"If you do take your pet trick-or-treating, make sure to dress your pet in brightly colored and reflective clothing so they are easy to see at night, and keep them on a leash at all times,\" Kaplan added.</p><p>Halloween decorations can also pose risks to your pet, the vets added.</p><p>\"Pumpkin is safe for pets to eat as long as it is not moldy. If your pet eats moldy pumpkin, contact a veterinarian immediately,\" Kaplan said.</p><p>\"Avoid using real candles, as pets are often drawn to the flickering light and warmth. They could burn themselves or start a fire if the candle or Jack-o'-Lantern is tipped over,\" she noted. \"Instead of candles, use battery-powered LED candles or glow sticks. Make sure your pet cannot access and eat the LED candles or glow sticks.\" </p><p>If Halloween hijinks are too much for your dog,  take steps to keep your pet calm.</p><p>For example, Houpt suggested, \"During parties or trick-or-treater visits, dogs can be confined in a room with a long-lasting treat or a food-dispensing toy. Play loud music or white noise so the dog is unaware of the people.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has more on <a href=\"https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/halloween-safety-tips\" target=\"_new\">Halloween safety for pets</a>.</p>",

In recent years, that has meant that somewhere between 2 percent to 5 percent of all pediatric visits to the emergency department have been related to mental illness concerns.</p><p>To drill down on the trends, the investigators sifted through data that had been collected by the Pediatric Health Information System.</p><p>The team focused on the overall number of mental health-related visits to an emergency department among children up to the age of 21.</p><p>The mental health issues covered by the analysis included: acute anxiety and delirium states; adjustment disorders and neuroses; alcohol abuse; drug abuse (including opioid abuse); bipolar disorders; childhood behavioral disorders; depression; major depressive disorders; disorders of personality and impulse control; eating disorders; psychosis; and schizophrenia.</p><p>During the study period, investigators determined that more than 293,000 children -- who were an average age of just over 13 -- had been diagnosed for some type of mental illness in a pediatric emergency room setting.</p><p>Overall, these visits rose dramatically during the study period, up from about 50 visits for every 100,000 children in 2012 to nearly 79 visits per 100,000 by 2016, according to the report.</p><p>But when broken down by race, the investigators found that the observed rise had not unfurled at an equal pace.</p><p>For example, nearly 52 out of every 100,000 white children were visiting an ER for a mental health issue by 2016. But among black children, that figure shot up to 78. Among other non-Hispanic minorities, the number rose to more than 79.</p><p>The majority of all pediatric mental health visits (55 percent) was covered by some form of public insurance, the study authors noted.</p><p>William Tynan is director of integrated health care with the American Psychological Association. He said he wouldn't be surprised if the study actually underestimates the degree to which mental health is the central concern among pediatric ER visits.</p><p>\"I would have estimated 10 percent, so the 2 percent to 5 percent  looks low to me,\" Tynan said.</p><p>As for the observed racial disparities, Tynan suggested that they are likely \"a function of social circumstances.\"</p><p>Poverty aside, \"families go to the emergency department because, in general, when there is a problem with a child  -- either medical or behavioral -- all parents feel a sense of urgency and want it addressed immediately,\" Tynan said.</p><p>But, \"we do know that children in poverty who have been exposed to social stressors -- and sometimes more trauma and violence -- have a higher risk of disorders, so the numbers on differences between black and white need to be compared with poverty rates,\" he added.</p><p>On that front, Tynan noted that some estimates put the poverty rate for black children at 27 percent, compared with just 10 percent among white children. Pew Research paints an even starker divide, he added: 38 percent among black kids versus 11 percent among their white peers.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on children and mental health at the <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/child-and-adolescent-mental-health/index.shtml\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institute of Mental Health</a>.</p>",

There were nearly 200 child deaths and about 80,000 adult deaths.</p><p>The number of U.S. deaths in a typical flu season usually ranges from 12,000 to 56,000.</p><p>The first step in protecting yourself from the flu is getting a flu shot.</p><p>\"Even if it doesn't prevent you from getting the flu, it can prevent you from getting really sick from it to the point of hospitalization or death. To me, that's a huge benefit,\" said Dr. Catharine Paules, an infectious diseases physician at Penn State Health.</p><p>Other preventive measures include: frequent hand washing; covering your face when you sneeze; avoiding sick people; and staying home when you're sick until you are fever-free for at least 24 hours.</p><p>But, Paules stressed in a university news release, \"Most importantly, get vaccinated!\" </p><p>In addition, people at high risk for developing complications from the flu can be given antiviral medications at the first sign of symptoms, she said. Those people include infants, people older than 65 and anyone with another medical condition that may weaken their immune system.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians has more on <a href=\"https://familydoctor.org/preventing-the-flu/?adfree=true\" target=\"_new\">preventing the flu</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 1, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- More men are delaying fatherhood, and new research suggests that might raise the risk of both birth complications and infant health problems.</p><p>When new fathers are aged 45 or older, there's an increased chance of preterm birth, infant seizures and even gestational diabetes in the mother, the study found.</p><p>\"When you think about fertility, don't forget the father. Having a baby is a team sport, and fathers do play a role as well,\" said study senior author Dr. Michael Eisenberg. He is director of male reproductive medicine and surgery at Stanford University School of Medicine in California.</p><p>\"Men shouldn't think of their runway as unlimited. There may be some health implications from waiting,\" he said.</p><p>But men shouldn't panic either. Eisenberg said to think of the potential risks like you would the lottery. If you buy two tickets, you've doubled your odds of winning, but you still probably won't hit the jackpot. Likewise, if you increase your risk of birth complications or child health problems slightly, the chances are still good that everything will be OK.</p><p>Eisenberg and his colleagues started the study because more men are choosing to have kids at older ages. Almost one in 10 children are fathered by a man over 40, the researchers noted. Yet, scant research has looked at how dad's age contributes to the way a pregnancy progresses and to the health of the child.</p><p>The study looked at data from more than 40 million births between 2007 and 2016. For infants, the researchers looked at birth weight, Apgar score at 5 minutes, admission to neonatal intensive care, seizures and the need for postpartum antibiotics. In moms, the researchers looked at the incidence of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia (dangerously high blood pressure during pregnancy). </p><p>The researchers controlled their findings to account for the mother's gestational age. They also controlled for education level, marital status, smoking history and access to care.</p><p>The investigators found that the greater the father's age, the greater the risk of problems. Men aged 45 and older had a 14 percent higher risk of a child being born prematurely. Men who were 50 or older had a 28 percent increased risk of that outcome, the study authors said.</p><p>Dads aged 45 and older also had an 18 percent higher risk of having an infant who had seizures compared to fathers between the ages of 25 and 34. They also had a 34 percent higher risk of having a partner who had gestational diabetes.</p> <p>Eisenberg said he can only speculate on why older dads might face these higher risks. He said there are some mutations in sperm DNA as men age, and those changes might impact the pregnancy and child. It's also possible that epigenetic changes that affect the embryo and placenta when there's an older father may also affect maternal health.</p><p>Dr. Anthony Vintzileos, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at NYU Winthrop Hospital in Mineola, N.Y., said the study may open the way for more research on how dad's age may play a role in pregnancy and child health.</p><p>But, he was quick to point out that the study cannot prove a cause-and-effect relationship, only an association.</p><p>And as for the connection to gestational diabetes, Vintzileos expressed concern that the researchers weren't able to adjust the data to control for the mother's weight. Maternal obesity is a risk factor for gestational diabetes.</p><p>Both Eisenberg and Vintzileos said these findings shouldn't lead anyone to change their family planning or life plans. They also both emphasized that it's too soon to make any changes in clinical practice based on this study. </p><p>The findings were published online Oct. 31 in the <i>BMJ</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Read more about older dads from the <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/getting-pregnant/expert-answers/paternal-age/faq-20057873\" target=\"_new\">Mayo Clinic</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 31, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Every year around Oct. 31, as horror films, haunted houses and pranksters in creepy costumes try their best to give you a fright, the question arises: Can a person literally be scared to death?</p> <p>The answer is a very conditional \"Yes.\" But, experts say, it's extraordinarily unlikely to happen from Halloween hijinks.</p> <p>\"Those circumstances are extremely rare when that happens,\" and pre-existing conditions are typically a factor, said Dr. Mark Estes, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.</p> <p>When a person is frightened or perceived to be in danger, the brain triggers a surge of adrenaline, which makes the heart beat faster and pushes the body instantly into \"fight-or-flight\" mode. It also affects the liver and pancreas, triggers perspiration and pushes blood toward major muscle groups.</p> <p>\"It's measured on how big the scare is,\" said Dr. Vincent Bufalino, a cardiologist and president of Advocate Medical Group in Downers Grove, Ill. He said the more dangerous adrenaline surges come from the body's response to a life-threatening situation or the stress of discovering the deceased body of a loved one.</p> <p>\"You can have a sudden cardiac-related event related to an adrenaline surge, but I think it would be a stretch to say you could get that from someone coming in a werewolf costume to your front door,\" he said. \"This is the kind of thing that you can't prepare for. If it happens, it happens, and you hope your body doesn't overreact to that event.\"</p> <p>People can typically get an adrenaline rush from skydiving or bungee jumping -- even while watching a horror flick from the couch. More dangerous adrenaline surges come from life-or-death moments such as getting out of the way of an oncoming car or fleeing a tornado.</p> <p>\"Swings of emotion and roller coasters are OK for people who are young, who have a healthy heart,\" Estes said. \"But certainly, in people with pre-existing risk factors or pre-existing cardiovascular disease, you want to reduce the environments in which you might be suddenly stressed like this.\"</p> <p>People are able to prepare themselves when they go to a haunted house or get on an amusement park ride, so their risk isn't the same as when they find themselves in life-threatening danger. </p> <p>\"The human mind and the human body do have the ability to prepare themselves for situations that can be anticipated that might be stressful and generally handle them much, much better,\" Estes said. \"It is the sudden, unexpected things which tend to cause a dramatic increase in heart rate and blood pressure and put people with pre-existing cardiovascular disease at risk.\"</p> <p>A possibly dangerous result of sudden stress may come from takotsubo cardiomyopathy, a weakening of the heart's main pumping chamber that is typically caused by emotional or physical stress. The temporary condition affects women significantly more than men.</p> <p>Also known as broken-heart syndrome, takotsubo cardiomyopathy is different from a heart attack in that arteries are not blocked but blood flow is negatively affected nonetheless.</p> <p>\"Adrenaline is a funny thing,\" Bufalino said. \"We can't measure it. The precipitating events are diverse. Your response to an event might be different than mine.\"</p> <p>Occasional rushes from adrenaline can be good for you, sometimes leading to increased cognitive function. But prolonged stress and an abundance of stress hormones over time can have negative effects, such as high blood pressure or anxiety.</p> <p>\"It's hard for us to be precise in saying, 'This event led to a certain amount of adrenaline that led to a cardiac event.' They're sporadic at best,\" Bufalino said.</p> <p>And there's little that can be done to prevent being frightened to death, he said, but being in good shape may help.</p> <p>\"Those folks who are used to dealing with adrenaline with exercise probably have a blunted response\" because their higher cardiovascular fitness level may allow their body to better handle an adrenaline surge, Bufalino said. \"I would speculate that aerobic exercise might be preventative or at least modify the body's response (to adrenaline).\"</p>",

She is an epidemiologist at the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, part of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Ussery pointed out that sitting may not be bad in itself, but is a proxy for not getting enough exercise. </p><p>Study co-author Peter Katzmarzyk added, \"In recent years, we have begun to understand the health hazards of excessive sitting.\" </p><p>Although all the reasons why prolonged sitting is unhealthy aren't known, Katzmarzyk speculates that \"when people sit, they deactivate the large muscles in their legs, and this has a host of metabolic consequences that seem to be harmful.\" </p><p>More and better efforts are needed to get people moving, said Katzmarzyk, who is associate executive director of population and public health sciences at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La. \"Programs that increase physical activity and reduce sitting might be especially effective at reducing health risks,\" he noted.</p><p>Another health expert agreed.</p><p>\"The three leading causes of premature death in the United States over the past quarter-century and more are tobacco use, poor diet and lack of physical activity,\" said Dr. David Katz, director of the Yale University Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center.</p><p>As smoking has declined, poor diet and lack of exercise are becoming the leading causes of early death and chronic disease, he explained.</p><p>Many people sit much of the day, and many do little actual exercise. \"One in 10 miss out on the benefits of both exercise and intermittent daily motion,\" Katz said. </p><p>Simply standing up, moving more and sitting less can be beneficial to your health, he noted.</p><p>\"With a growing menu of options, from standing and treadmill desks, to walking meetings, to chairs that involve constant motion -- it's a step nearly all should be able to find a way to take,\" Katz said. </p><p>The new edition of the U.S. Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans says that any amount of physical activity -- even two minutes' worth -- can add up to huge health benefits.</p><p> When the new guidelines were released recently, Adm. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said, \"Physical activity is about finding opportunities to add movement throughout the day as part of a bigger commitment to healthy living.\" </p><p> Being inactive causes 10 percent of early deaths in the United States, according to Giroir. If 25 percent of inactive people got at least the recommended 150 minutes of moderate  exercise a week, nearly 75,000 premature deaths could be prevented.</p><p>According to the new guidelines:</p><ul><li>A single bout of physical activity can sharpen your mind, reduce your anxiety, lower your blood pressure, improve your sleep and strengthen your body's ability to convert blood sugar into energy.</li><li>Regular physical activity can improve your brain health, reduce your risk of eight different forms of cancer, and lower your risk for excess weight gain.</li><li>Chronic health conditions improved by physical activity include osteoarthritis, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, anxiety and depression.</li></ul><p>The latest report was published Nov. 20 in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/index.htm?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fphysicalactivity%2Fbasics%2Fpa-health%2Findex.htm\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention </a> for more on physical activity.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Oct. 30, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Trick-or-treating is a Halloween tradition that can quickly turn disastrous, with new research showing a more than 40 percent spike in pedestrian deaths on the spooky holiday.</p><p>Kids wearing dark costumes, zigzagging across streets and popping out between parked cars are potentially tragic targets for drivers rushing home after work, explained study author Dr. Donald Redelmeier. He is a researcher at the University of Toronto's Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences.</p> <p>\"On Halloween, there is a 43 percent increased risk of a pedestrian death -- about four extra children are killed trick-or-treating,\" he said.</p><p>More boys than girls are killed, Redelmeier said. That's because boys often wear dark costumes -- \"pedestrian ninjas,\" he calls them.</p><p>The time when most deaths occurred was 6 p.m. That's when the really young kids are out and some folks are rushing home from work, he explained.</p><p>Children between the ages of 4 and 8 had the highest risk of being accidentally struck by a vehicle, the findings showed, and a lot more children are injured than killed.</p><p>\"Our study only looked at deaths,\" Redelmeier said. \"For every child who dies, there's probably one or two dozen children who are run over, survive, but are left with all sorts of disabilities.\"</p><p>But all these deaths and injuries could be prevented, he added.</p><p>Here's a few quick tips to follow:</p><ul><li>Look both ways before crossing the street.</li><li>Don't get distracted by your smartphone.</li><li>Instead of crisscrossing streets, go to houses on one side, and then the other -- so you're only crossing the street once.</li><li>Have reflectors or flashing lights on your kids' costumes. </li><li>Worry a lot more about road safety and a lot less about hidden dangers like razorblades in your child's candy bag. </li><li>Drivers need to slow down in residential neighborhoods.</li></ul><p>Dr. Barbara Pena, research director of the  emergency medicine department at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami, said she sees more injuries on Halloween. </p><p>\"We see big increases in trauma because all these kids are walking around in dark costumes at night,\" Pena said. \"We always have to stack the emergency department with extra people because we see a jump in injuries.\"</p><p>Pena also thinks that communities can help by closing streets so kids can trick-or-treat safely. In addition, parents need to keep a tight leash on their kids to prevent accidents and deaths. </p><p>Using data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Redelmeier and his colleagues looked at the number of pedestrian deaths on Oct. 31, from 1975 to 2016. They focused on the hours between 5 p.m. and midnight. </p><p>The investigators compared these deaths with those occurring during the same time period on Oct. 24 and Nov. 7.</p><p>Over 42 years, 608 pedestrians died on the 42 Halloween evenings, while 851 died on the 84 other evenings used for comparison.</p><p>The absolute death rates averaged 2.07 per hour on Halloween and 1.45 on other evenings, the researchers found. </p><p>The absolute risk of pedestrian deaths per 100 million Americans was small, Redelmeier's team noted. And that rate dropped from 5 to less than 3 deaths per 100 million Americans during the years between 1975 and  2016. </p><p>According to Maureen Vogel, a spokeswoman for the National Safety Council, \"There's no reason to keep kids from trick-or-treating. There's just more reason, in light of this study and others, to be aware of your surroundings and exercise caution.\"</p><p>The report was published online Oct. 30 in the journal <i>JAMA Pediatrics</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more Halloween safety tips, visit the <a href=\"https://www.nsc.org/home-safety/tools-resources/seasonal-safety/autumn/halloween\" target=\"_new\">National Safety Council</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 8, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Plyometrics isn't a new technique, but it's getting renewed attention because of its value as a training tool, the American Council on Exercise explains.</p><p>Its original name, jump training, describes its focus. Movements are similar to those used in downhill skiing, basketball and even tennis. So it's a great way to train for those sports, but almost anyone can benefit.</p><p>One caveat though: plyometrics is a type of exercise that isn't for people who are currently out of shape or have orthopedic issues.</p><p>Plyometrics uses simple exercises like hops and jumps that alter your muscles' cycle of lengthening and shortening to increase their power. Jumps should always begin from ground level, from and onto cushioned surfaces for both ease and safety. Jumping on and off a low box or over cones or foam barriers are all simple options.</p><p>Low-impact landings are key. Land from toe to heel, use the entire length of your feet as rockers to help disperse the force of the landing, and keep knees from swaying to better distribute that force through the muscles that protect these joints. The experts at the American Council on Exercise suggest visualization to lighten your landings: Picture yourself landing like a feather or springing back easily like a coil.</p><p>Under the right supervision, youngsters and teens can benefit from plyometrics training, according to the American College of Sports Medicine. It may help strengthen bones, keep kids at a healthy weight, and decrease sports-related injuries, especially for girls who are at higher risk than boys. Common childhood pastimes like hopscotch, jumping rope and jumping jacks are actually all examples of plyometrics.</p><p>Because of its explosive nature and very specific movements, instruction makes sense at every age. Also, as with strength training, allow 48 to 72 hours between sessions to give muscles time to recover.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Council on Exercise has more on how to use <a href=\"https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/lifestyle/blog/6692/plyometrics-controlled-impact-maximum-power\" target=\"_new\">plyometrics</a> safely.</p>",

Try to place items in a few smaller bags instead of one large one. When lifting luggage, stand alongside it and bend at the knees, lifting the luggage with your leg muscles. Once lifted, hold luggage close to your body.</p><p>Don't twist when lifting and carrying luggage. Point your toes in the direction you're going and turn your entire body in that direction. Don't carry bulky luggage for long periods of time. When possible, use the airline's baggage service when you have heavy luggage.</p><p>Carry luggage in both hands, rather than one hand off to the side. This can decrease stress to the spine and reduce the risk of developing elbow problems.</p><p>Carry, don't drag, rolling luggage when climbing stairs.</p><p>If you're using a backpack, it should have two padded and adjustable shoulder straps to equally balance the weight. Pack heavier items low and towards the center.</p><p>When using a duffel or shoulder bag, switch sides often.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/family/holiday/\" target=\"_new\">holiday health and safety</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 31, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Long belittled as inconsequential, the appendix is hardly the rock star of body organs. But its reputation may get a boost from new research that suggests that removing it may lower the risk for Parkinson's disease.</p><p>The finding follows an analysis that examined how appendix removal surgery (appendectomy) affected Parkinson's risk among 1.6 million Swedish residents.</p><p>The study couldn't prove cause and effect, but it found that appendectomy lowered Parkinson's risk by roughly 20 percent.</p><p>\"This is a tissue that most people consider to be a useless organ. It's attached to the large intestine, and it's removed as a very common surgical practice,\" said study author Viviane Labrie. She's a neuroscientist with the Center for Neurodegenerative Science at the Van Andel Research Institute in Grand Rapids, Mich.</p><p>The new findings suggest, \"that the appendix may be a tissue site that plays a role in the initiation of Parkinson's disease,\" she said.</p><p>Why? \"The hallmark pathology of Parkinson's disease in the brain is Lewy bodies, which is characterized by a clumped form of a protein called alpha-synuclein,\" Labrie explained.</p><p>What's more, clumps of this protein are found in the intestinal tract and are \"present in the appendixes of all of us,\" sometimes years before Parkinson's symptoms arise, she said.</p><p>So, \"we think that if in rare events [such protein clumps] were to escape the appendix and enter the brain, this could lead to Parkinson's disease.\" How? Simply by traveling up the nerve that connects the intestinal tract directly to the brain, Labrie said.</p><p>Parkinson's attacks the nervous system and results in a progressive loss of both motor function and many non-motor functions.</p><p>Common among the complications of Parkinson's is the onset of gastrointestinal dysfunction -- including constipation -- which can actually precede mobility loss by as much as 20 years. This signaled a potential link between Parkinson's onset and the appendix, the researchers explained.</p><p>To investigate, researchers pored over data previously collected by the Swedish National Patient Registry. The registry is unique because since 1964 it has maintained a full record of diagnoses and surgeries for a huge swath of the Swedish patient pool.</p><p>Of the 1.6 million covered patients, more than 550,000 had undergone an appendectomy.</p><p>After following Parkinson's incidence for up to 52 years post-surgery, investigators found that Parkinson's was ultimately diagnosed in 1.2 out of every 1,000 appendectomy patients, compared to a risk of 1.4 out of every 1,000 people in the general Swedish population.</p> <p>That meant that Parkinson's risk had dropped by 19.3 percent among those who had had their appendix removed.</p><p>What's more, after honing in on the specific experiences of about 850 Parkinson's patients, the researchers determined that appendix removal was also associated with a 3.6-year delay in the onset of Parkinson's among those who had the surgery and still developed the disease.</p><p>Still, Labrie stressed that \"we are not saying that having an appendix causes Parkinson's disease, and that all people should go out and remove their appendix.\"</p><p>Rather, \"we think that what actually distinguishes a person that goes on to develop Parkinson's from one that does not is not the presence of this pathology, but rather the factors that trigger departure from the appendix.\" That raises the prospect for developing new therapies designed to prevent such protein clumps from escaping the appendix.</p><p>The findings were published in the Oct. 31 issue of <i>Science Translational Medicine</i>.</p><p>Dr. Rachel Dolhun is vice president of medical communications for the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. She described the link between Parkinson's and the appendix as \"particularly interesting.\"</p><p>\"But it's important to stress these are associations and do not establish causation,\" she said. \"In other words, having an appendectomy will not definitely decrease [the] risk of Parkinson's.\"</p><p> Dolhun added, \"Investigating the association between the gut and brain further could potentially lead to deeper understandings of the causes of Parkinson's, as well as how Parkinson's starts and progresses, and how to intervene to stop it. But much work remains to be done.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more  on  Parkinson's disease at <a href=\"https://www.michaeljfox.org/understanding-parkinsons/i-have-got-what.php\" target=\"_new\">The Michael J.

In fact, the study team found that 70 percent of the Down syndrome patients who died during the 5.5-year study period had dementia.</p><p>And \"we found that people who had two or more other health conditions developed dementia earlier,\" Hithersay added. \"So it is vital that common health conditions are given appropriate attention and treatment in these older adults.\"</p><p>Fifty years ago, life expectancy was typically just 10 years among Down syndrome patients, the researchers said. Often, deaths occurred within the first year, as a consequence of congenital heart defects.</p><p>But better care has extended average life expectancy to nearly 64, with respiratory illness the main cause of death.</p><p>But longer life expectancy has yielded a new problem: early onset dementia.</p><p>\"People with Down syndrome are at increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease dementia at a younger age, approximately 20 years earlier in life, as compared to the general population,\" noted Hithersay.</p><p>Investigators peg the average age of dementia onset at 55, with upwards of nearly 90 percent of patients receiving a dementia diagnosis by the time they hit 65.</p><p>But to what degree premature death among Down syndrome patients is directly linked to early onset dementia has remained an open question.</p><p>To explore the issue, investigators tracked 211 British Down syndrome patients. All were 36 years old and up, and nearly a third were diagnosed with dementia prior to the study's launch, at an average age of almost 52.</p><p>By the study's conclusion, 27 patients had died. Of these, 19 had dementia. Investigators determined that those with dementia were five times more likely to die early than those without dementia.</p><p>Among those who died seemingly dementia-free, epilepsy appeared to be the only \"significant factor\" implicated. The team theorized that some of them may in fact have struggled with undiagnosed dementia.</p><p>The findings were published online Nov. 19 in the journal <i>JAMA Neurology</i>.</p><p>Dr. Michael Rafii is medical director of the Alzheimer's Therapeutic Research Institute at the Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California in San Diego. He wrote an editorial that accompanied the study.</p><p>\"The findings from this study highlight the urgent need for research into treatments to prevent or delay\" Alzheimer's in Down syndrome patients, Rafii said.</p><p>\"With advances in medical care and improvements in the overall health of individuals with [Down syndrome], life expectancy has increased dramatically,\" Rafii noted. \"However, along with this longer life span comes the prospect of an increased risk for of developing dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.\"</p><p>But, \"although most people with Down syndrome will experience brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease as they age, not everyone will develop dementia, and it is not inevitable for all,\" Rafii stressed. \"This is an important phenomenon and needs much further study.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Child Health and Human Development has more on <a href=\"https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/downsyndrome\" target=\"_new\"> Down syndrome</a>.</p>",

Although no one has died, illnesses have been so severe that in 13 cases patients had to be hospitalized, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday.</p><p>So who's most at risk from E. coli?</p><p>Dr. Robert Glatter is an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City who's seen the effects of infection with the gastrointestinal bug firsthand. It's not a minor ailment, he said.</p><p>\"In general, symptoms of E. coli infection generally begin about three to four days after consuming the bacteria, and may include abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and watery or bloody diarrhea, along with fever,\" Glatter said.</p><p>And while healthy people who battle a bout of E. coli typically recover within five to seven days, the illness can be more protracted -- and even deadly -- for people already made vulnerable by chronic disease or advanced age.</p><p>\"People with diabetes, kidney disease or those with cancer or autoimmune disease run the risk of a more severe illness,\" Glatter explained.</p><p>The particular strain of E. coli detected in the current lettuce outbreak -- E. coli O157:H7 -- is particularly nasty, he noted.</p><p>\"Most strains of E. coli do not actually cause diarrhea, but E. coli O157 produces a powerful toxin that injures the inner lining of the small intestine, leading to bloody diarrhea,\" Glatter said. Even a tiny amount of ingested bacteria could spur this type of illness.</p><p>\"It can make people much more ill, and may lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure, in some cases,\" he said.</p><p>Indeed, the CDC has reported one such case already in the latest outbreak.</p><p>In many cases, antibiotics are used to help beat back an E. coli infection, but these drugs can affect the kidneys, Glatter noted.</p><p>\"Antibiotics may be necessary in certain cases, so it's important to see your doctor if you have continued and severe symptoms such as fever, bloody diarrhea, and you are not able to eat or drink,\" he said.</p><p>However, in the case of E. coli O157:H7, \"taking antibiotics may actually increase your risk of developing kidney failure, so it's important to speak with your health care provider if you should develop severe symptoms,\" Glatter advised.</p><p>And if you do think you might be sick with E. coli, or any other foodborne illness, make sure you don't spread it to those near you.</p><p>The bacterium \"can be transmitted person-to-person, so it's vital that anyone who is potentially infected wash their hands thoroughly and not share utensils, cups or glasses,\" Glatter said. \"This also goes for bath towels. Linens also need to be washed in hot water and treated with bleach.\"</p><p>He noted that \"ground beef, unpasteurized milk, fresh produce, and contaminated water are common sources of E. coli bacteria.\"</p><p>As for the current outbreak, cases have so far been reported in California (10 cases), Connecticut (1 case), Illinois (2 cases), Massachusetts (2 cases), Maryland (1 case), Michigan (7 cases), New Hampshire (2 cases), New Jersey (3 cases), New York (2 cases), Ohio (1 case) and Wisconsin (1 case).</p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration noted that romaine lettuce typically has a shelf life of about 21 days, so contaminated produce could still be on store shelves or in people's refrigerators. For that reason, \"consumers throughout the U.S. should not eat romaine lettuce until further notice,\" the agency advised.</p><p>The exact source of the outbreak remains unclear, but tests are being done on romaine lettuce throughout the U.S. market.</p><p>\"The quick and aggressive steps we're taking today are aimed at making sure we get ahead of this emerging outbreak, to reduce risk to consumers, and to help people protect themselves and their families from this foodborne illness outbreak,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in an agency news release on Tuesday. \"This is especially important ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, when people will be sitting down for family meals.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Find out more about E. coli illness at the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/ecoli-symptoms.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Dec. 7, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- On the surface, the news looks good for America's mental health -- a new report shows the rate of people with serious psychological distress is declining, and more folks are seeking mental health care on an outpatient basis.</p><p>But the haves are edging out the have-nots when it comes to mental health care, a closer peek at the numbers reveals.</p><p>About one-third of people with serious distress -- signs of depression, anxiety or deeper mental problems -- do not get the care they need, according to the study.</p><p>Instead, much of the growth in mental health care is being driven by people suffering from little to no psychological distress, the researchers found.</p><p> \"Our study shows there's a mismatch in the U.S. between those with the greatest need who may not be getting mental health care they need and a growing number of Americans who are getting treatments -- including psychiatric drugs -- they may not need,\" said lead researcher Dr. Mark Olfson. He's a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, in New York City.</p><p>For the study, Olfson and his colleagues analyzed data from nearly 140,000 U.S. adults who took part in a regular federal health survey between 2004 and 2015.</p><p>The number of people with serious psychological distress declined from 4.8 percent to 3.7 percent during that period, the survey results showed.</p><p>That's good news, given increases in opioid overdoses, suicide rates and other indications of a very distraught America, Olfson said.</p><p>\"Against that background, I think this is a welcome trend that cuts against a common impression that there's been this increase overall in distress within the United States,\" he added.</p><p>The overall percentage of Americans using any outpatient mental health care grew from 19 percent to 23 percent at that same time, the findings showed.</p><p>However, the people receiving help aren't necessarily those who need it the most.</p><p>The proportion of seriously distressed people who received outpatient mental health care rose from 54 percent to 68 percent. \"That means you also have a third or so who aren't receiving any mental health care,\" Olfson said.</p><p>At the same time, the proportion of people with little or no distress nonetheless receiving mental health care rose from 17 percent to 21 percent.</p><p>Prescriptions for antidepressants and other psychiatric drugs also are increasing, from 50 percent to 64 percent among those with serious distress, and 15 to 19 percent for those with little or no distress, according to the report.</p><p>But fewer than 5 percent of the tens of thousands of people surveyed had serious distress. That means those who are in real need account for a significantly smaller portion of the overall increase in mental health care, the researchers said.</p><p>The findings were published online recently in the journal <i>JAMA Psychiatry</i>.</p><p>These results jibe with research going back decades with the American health care system, said Keith Humphreys, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University.</p><p>Much of the U.S. market for mental health care is cash-based, involving people seeking self-improvement, self-understanding or the means to cope with minor anxieties, Humphreys said.</p><p>\"A lot of it comes out of people just buying it themselves, like they might have an exercise coach or something,\" he added. \"That's fine, but those problems are nothing compared to having schizophrenia and being on a street corner shivering and thinking the CIA is chasing you. We've always had much more trouble getting that much more severe group what they need.\"</p><p>But Olfson said there are reasons beyond money why distressed people aren't getting the care they need.</p><p>The stigma against seeking mental health care might dissuade people from reaching out, he suggested. Their disorder also might get in the way of seeking help; for example, a depressed person might be so demoralized that he or she feels therapy wouldn't benefit them.</p><p>The United States is also contending with an ongoing shortage of mental health professionals, Olfson pointed out.</p><p>\"There are lots of places in the United States, particularly in rural and remote regions, where there are very few mental health providers,\" Olfson said.</p><p>The current situation might be somewhat better than shown in this study. Humphreys noted that the last survey period ended in 2015, just as the Affordable Care Act began drastically expanding insurance coverage in the United States.</p><p>\"The study stops right as we dramatically expand mental health coverage, including to lower-income people,\" Humphreys said. \"There's reason to be optimistic and think in the future this will be different.\"</p><p>Olfson suggested one means of expanding mental health treatment is to train and empower primary care doctors to serve as front-line providers.</p><p>\"Most Americans in the course of a year make at least one visit to their primary care doc,\" he said. \"They may be a point of entry that's underutilized for people that have serious psychological distress.\"</p><p>But there's a downside to relying on family doctors to fill the gap in mental health care, said Dr. Robert Trestman, chair of psychiatry and behavioral medicine for Carilion Clinic in Roanoke, Va.</p><p>\"When things are at a mild level of problematic distress, the best treatment would be psychotherapy, not medication,\" Trestman said. \"But there was a significant increase in the use of medication in those with less distress.\"</p><p>Trestman suspects that primary care clinicians faced with mentally distressed patients are resorting to the prescription pad rather than referring them for therapy.</p><p>\"They will frequently offer a prescription for an antidepressant, where psychotherapy might have been healthier for the individual,\" Trestman said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db203.htm\" target=\"_new\">serious psychological distress</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 31, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Surgeons have long turned to a minimally invasive means of hysterectomy when treating early stage cervical cancer.</p><p>However, two new studies could change all that. Both found the approach was linked to a higher rate of cancer recurrence, plus worse long-term   survival, compared to more \"open\" surgeries.</p><p>\"Minimally invasive surgery was adopted as an alternative to open radical hysterectomy before high-quality evidence regarding its impact on survival was available,\" said Dr. Jose Alejandro Rauh-Hain of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who helped lead the study.</p><p>Speaking in a university news release, Rauh-Hain said he was \"surprised\" to find that the technique \"negatively affected oncologic outcomes for women with early stage cervical cancer.\"</p><p>Dr. Alexander Melamed, a gynecologic oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston, was co-lead researcher on the study with Ruah-Hain. He noted that a second study --  this time an international clinical trial -- has found similar results.</p><p>Taken together, the data should change clinical practice, Melamed said in an MGH news release.</p><p>\"Personally, I will not offer minimally invasive radical hysterectomy to patients who come to me for cervical cancer treatment, until compelling new research demonstrates a minimally invasive approach that does not carry these risks,\" he said.</p><p>Both studies were published online Oct. 31 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>Robots and laparoscopy</b></p><p>Each year, over 13,000 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed in the United States, and nearly 4,200 women will die of the disease, according to the American Cancer Society. Radical (complete) hysterectomy is standard treatment.</p><p>As the researchers explained, oncologic surgeons largely abandoned \"open\" surgeries for radical hysterectomy years ago with the advent of small-incision, laparoscopic techniques.</p><p>The use of robot-assisted surgery only accelerated the move away from traditional \"open\" operations.</p><p>Initial studies appeared to support the use of the minimally invasive techniques. However, patient follow-up times in those trials were relatively short. The two new studies were different,  tracking outcomes for more than four years after surgery.</p><p>In the study led by Ruah-Hain and Melamed, researchers assessed outcomes for nearly 2,500 patients in the U.S. National Cancer Database who underwent radical hysterectomy for early stage cervical cancer from 2010 through 2013.</p><p>Of those, about half had minimally invasive surgery and about half had open surgery.</p><p>In the four years after their procedures, 94 patients in the minimally invasive group died from any cause, compared with 70 patients in the open surgery group. That works out to a 9 percent risk of death in the minimally invasive group and a 5 percent risk in the open surgery group -- a significant difference, the study authors said.</p><p>The investigators also analyzed data from a second U.S. health database, called Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER). That analysis showed that four-year post-op survival rates were stable before 2006,  when minimally invasive radical hysterectomy began to be widely used to treat early stage cervical cancer.</p><p>But <i>after</i> 2006, survival rates began to fall by about 0.8 percent per year, the team reported. That suggests a true cause-and-effect relationship.</p><p>\"This result is very surprising, since randomized trials have demonstrated the safety of minimally invasive surgery for uterine, gastric and colorectal cancers,\" Melamed said.</p><p>\"Our own work using similar methods to investigate minimally invasive surgery for ovarian cancer found no association with increased mortality, so it seems clear that something very different may be going on in cervical cancer,\" he added.</p><p><b>More surprises</b></p><p>The second study published in <i>NEJM</i> was a clinical trial led by Dr. Pedro Ramirez, also of the Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. He said that long patient follow-up was key.</p><p>\"Until now, data [has] focused primarily on surgical outcomes and the immediate period after, such as the recovery of the patient, length of stay, transfusion needs, and overall return to functional daily activities,\" Ramirez explained.</p><p>His team's study was \"the first to prospectively compare the two surgical approaches and evaluate oncologic [cancer] outcomes, including disease-free and overall survival and recurrence rates,\" Ramirez explained in the cancer center news release.</p><p>The trial involved 631 patients with early stage cervical cancer treated at 33 medical centers worldwide.  Again, women were randomly selected to receive minimally invasive or open radical hysterectomies.</p><p>Then came the surprising result:  Women who got the minimally invasive technique had triple the odds of disease progression over the next 4.5 years, compared with standard surgery, the team found.</p><p>And while 96.5 percent of patients who got open surgery were still alive without any signs of cervical cancer more than four years later, the same was true for only 86 percent of women who'd undergone the minimally invasive approach.</p><p>The results were so striking that the study was cut short in 2017 to safeguard patients.</p><p>The research \"reinforces the need for more randomized clinical trials in the field of surgery,\" Ramirez said.</p><p>Melamed added that \"it's important to note that our study doesn't explain why [the risk of death] is higher among women who have minimally invasive surgery.\"</p><p>He speculated that  \"there could be something technical about minimally invasive radical hysterectomy that is different from the open procedure and makes a difference for long-term survival. An alternative explanation is that U.S. surgeons could have been less experienced with the minimally invasive procedure than with open surgery during the study period.\"</p><p><b>Patient-doctor discussions</b></p><p>Melamed said patients can still opt for the minimally invasive approach,  but only after considering the new data.</p><p>\"Surgeons who wish to offer minimally invasive radical hysterectomy to cervical cancer patients must ensure they are informed of these risks,\" Melamed said.</p><p>Dr. Ioannis Alagkiozidis directs gynecologic oncology at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City. He wasn't involved in the studies, but agreed they could change clinical practice.</p><p>Minimally invasive hysterectomy was introduced because it led to \"decreased hospital stays and blood loss, decreased pain and faster recovery,\" Alagkiozidis explained.</p><p>But now, \"given the burden of published evidence, minimally invasive surgery cannot be considered as the standard of care for patients with early cervical cancer,\" he said.</p><p>Further research might still support a role for the approach, however.  Alagkiozidis noted that most of the minimally invasive operations included in the studies did not include robotic technologies.</p><p> \"Well-designed studies comparing robot-assisted laparoscopic to conventional laparoscopic and open procedures are needed,\" he said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/types/cervical/patient/cervical-treatment-pdq\" target=\"_new\">cervical cancer treatment</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 19, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Almost 8 percent of American children have food allergies, and 1 in 5 of those kids suffers an allergic reaction severe enough to wind up in the hospital, a new study finds. </p><p>\"Childhood food allergies are relatively common and should be taken seriously, with 1 in 5 having a reaction that takes them to the emergency room every year,\" said lead researcher Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.</p><p>The most common allergies are to peanuts, milk, shellfish, tree nuts, egg, fish, wheat, soy and sesame, Gupta said.</p><p>Peanut is the most common food allergy, affecting about 2 million children, followed by milk (1 million), shellfish (1 million), tree nuts (1 million), eggs (nearly 1 million), fish (less than a half million), wheat and soy (.4 million) and sesame (.15 million), she said.</p><p>Among children allergic to sesame, at least 1 in 3 had a reaction severe enough to visit the emergency room in the past year, Gupta said. </p><p>Senior author Dr. Kari Nadeau, director of the Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research at Stanford University in California, said food allergies are on the rise because children are not exposed to a variety of foods at a young age. </p><p>People live a cleaner life, she said. \"We are not exposed to the farm, animals and dirt. We know that if you have a dog at home during the first year of life, it protects you against allergies,\" Nadeau said. </p><p>Another way to prevent food allergies is to expose children early to the foods that cause most of them, she said.</p><p>\"Exposing children to these food late has actually caused an increase in food allergies, Nadeau said.  </p><p>In addition, adequate amounts of vitamin D and preventing dry skin are also important in reducing the odds of developing a food allergy, she said. </p><p>Prevention is the only treatment available, Nadeau said. That means avoiding the foods one is allergic to, but that can be a challenge. </p><p>It's often hard to tell if a prepared food contains possible allergens. Although food packaging is often labeled, the law in the United States doesn't require that sesame appear on a list of ingredients, as it must in Canada, Europe, Australia and Israel, Nadeau said. </p><p>For example, a 15-year-old girl who was allergic to sesame died in June after eating a sandwich on a baguette that contained sesame, but was not labeled as such, Nadeau said. </p><p>In the study, Gupta, Nadeau and colleagues asked nearly 40,000 parents if their children had food allergies. Specifically, the researchers asked if the children had a suspected food allergy, if it was diagnosed by a doctor, what were the symptoms of the allergic reaction and how it was treated.</p><p>The research team also found that 41 percent of kids with food allergies had a prescription for an epinephrine auto-injector, such as EpiPen. </p><p>The most severe allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis, which causes the airway to swell, making it hard or impossible to breathe. Injecting epinephrine rapidly reduces swelling and opens the airway. Epinephrine can save the life of someone having an allergic reaction, which is why people who are at risk for allergic reactions are encouraged to carry the drug with them at all times.</p><p>\"Parents who suspect that their child has a food allergy should consult a physician for testing so that foods are not unnecessarily avoided and that, if an allergy is confirmed, an epinephrine auto-injector can be prescribed for emergency treatment,\" Gupta said.</p><p>In addition to more kids having food allergies, many don't outgrow them, Nadeau said. \"It does not look like food allergies are getting better, and it does not look like they're getting less,\" she said.</p><p>\"It's starting to look like those who have food allergies in childhood will have them in adulthood,\" Nadeau said.</p><p>Dr. Vivian Hernandez-Trujillo, medical director of the division of allergy and immunology at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami, said, \"This important article highlights the public health epidemic that we have with food allergies.\" She was not part of the study.</p><p>Hernandez-Trujillo hopes that the recent changes in the recommendation about when infants should be introduced to solid food, which call for an earlier introduction, will turn the tide and stop the increase, but that will take years.</p><p>The report was published online Nov. 19 in the journal <i>Pediatrics </i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology for more on <a href=\"https://acaai.org/allergies/types/food-allergy\" target=\"_new\">food allergies</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 29, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Climbing enthusiast Jim Ewing lost his left foot in the aftermath of a 50-foot fall off a Cayman Islands cliff.</p><p>But Ewing is scaling rock walls again with the aid of a robotic ankle and foot he works as well as his former flesh-and-blood version, thanks to a groundbreaking amputation procedure that eliminates the \"phantom limb\" effect. That's a disorienting side effect that makes it hard for patients to work their prosthetic limbs properly.</p><p>This August -- a little more than two years after his amputation -- Ewing successfully tackled the Lotus Flower Tower, a renowned 8,430-foot peak located in the Northwest Territories of Canada.</p><p>\"When I'm connected to the robotic ankle, I can use it as if it's my very own,\" said Ewing, 54, of Falmouth, Maine. \"It's a very natural transition going from no foot to all of a sudden having my foot back. I don't have to retrain my brain or retrain my muscles to do anything. It's pretty much a one-for-one replacement.\"</p><p>Losing a limb causes many disconcerting effects, as the brain tries to interpret signals from an arm or leg that's no longer there.</p><p>One of the oddest might be the fact that not only do people feel as though they have a phantom limb, but that limb's position in their mind often doesn't match the location of their prosthetic replacement.</p><p>\"They can perceive a foot that is somewhere in space, but oftentimes is disembodied,\" said lead researcher Dr. Matthew Carty, director of the Lower Extremity Transplant Program at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. \"It doesn't map geographically to where their prosthetic foot is. It's kind of floating to the side, or they may feel it's encased in a hard block and they can't move it.\"</p><p>These misleading signals can make it difficult for amputees to learn how to work a prosthetic limb properly.</p><p><b>New surgery erases disconnect with prosthetic limb</b></p><p>In July 2016, Ewing became the first person to undergo an amputation procedure designed to eliminate this disconnect.</p><p>Named after him, the Ewing Amputation recreates the normal tug-and-stretch relationship of muscles that occurs during normal movement of legs or arms.</p><p>When you move a limb, muscles on one side contract while muscles on the other side stretch, Carty explained. For example, when you lift a foot off the ground and move your ankle around, you'll feel muscles on both sides of your leg moving back and forth.</p><p>Researchers have learned that as they work, the muscles are sending constant signals to the brain's proprioceptive sensory system. Proprioception is your ability to know the exact position of your limbs at all times, allowing you to precisely coordinate their movements.</p><p>\"It transmits information back to our brain where the limb is in space without us having to look at it,\" Carty said.</p><p>Traditional amputation screws up these signals by decoupling the muscles, Carty said. The lack of push-and-pull muscle feedback confuses the brain, creating misleading perceptions of a disembodied phantom limb.</p><p>A Ewing Amputation recreates the push/pull dynamic by surgically connecting muscles that normally operate in pairs, forcing one muscle to stretch in response to the other muscle contracting.</p><p>Fed the normal muscle signals, the brain is better able to make a person's perception of their lost limb line up with their new prosthetic, Carty said.</p><p>\"The phantom limb the patient perceives maps geographically over their prosthetic device,\" Carty said. \"When they think about moving their phantom limb, their brain superimposes that phantom limb over the prosthetic limb.\"</p><p>Amputees also often feel sensations of itching or pain associated with their phantom limb, as the brain struggles to make sense of discordant signals. The Ewing Amputation appears to prevent those sensations, the researchers added.</p><p><b>Success with procedure grows</b></p><p>Since Ewing, doctors have performed this amputation procedure on 11 more patients, Carty said. Ten lost their leg below the knee, and one lost their leg above the knee.</p><p>\"At this point, we have enough data to say we think we've figured out a better way to do amputations, and we're in the process of testing that in a variety of different clinical scenarios,\" Carty said.</p><p>The research team has received funding to develop the procedure for arm amputation as well, Carty added.</p><p>Ewing had his climbing accident in December 2014, and at first, the damage to his left ankle was the least of his worries. He had life-threatening injuries throughout his body that required emergency treatment.</p><p>However, the ankle failed to heal properly during two years of recovery, remaining painful and swollen, Ewing said. A CT scan revealed that most of the bone in the ankle had died.</p><p>\"It was not going to heal and recover,\" Ewing said. \"It was not likely I would ever regain use of the foot, so I opted to have it amputated.\"</p><p>Carty had been working with a team at MIT to create a robotic limb that would work in conjunction with the new transplant procedure his team had dreamed up. It just so happened that a friend of Ewing is a lead researcher at MIT, who put him in contact with Carty.</p><p><b>But special surgery not for every amputee</b></p><p>This sequence of events points out one drawback to the new procedure, said Dr. Ageliki Vouyouka, an associate professor of surgery and radiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.</p><p>The procedure uses tissue harvested from the amputated limb to create the new connections between muscle groups, Vouyouka noted. Given this, people who lose limbs damaged by gangrene, poor blood flow or other diseases that kill off tissue would likely not be good candidates for the Ewing Amputation.</p><p>But the new procedure is a \"very interesting development\" that is likely to become a new standard for amputation if further testing bears it out, said Vouyouka, who was not involved with the research.</p><p>\"Mostly I can see that happening for limbs lost to war trauma or civilian trauma,\" she said.</p><p>The new amputation procedure has provided other benefits on top of easier adaptation to his prosthetic foot, Ewing said.</p><p>\"The muscle definition is much stronger. There's much more tissue there. My leg hasn't atrophied away to skin and bones, which happens quite a lot with amputations,\" Ewing said. </p><p>\"The thinking is the residual limb is healthier because there's all this active muscle tissue there. You have improved circulation, more muscle tissue for padding and all of that,\" he said.</p><p>The study on Ewing's case was published recently in the online journal <i>PRS Global Open</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Mayo Clinic has more about <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/phantom-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20376272?p=1\" target=\"_new\">phantom pain</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 14, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Yoga has many benefits, from increasing flexibility to reducing stress.</p><p>The practice offers so much because of its multi-dimensional nature. In addition to its fluid exercises, called asanas or poses, it focuses on correct breathing, posture and meditation with a philosophy that strives for a balance of body, mind and spirit.</p><p>There are many styles of yoga offered in the United States, most of which are rooted in the classic hatha yoga.</p><p>Popular hatha yoga styles include: Ananda, Anusara, Ashtanga, Bikram,  Iyengar, Kripalu, Kundalini and Viniyoga.</p><p>Not every style is right for every <i>body</i>.</p><p>For instance Bikram, or \"hot yoga,\" is done in a room heated to 105 degrees Fahrenheit to encourage heavy sweating. This can raise your own body temperature well over 100 degrees F, and that's not safe for everyone. There's also been some criticism about not enough water breaks being offered during sessions at some studios. Because of its excessive heat exposure, Bikram yoga may not be appropriate for people with heart or lung disease, or who have experienced heatstroke in the past.</p><p>Fortunately, there are many other interesting styles to explore.</p><p>For instance, Iyengar (pronounced eye-n-gar) yoga incorporates props into poses and focuses on symmetry and body alignment. Viniyoga (pronounced vee-knee-yoga) is a very gentle style, often recommended for beginners and when yoga is used as a healing therapy. Sivananda (pronounced siva-nanda) also focuses on gentle movement along with an emphasis on deep relaxation.</p><p>At the other extreme, Kundalini (pronounced kun-doo-lini) is designed to release a flow of energy through breathing and chanting.</p><p>These are just a few of the options. Be sure to ask questions as you investigate yoga classes and studios so you know where the emphasis is placed and that your personal goals will be met.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The magazine <i>Yoga Journal</i> has an online tool to help you locate information on <a href=\"https://directory.yogajournal.com\" target=\"_new\">yoga teachers</a>, trained in various types of yoga, across the country.</p>",

In fact, it has disappeared from the spotlight in more recent years, as rates dipped after the 1990s and the opioid epidemic increasingly captured headlines.</p><p>However, inhalant abuse remains common: A U.S. survey found that in 2017, close to 9 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds had ever tried to get high from common products such as cleaners, spray paint, glue, felt-tip markers or lighter fluid.</p><p>\"Inhalant abuse has fallen off the radar a bit, but it's still common,\" said Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor, a medical toxicologist with the nonprofit National Capital Poison Center in Washington, D.C.</p><p>It's particularly appealing to kids because they can easily get their hands on household products, noted Johnson-Arbor, who was not involved in the new case report.</p><p>Beyond that, she said, kids may assume the seemingly benign products can't hurt them.</p><p>But this teenager's death illustrates just how misguided those perceptions are, Johnson-Arbor said.</p><p>The report, published Nov. 15 in the journal <i>BMJ Case Reports</i>, centers on a 19-year-old Dutch man who was in a rehab center for ketamine and marijuana abuse.</p><p>Without any drugs available, he reached for a personal care product -- spray deodorant -- in a quest to get high. He initially became hyper, \"jumping up and down,\" according to the report, before collapsing.</p><p>Nurses at the center performed basic life support, and when paramedics arrived they discovered the man was in cardiac arrest. That means the heart has stopped and is no longer pumping blood to the rest of the body. Paramedics used a portable defibrillator to try to \"shock\" his heart back into a normal rhythm, but could not revive him.</p><p>When the patient was taken to the hospital, doctors placed him in a medically induced coma. But when his condition failed to improve after more than a week, further treatment was deemed futile. He was taken off life support and died shortly after.</p><p>Like many aerosol products, spray deodorant typically contains butane as a gas propellant, according to Dr. Kelvin Harvey Kramp, one of the doctors on the case.</p><p>Butane and similar substances are readily absorbed into fat tissue, including nervous system tissue. That action can produce the \"high\" inhalant abusers are looking for -- but it can also have severe consequences for the heart and other vital organs, according to Kramp.</p><p>At this point, there have been many reports on inhalant-linked deaths, said Kramp, of Maastad Hospital in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.</p><p>But, he said, one hope with this report is to raise awareness that people in drug rehab may be especially vulnerable to this type of substance abuse.</p><p>Another, Kramp said, is to warn young people about the dangers of inhalants in general.</p><p>There are immediate risks other than cardiac arrest, Johnson-Arbor noted: For one, the intoxication can lead to serious or fatal accidents.</p><p>According to Kramp, some deaths have been blamed on suffocation, when victims used a plastic bag to inhale the chemical fumes.</p><p>Chronic inhalant abuse can also have lasting consequences, Johnson-Arbor said. Over time, it may damage the brain or peripheral nerves in the limbs, for example.</p><p>It can be tough for parents to spot inhalant abuse, according to Johnson-Arbor. Even if your child swipes your spray deodorant, she noted, he or she may simply be using it as intended.</p><p>That said, Johnson-Arbor pointed to some potential red flags parents can look for: a rash around the mouth where the chemical has irritated the skin; chemical smells from a child's clothes or breath; or large amounts of household products gone missing.</p><p>Johnson-Arbor suggested that parents try to head off any experimentation by talking to their kids about the dangers of huffing.</p><p>\"If you don't discuss this with them, they'll hear about it at school or at summer camp,\" she said. \"It's better to arm your child with knowledge.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse has more on <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/inhalants/what-are-inhalants\" target=\"_new\">inhalant abuse</a>.</p>",

According to wide-ranging research, garlic seems to improve immunity and heart health, help fight certain cancers, and lower triglycerides and total cholesterol.</p><p>Some of these benefits can be seen after eating just one meal with raw garlic. Yet overall there's enough evidence to have at least half a clove every day, researchers suggest.</p><p>Garlic is readily available and relatively inexpensive. Buy one whole head of garlic at a time -- the skin should be dry and papery and the visible bulbs should be firm and full, not shriveled.</p><p>To get the most benefits, chop, slice or crush fresh garlic to use it. This fires up a process that makes its compounds more potent. Wait 5 to 10 minutes before eating or adding to a dish, especially if you'll be mixing it with a highly acidic food like lemon juice.</p><p>Some easy ways to use minced raw garlic are to blend it into avocado, along with red onion, jalapeno and cilantro for guacamole; into chickpeas for hummus; or into cooked white beans for bean dip. Whisked into oil and vinegar with your choice of herbs, garlic adds zest to salad dressings and marinades.</p><p>But you don't have to always eat it raw. As long as the garlic is prepped as suggested and added toward the end of a recipe, it will retain its nutritional value when cooked.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about <a href=\"http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/food-beverages/garlic\" target=\"_new\">garlic</a> from the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University.</p>",

But the extent of the risk is not clear, researchers explained.</p><p>This study was prompted by evidence of Chagas in dogs working on the Mexican border.</p><p>The researchers tested blood samples from 1,660 federal government working dogs in 43 states and found that 121 dogs (more than 7 percent) had signs of an ongoing <i>T. cruzi</i> infection. Many of the infected dogs also had signs of Chagas-associated heart abnormalities that can be fatal.</p><p>The findings were presented Wednesday at the American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene annual meeting, in New Orleans.</p><p>\"We were surprised to find that so many dogs, including those working outside of the kissing bug range, had been exposed to the parasite <i>T. cruzi</i> and were exhibiting heart abnormalities associated with the disease,\" said study author Alyssa Meyers, a doctoral candidate at Texas A&amp;M University.</p><p>Meyers said the relatively high rate of Chagas infections in the dogs doesn't mean there's an increasing threat to people. </p><p>\"A positive dog usually signals that infected kissing bugs are in the environment,\" she noted in a society news release. \"But the risk to humans is likely not equal to dogs, in part because dogs have a tendency to eat bugs that could be infected with the parasite and dogs spend more time outdoors.</p><p>\"Not all dogs that are exposed to the parasite develop cardiac disease. Many can live a happy, healthy life,\" Meyers added. \"We are trying to understand why some dogs remain asymptomatic, while others develop Chagas cardiomyopathy. These dogs play a critical role in our country's security, and we want to make sure we are doing everything we can do to keep them healthy.\"</p><p>Kissing bugs can thrive in locations such as kennels. The dogs used by U.S. agencies train at facilities in Texas and Virginia, two states with known populations of kissing bugs that carry the Chagas parasite, and it's likely that some dogs were exposed while at these facilities, the study authors said.</p><p>\"From previous studies we knew that shelter and stray dogs were at risk for exposure, likely because of their time spent outdoors, and perhaps the dogs working along the U.S.-Mexico border who spend long hours outside often at night might be equally exposed,\" Meyers said.</p><p>\"We were not expecting infection in dogs that spend most of their time working along the border with Canada or in airports in Nebraska,\" she added.</p><p>Research presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until it has been published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/chagas/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Chagas disease</a>.</p>",

Those who posted a high number of images and selfies on social media had an average 25 percent increase in narcissistic traits such as exhibitionism, a sense of entitlement and exploitation of others.</p><p>This increase resulted in many of these people meeting the clinical definition of a narcissistic personality disorder, the British study authors said.</p><p>\"There have been suggestions of links between narcissism and the use of visual postings on social media, such as Facebook, but until this study it was not known if narcissists use this form of social media more, or whether using such platforms is associated with the subsequent growth in narcissism,\" said study leader Phil Reed, who's with the department of psychology at Swansea University.</p><p>\"The results of this study suggest that both occur, but show that posting selfies can increase narcissism,\" he said in a university news release.</p><p>But the study could not prove that posting lots of selfies is linked to narcissism.</p><p>Still, \"taking our sample as representative of the population, which there is no reason to doubt, this means that about 20 percent of people may be at risk of developing such narcissistic traits associated with their excessive visual social media use,\" Reed concluded.</p><p>Interestingly, his team also found that people who mainly posted written messages on social media did not have an increase in narcissism.</p><p>The study was published online recently in the <i>Open Psychology Journal</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Psychological Association has more on <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/02/narcissism.aspx\" target=\"_new\">narcissism</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 19, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Traffic-related air pollution may play a role in development of autism, new research suggests.</p><p>A Canadian study found that exposure to a common air pollutant during pregnancy was tied to higher odds of a child being diagnosed with autism by age 5.</p><p>That pollutant, nitric oxide, is associated with traffic pollution, the researchers noted.</p><p>\"There is no cure for autism spectrum disorder, so prevention has an important role to play,\" said lead researcher Lief Pagalan.</p><p>\"Avoiding air pollution is not easy because it's all around us, and we should see this as a broader public health issue,\" said Pagalan, of the faculty of health sciences at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver. \"In the long term, it's about bringing down air pollution levels for everyone.\"</p> <p>About one in 59 American children has some form of autism, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, and include difficulties with socialization and communication.</p><p>Scientists have begun to believe environmental factors play a role in its development, and research studies are zeroing in on air pollution.</p><p>This Canadian study looked at children born in Vancouver from 2004 through 2009. The researchers evaluated exposure to three common air pollutants: nitrogen dioxide; PM2.5 (tiny particles of combustion); and nitric oxide. They also took into account other factors such as child's sex, the month and year of birth, the mother's age and birthplace, city living, and income.</p><p>Only prenatal exposure to higher levels of nitric oxide appeared to increase odds for autism, Pagalan said. </p><p>Of more than 132,000 children whose records were examined, 1 percent were diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder by their 5th birthday.</p><p>The effect was modest -- just a 7 percent higher risk for every 11 parts per billion increase in nitric oxide, the study found.</p><p>Pagalan cautioned that this study cannot prove air pollution causes autism, only that they are associated. \"Our research did not focus on causal mechanisms, but instead on identifying environmental risk factors, which helps identify opportunities for prevention,\" he said.</p><p>Vancouver is a city known for low levels of air pollution, the researchers pointed out. </p><p>These findings do not mean that other types of air pollutants or combinations of pollution aren't potential triggers of autism. This is an area for further study, the study authors noted.</p><p>What causes autism isn't entirely clear. Research into possible environmental culprits is relatively recent, so scientists don't fully understand the links, Pagalan added.  </p><p>But the new study findings are consistent with those from studies done in the United States, Israel and Taiwan, he and his colleagues said.</p><p>\"Researchers have hypothesized that environmental exposures affect the immune or endocrine systems, or cause oxidative stress and inflammation,\" he said. \"This, in turn, may affect neurodevelopment.\" </p><p>In any case, the effects of air pollution on the risk for autism spectrum disorder, while apparent, are small, said Thomas Frazier, chief science officer at Autism Speaks, an autism advocacy organization in the United States.</p><p>\"Even for nitric oxide, the effects are very small,\" Frazier said. \"This may be due to the still relatively crude measurement of exposure, since we don't have actual biological exposure data for each child.\"</p><p>Whether reducing exposure to nitric oxide will decrease the likelihood of autism spectrum disorder needs to be studied, Frazier said. </p><p>The report was published online Nov. 19 in <i>JAMA Pediatrics</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>For more on autism spectrum disorders, visit the <a href=\" https://www.hhs.gov/programs/topic-sites/autism/index.html \" target=\"_new\"> U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 31, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The science of spinal cord stimulation has been fine-tuned to the point that three previously paralyzed patients can now walk with minimal assistance, Swiss researchers report.</p><p>They can do so with only the aid of crutches or a walker, thanks to incredibly precise electrical stimulation of their spinal cord combined with intensive rehabilitation, the scientists said.</p><p>In fact, two of the patients can take several steps without electrical stimulation, a sign that there's been growth of new nerve connections, said senior researcher Gregoire Courtine, chair of spinal cord repair at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne.</p><p>\"Walking hands-free really felt more or less like walking normally, and that was a very big achievement,\" said 28-year-old patient David M., who became paralyzed after a sports accident in 2010 left him with no control of his left leg and only residual control of his right.</p><p>Previous studies have revealed that \"the spinal cord has its own intelligence system that controls walking,\" said Dr. Thomas Oxley, director of innovation strategy for the Mount Sinai Health System Department of Neurology in New York City.</p><p>\"If you think about cutting the head off a chicken, it can still walk around. It doesn't need the brain to walk,\" Oxley said.</p><p>Implanted electrodes that provide direct electrical stimulation to the spinal cord have been shown to allow movement of previously paralyzed legs.</p><p>For example, last month the Mayo Clinic reported on the case of a 29-year-old paraplegic who now can walk about the length of a football field with assistance.</p><p>The new study takes the medicine and technology of spinal stimulation even further in two ways.</p><p>First, patients were implanted with an array of electrodes down the spinal cord, which allowed researchers to target individual muscle groups in the legs.</p><p>\"Specific configurations of electrodes are activated to control the appropriate groups of muscles, mimicking the signals that the brain would deliver to produce walking,\" explained co-researcher Dr. Jocelyne Bloch, a neurosurgeon with Lausanne University Hospital. Bloch compared the targeted stimulation to the precision of a Swiss watch.</p><p>Second, and even more important, the research team fine-tuned the stimulation to work in conjunction with the patients' proprioceptive sensory system.</p><p>Proprioception is your ability to know the exact position of your legs at all times, allowing you to precisely coordinate their movements, Oxley explained.</p><p>\"When you close your eyes, you know where your leg is, without having to look at it,\" Oxley said. \"There's a complex network of information coming back into the spinal cord from the leg about where your leg is in space.\"</p><p>Continuous nerve stimulation overloads a person's proprioceptive system, researchers discovered.</p><p>\"If you stimulate the entire spinal cord, you will activate all the muscles at the same time and block leg movement,\" Courtine said.</p><p>When the stimulation was fed in pulses that worked in conjunction with the proprioceptive system, patients achieved remarkable improvement in their ability to move previously paralyzed legs in coordination, the researchers said.</p><p>All three study participants were able to walk with body-weight support after only one week spent calibrating the nerve stimulation to their individual brain patterns, Courtine said.</p><p>\"They figured out how to deliver these pulses of stimulation into the spinal cord at the right pace, at the right beat, that would not disrupt that proprioceptive sensory system,\" Oxley said.</p><p>Long, high-intensity training sessions appear to have triggered the nervous system's ability to reorganize nerve pathways around damaged nerves, researchers said. As a result, patients have improved motor function even when the electrical stimulation has been turned off.</p><p>Another patient, Sebastian Tobler, said he can now walk a few steps hands-free in the lab with the aid of electrical stimulation. He can even trike uphill outdoors, using a special three-wheeled cycle that uses both hand- and leg-operated cranks.</p><p>\"I can support more and more weight on my legs and have more and more control with my legs,\" said Tobler, 47, who had both legs completely paralyzed after a 2013 mountain biking accident.</p><p>The patients were given watches that adapt the electrical stimulation to their needs based on voice commands.</p><p>But none of the researchers would say that a full cure for paralysis is on its way, based on this research.</p><p>\"I hope we can develop some kind of walker or exoskeleton combined with stimulation so we can get people out of the wheelchair,\" Courtine said. \"They might not walk around, but they will feel better and will have a lot of health benefits associated with this mobilization of their body.\"</p><p>The advance offered by this study is a \"real breakthrough\" in terms of restoring mobility to some paralyzed patients, even though they likely won't achieve fully independent walking, Oxley said.</p><p>\"Cure is a very strong word, and this is not a cure,\" Oxley said. \"This is the first possible treatment that can potentially change the course of rehabilitation outcome in terms of walking.\"</p><p>The findings were published Nov. 1 in the journals <i>Nature</i> and <i>Nature Neuroscience</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation has more about <a href=\"https://www.christopherreeve.org/living-with-paralysis/rehabilitation/functional-electrical-stimulation\" target=\"_new\">functional electrical stimulation</a>.</p>",

She is a pediatric emergency medicine fellow at Emory University in Atlanta. </p><p>But since so many burns are caused by microwavable instant soup and noodles, \"any school-age child consuming these products needs to be adequately supervised,\" she said. </p><p>Dr. Michael Cooper, director of Staten Island University Hospital's burn center in New York City, said the study mirrors what he often sees in practice. </p><p>\"We do see instant soup and noodle burns with kids in this age group,\" he said. </p><p>The good news is that most of the children were treated in the emergency room and then sent home, Cooper noted. Most didn't have to stay in the hospital, and would likely heal in two weeks or less. </p><p>\"These burns are painful, but most appear to be superficial,\" he explained. </p><p>Cooper said the scenario he often sees is that the parent has heated the prepackaged container of soup, and given it to the child. While eating, the child knocks it over and gets burned. </p><p>A simple solution might be taking the noodles or soup from the original container and transferring them to a bowl the child is accustomed to using, Cooper suggested. A bowl probably isn't as tall as some of the instant-food containers. </p><p>For the study, the researchers reviewed data from the U.S. National Electronic Injury Surveillance System  from 2006 to 2016. They looked for kids aged 4 to 12 with scald burns caused by microwavable instant soup, instant noodles, cups of soup, or water for making instant soup. </p><p>Scald burns associated with instant soups and noodles affected more than 9,500 children each year, the findings showed. The average age of a child with such a burn was 7 years old. </p><p>The most commonly burned site was the child's torso -- about 40 percent of burns occurred here. </p><p>Allen said the database didn't specify whether kids had cooked the foods in the microwave themselves, or if parents or another caregiver had done so. </p><p>She added that injuries may occur when someone grabs a hot container from the microwave and flinches because it's so hot, spilling it on themselves. </p><p>Allen also noted that instant noodles absorb the liquid during cooking. So if a child drops a container of noodles, the hot food may stick to the body. </p><p>Cooper said the study shows a need for more education of parents, grandparents and other caregivers. \"People need to be more aware that these burns can happen,\" he said. </p><p>The study is scheduled for presentation Monday at an American Academy of Pediatrics meeting, in Orlando. Research presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about preventing burns in kids from <a href=\"https://www.safekids.org/tip/burns-and-scalds-prevention-tips\" target=\"_new\">Safe Kids Worldwide</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 9, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Sudden cardiac arrest -- when the heart stops beating -- is one of the leading causes of death in the U.S. To help save lives, automated external defibrillators, which shock the heart back into a regular beat, have been placed in many public places. </p> <p>Now, these portable AED devices may improve the chance of survival among children and teens, according to a new study presented Sunday at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions meeting in Chicago.</p> <p>The researchers analyzed statistics in a national database on 971 cardiac arrests in children ages 18 and under that occurred outside a hospital between January 2013 and December 2017. An AED was used 10.3 percent of the time, but rates varied across age groups. For infants, defibrillators were used to help 2.3 percent. But AED use became more common as children got older: 8.3 percent among kids ages 2 to 5; 12.4 percent among those 6 to 11; and 18.2 percent among 12- to 18-year-olds.</p> <p>Older kids may be more likely to have a bystander use a defibrillator because they may be more likely to go into cardiac arrest in a place, such as a school, that has an AED, said the study's lead researcher Dr. Heather Griffis, director of the Healthcare Analytics Unit at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.</p> <p>Bystanders might also be afraid to use a defibrillator on infants and preschool-age children out of fear of injuring them, said the study's senior researcher Dr. Joe Rossano, a pediatric cardiologist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.</p> <p>\"If a child has an arrest, it's a scary thing,\" Rossano said. \"People don't want to do something wrong. But anything you do is going to be helpful.\"</p> <p>Children treated with an AED by a bystander had a survival rate of 29.1 percent, compared to 23.7 percent for children who were not. The rates varied by age and race, with children who were 12 to 18 years old or white having better outcomes than younger children or those who were black or Hispanic. Griffis said similar racial differences also are seen in adults.</p> <p>\"It's unfortunate that we're still seeing these disparities across race, ethnicity and neighborhoods,\" Griffis said. \"But this is a great opportunity for education and to increase availability\" of AEDs in neighborhoods that don't yet have them.</p> <p>More than 350,000 Americans -- including about 7,000 children --  experience cardiac arrests outside of the hospital each year. AEDs come with step-by-step instructions that make it possible for people without specialized training to use them.</p> <p>Dr. Alson Inaba directs pediatric advanced life support classes at Queen's Medical Center in Honolulu and said the study added important new information on the use of AEDs in children. </p> <p>Inaba, who was not involved in the research, said that bystanders should start CPR on a cardiac arrest victim of any age after calling 911.</p> <p>\"The bottom line is that starting CPR immediately is your first priority,\" Inaba said. \"Don't be afraid.\"</p> <p>Then, send someone to get a defibrillator. \"When you combine CPR with an AED, the survival rates increase,\" he said.</p> <p>Indeed, a separate study published earlier this year in the AHA journal <i>Circulation</i> found that survival rates doubled when bystanders used a defibrillator to help an adult who had experienced cardiac arrest before emergency responders arrived.</p> <p>\"Defibrillators work,\" Rossano said. \"It's something anybody can do, and the more that are available, the more opportunities there are to save lives.\"</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 31, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- For weeks, Donna Greene got the brush-off when she asked the pharmacist about getting her second dose of Shingrix, the sought-after but scarce new shingles vaccine.</p><p>Check back next week. Check in two weeks. We just don't know, she was told at last. Finally, in mid-October, Greene got lucky.</p><p>\"My husband's friend &hellip; said he wasn't feeling well because he had had the shingles shot and his flu shot on the same day, and I said, 'Really? Wait. It's in?' \" said Greene, 67, a retired county government spokeswoman in Greenburgh, N.Y. \"I went in the next day.\"</p><p>For the over-50 set, Shingrix can be harder to come by than a ticket to \"Hamilton\" or a Paul McCartney concert. For months, demand for the vaccine, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 2017, has outpaced supply, frustrating patients and providers alike. </p><p>\"It's like a blue-light special at Kmart -- people are calling and looking for that vaccine,\" said Heather Free, a spokeswoman for the American Pharmacists Association. \"But I don't anticipate that this is going to be an issue much longer.\"</p><p>A spokesman for the British drug giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), maker of Shingrix, underscored that view.</p><p>\"We are shipping a large volume of vaccine this week,\" said GSK vaccines spokesman Sean Clements.</p><p>\"We understand that this is a challenging situation to manage and GSK is fully committed to expediting resupply throughout 2018,\" he added.</p><p><b>Better protection</b></p><p>The unprecedented demand came after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention designated Shingrix as the preferred shingles vaccine. The CDC recommends two doses, two to six months apart, for adults age 50 and over -- even if a patient previously received Merck's Zostavax, a live shingles vaccine used since 2006.</p><p>Anyone who has had chicken pox -- 99 percent of Americans over age 40, the CDC estimates -- is at risk for shingles, also known as herpes zoster. That's because both conditions are caused by the varicella zoster virus, which stays inside the body, where it can reactivate years later. </p><p>Shingles causes a painful, blistering rash that can leave lasting and debilitating nerve pain in its wake. It can also lead to pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness, encephalitis and death. The risk increases with age.</p><p>Zostavax reduces shingles risk by 51 percent, while clinical trials found Shingrix to be more than 90 percent effective, according to the CDC.</p><p>\"A friend got shingles after that earlier shot so we were already alerted to the fact that it was ineffective,\" Greene said. \"I don't think it was as bad a case, but she was saying, 'You don't ever want to get this disease.' \"</p><p>That kind of buzz, along with early advertising, fueled the ongoing squeeze on Shingrix supplies. </p><p>The supply is especially tight in areas with large populations of older people, Free said.</p><p>One of those is North Carolina, where a Raleigh Walgreens' had a four-page waitlist by mid-October. A supermarket pharmacy on the Oregon coast, meanwhile, got a small shipment of Shingrix that was gone within days. \"It doesn't last when we get it in, and we never know when more is coming,\" said the pharmacist, who would not give her name because she was not authorized to speak for the chain.</p><p><b>'Don't give up'</b></p><p>So what's a consumer to do?</p><p>GSK has an online tool patients can use to find pharmacies and providers who have offered the vaccine. Though Clements said it's updated regularly, he suggests double-checking with providers, because supplies are sometimes depleted faster than the site reflects.</p><p>You can also ask your provider to put you on a waitlist. Not all are keeping them, but it can't hurt to ask. Some pharmacies, especially smaller, independent ones, also have voice messages with daily updates.</p><p>Also, if you've had your first dose of Shingrix, don't worry if the six-month window closes before you get the second shot. You have some protection against shingles, and you won't have to start from scratch.</p><p>Meanwhile, providing a written record of the first shot may help you move to the front of the line if you find a different provider with Shingrix in stock.</p><p>\"Don't give up, continue searching for it, but don't let it be the first priority in your life,\" Free said. \"We'll be able to get more soon.\"</p><p>If you've never had a shingles shot and Shingrix is unavailable, but you want immediate vaccination, you can always get the Zostavax vaccine. The CDC says it may still be used in healthy adults aged 60 years and older, and it won't prevent you from getting Shingrix later. It's also an alternative if a person is allergic to Shingrix.</p><p>Through June, more than 3 million doses of Shingrix had been administered in the United States, according to GSK. \"We expect to vaccinate significantly more patients against shingles this year than were vaccinated in total in 2017,\" Clements said.</p><p>He said GSK plans to share more information about the supply outlook for 2019 on Wednesday.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>GlaxoSmithKline, manufacturer of Shingrix, has an online <a href=\"https://www.shingrix.com/shingles-vaccine-locator.html\" target=\"_new\">vaccine locator</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 31, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- You're less likely to pick up a nasty infection during a hospital stay in the United States than you were just a few years ago, a new report finds. </p><p>Between 2011 and 2015, a patient's risk of catching a hospital-acquired infection dropped 16 percent, researchers said. </p><p>\"The findings are encouraging. Progress is being made in infections affecting hospitals in the United States. But more work needs to be done,\" said the study's lead author, Dr. Shelley Magill, a medical officer with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p><p>Health care-associated infections are a significant threat to patient safety. The study authors estimated that in 2011, about 648,000 patients had at least one health-care associated infection in the United States. </p><p>Pneumonia was the most common infection, followed by digestive infections and surgical site infections, the study found. </p><p>Most of the digestive infections were caused by <i>Clostridioides difficile</i>.  These <i>C. difficile</i> infections are typically related to antibiotic use, and can be deadly. Magill said these infections didn't show a decline. </p><p>Working with 10 state health departments, the researchers recruited up to 25 hospitals in each state to participate in the study. Each participating hospital chose one day during a specified time period to record how many patients had infections. </p><p>In 2011, 183 hospitals participated. In 2015, 199 hospitals were included. </p><p>Four percent of hospital patients had a health care-associated infection in 2011. By 2015, that number had dropped to 3.2 percent. </p><p>The biggest declines were seen in surgical site infections and urinary tract infections, according to the study. </p><p>Magill said fewer people had urinary catheters in 2015. Also, she said, there was a focus on getting those catheters out of patients as soon as possible to reduce infection risk. </p><p>The types of surgical site infection vary, but Magill said specific efforts to reduce these infections appear to be paying off. However, the new study didn't collect information on the specific practices hospitals were taking. </p><p>Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said this was a very well-done study that captures data from a lot of hospitals. </p><p>\"We've been making progress against health care-associated infections, and it's hard to move the needle on a national level. But progress is still slow. These findings shouldn't make us complacent. We have a lot of work ahead still,\" said Jha, who wasn't involved with the study. </p><p>What can patients do to protect themselves? </p><p>One of the most important steps in infection prevention is remarkably simple -- frequent, thorough hand-washing. Jha said if you haven't seen a doctor or nurse washing their hands before they exam you, it's fine to ask. </p><p>\"There's nothing wrong with making sure people are doing what they're supposed to be doing,\" he said. </p><p>Also, if you notice any change in the way you're feeling, let someone on your health care team know about the change, because it may signal a developing infection. </p><p>\"Be vigilant in the hospital if new symptoms develop,\" Jha said. </p><p>Magill agreed that hand-washing is \"absolutely essential.\" </p><p><i>C. difficile</i> infections remain a challenge, Magill and Jha said. And Magill said the rates of pneumonia are also concerning. </p><p>The study results were published Nov. 1 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn what you can do to stay safe during hospitalizations from the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hai/patientsafety/patient-safety.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 1, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Look after your heart to be kind to the mind. That's the primary message emerging from research into Alzheimer's, a disease of the brain that appears to be deeply driven by what happens to the heart and blood vessels. </p> <p>The link between high blood pressure and Alzheimer's disease has been a particular focus of recent studies. </p> <p>\"High blood pressure, uncontrolled, causes damage to virtually every organ system,\" said Jeff Keller, director of the Institute for Dementia Research and Prevention at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. \"It shouldn't be surprising that the brain, the most vascularized and energy-dependent organ of the body, is greatly the most damaged by fluctuations in blood pressure control.\"</p> <p>Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia and is the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States. About 5.7 million Americans have been diagnosed with the disease, including 200,000 people under the age of 65. Those numbers are expected to skyrocket as more Baby Boomers reach retirement age and beyond.</p> <p>At the annual Alzheimer's Association meeting in July, researchers presented preliminary findings from a study that looked at the impact of aggressively reducing high blood pressure to currently recommended levels. It found the effort decreased the risk of developing mild cognitive impairment, a common precursor to dementia.</p> <p>In August, a study in the journal <i>Neurology</i> found older people with higher blood pressure were more likely to have brain lesions -- areas of dead tissue -- caused by low blood supply. Researchers also found these patients had more \"tangles,\" or twisted strands of protein that are considered common markers of Alzheimer's.</p> <p>Blood pressure levels have been in the spotlight the past year after new guidelines issued last November by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association redefined high blood pressure as 130/80 versus the previous 140/90.</p> <p>According to AHA statistics, about 103 million American adults, or roughly 46 percent of the nation's adult population, now qualify as having high blood pressure. But about 16 percent of them don't know they have the condition. </p> <p>High blood pressure can be reduced through lifestyle changes, such as reducing sodium [salt] in the diet and exercising, as well as medication. </p> <p>\"Think of it as a cocktail that should include a good diet, some exercise and, if needed, some medication,\" she said. \"There's no magic pill. It's a lot of work. But what's good for the heart really is good for the brain. It's that simple.\"</p> <p>The Alzheimer's Association this year is launching the U.S. Study to Protect Brain Health Through Lifestyle Intervention to Reduce Risk, a clinical trial that includes an exercise regimen, nutritional guidance, and cognitive and social stimulation. The organization has a tool on its website to help match visitors to hundreds of clinical trials across the country. </p> <p>Keller's institution is one of several overseeing research that specifically examines the impact of blood pressure reduction on reducing Alzheimer's risk among people who have a family history or significant memory concerns. In addition to blood pressure control, the Risk Reduction for Alzheimer's Disease trial also is examining the impact of exercise and cholesterol management.</p> <p>\"Hypertension [high blood pressure] is rarely seen in isolation. It's usually associated with other risk factors or chronic conditions, like obesity,\" Keller said. \"What we're doing is trying to decrease as many vascular factors as we can.\"</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Nov.1, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The first Food and Drug Administration-approved drug containing an ingredient derived from the marijuana plant went on sale Thursday in the United States.</p><p>Epidiolex is a twice-daily oral solution -- a cannabidiol, or CBD liquid -- made by Britain-based GW Pharmaceuticals. It is approved for use in patients 2 years old and older with two types of epileptic syndromes, Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.</p><p>\"Because these patients have historically not responded well to available seizure medications, there has been a dire need for new therapies that aim to reduce the frequency and impact of seizures,\" Justin Gover, CEO of GW Pharmaceuticals, said in a written statement.</p><p>The FDA approved Epidiolex in June. CBD is derived from the cannabis plant but it does not create any \"high\" in users. CBD oils and other CBD products have become popular across the United States in recent years, for the treatment of pain and other issues.</p><p>This was the first time the FDA approved such a product for any medicinal use, however. In a statement, agency Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said regulatory approval and oversight is important to safeguard patients.</p><p>\"Because of the adequate and well-controlled clinical studies that supported this approval, prescribers can have confidence in the drug's uniform strength and consistent delivery,\" he explained.</p><p>An FDA advisory panel unanimously recommended in April that Epidiolex be approved for use in the United States.</p><p><b>Low doses proved effective</b></p><p>Although CBD oil has become a trendy cure-all, treatment of epilepsy is the only use that has garnered significant scientific evidence supporting its usefulness.</p><p>Epidiolex made headlines in May when a clinical trial found that even low doses of the drug could help patients with epilepsy.</p><p>In the trial, patients taking a 10-milligram (mg) daily dose of pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol experienced nearly as great a reduction in seizures as patients on 20 mg, and with fewer side effects, said the lead researcher of that study, Dr. Orrin Devinsky. He directs NYU Langone's Comprehensive Epilepsy Center in New York City.</p><p>This was the third clinical trial to show that Epidiolex is useful in treating two rare forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, Devinsky said.</p><p> GW Pharmaceuticals funded the clinical trial. It compared two different doses of Epidiolex head-to-head and against an inactive placebo, Devinsky said.</p><p>A total of 225 patients suffering from Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were divided into three groups. Those taking 20 mg of Epidiolex a day had 42 percent fewer seizures, on average, compared with 37 percent fewer seizures in the group taking 10 mg of the drug, and a 17 percent reduction in the placebo group.</p><p><b>Bigger dose not necessarily better</b></p><p>But while the 20-mg dose was slightly more effective, it was not the first choice of parents, Devinsky said.</p><p>\"When parents were asked to rate how their children did best, they actually had a slight preference for the 10-mg dose without knowing what it was,\" he added.</p><p>That's because these children did not experience as many side effects from the cannabidiol, which can include tiredness, decreased appetite, diarrhea and signs of possible liver damage, Devinsky explained.</p><p>\"They got the vast majority of the benefits with fewer of the side effects,\" he said.</p><p>The study also showed that Epidiolex is a safe treatment, with only seven patients dropping out of the trial due to side effects -- six from the 20-mg group and one from the 10-mg group.</p><p>\"Compared to other drugs used to treat epilepsy, I think Epidiolex, which is 99-percent pure cannabidiol, has a better side-effect profile than many of the available drugs,\" Devinsky said.</p><p>Still, the FDA noted in its approval statement that side effects could occur, such as sleepiness, lethargy, poor appetite and infections, among others. And like other drugs that treat epilepsy, Epidiolex will come with a special warning that use may be tied to a higher odds of depression, aggression and suicidal thoughts.</p><p><b>Best for severe cases</b></p><p>According to Dr. Angel Hernandez, of the Helen DeVos Children's Hospital in Grand Rapids, Mich., these results prove that pharmaceutical-grade CBD helps suppress seizures and \"increases our options to treat many of these patients with very, very difficult-to-control epilepsies.\" Hernandez is division chief of neuroscience at the hospital. </p><p>\"We're talking about types of epilepsy that are extremely difficult to treat with medication,\" he said. \"Most of these children and adults do not respond to normal pharmacological treatment.\"</p><p>No one is exactly sure why CBD has this beneficial effect, both Devinsky and Hernandez said. It appears to work on receptors that alter brain chemistry in a way that reduces the chances of a seizure.</p><p>The doctors noted that these effects were seen in patients taking a highly refined form of CBD produced by a drug maker. It's not known whether patients in states where medical marijuana is legal would see the same effects in CBD oil produced by small companies with no federal oversight.</p><p>It's also not clear whether CBD would help people with more common forms of epilepsy. Devinsky said small clinical trials have so far found no benefit in people with focal epilepsy, where seizures start on one side of the brain.</p><p>\"I think we need more studies,\" Devinsky said. \"It's not been investigated in generalized epilepsy, and I think we need a larger study in focal epilepsy.\"</p><p>The Epidioloex study findings were published online May 17 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Epilepsy Foundation has more about <a href=\"https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/treating-seizures-and-epilepsy/other-treatment-approaches/medical-marijuana-and-epilepsy\" target=\"_new\">medical marijuana and epilepsy</a>.</p>",

Ride-share vehicles typically don't come with a car seat, and an option to request one is available only in some cities, the study authors said.</p><p>Parents can provide their own car seat, but many are bulky, heavy and require a separate base, posing challenges during vacations or extended travel, according to the researchers.</p><p>The investigators found that 34 states exempt taxis and for-hire vehicles from child restraint requirements, but it's often unclear if these exemptions also apply to ride-share vehicles.</p><p>Currently, Georgia is the only state that distinguishes between ride-sharing and other for-hire vehicles. In that state, for-hire vehicles are exempt but ride-share drivers are required to provide car seats if needed, the findings showed.</p><p>The researchers also surveyed parents and found that more than one-third use ride-share services with their children, and up to half reported not providing appropriate child safety seats while riding in a ride-share vehicle with their families.</p><p>Overall, parents were interested in using child safety seats in ride-shares, but often felt stymied by the lack of car seat options and uncertainty about the rules.</p><p>Focus groups with ride-share drivers found that of the three-quarters who'd given rides to young children, only half recalled using a car seat.</p><p>\"These findings suggest that parents would like to be able to transport their children more safely when using ride-share vehicles, but there is a real need for user-friendly information about rules, regulations and resources surrounding travel with children,\" said the study's principal investigator Justin Owens. He is a research scientist at Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, in Blacksburg, Va.</p><p>\"For that reason, we have created a website (www.kidsridesafe.org) that aims to provide caregivers and ride-share drivers with this information in an easy-to-access manner,\" Owens added in a university news release.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on the value of car seats for children, visit the <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/on-the-go/Pages/Car-Safety-Seats-Information-for-Families.aspx\" target=\"_new\">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 29, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Growing up, Alanna Gardner learned she couldn't be too active. If she was, she would faint.</p> <p>Sometimes the spells prompted an emergency room visit. Doctors, however, never diagnosed the cause.</p> <p>Reluctantly, she gave up participating in sports.</p> <p>But after going away to college, Alanna started to wonder if the fainting was a signal that she simply wasn't in shape. She began exercising -- slowly at first. She maintained a healthy diet. And she had no more mysterious episodes.</p> <p>At 25, she trusted her body enough to sign up for Philadelphia's 10-mile Broad Street Run. Her training plan called for her to run a 10K event a few weeks before.</p> <p>Alanna considered herself to be in the best shape of her life. So when fatigue hit during the event, she felt \"defeated.\" And soon she was. As she crossed the finish line, she fainted for the first time in seven years.</p> <p>\"I couldn't find my friend or an ambulance, but I wasn't worried because it was such a normal thing,\" she said. \"So I just sat down figuring someone would find me.\"</p> <p>The next thing she remembers is waking up in the hospital.</p> <p>Alanna had experienced a major heart attack that caused her to go into cardiac arrest. In other words, not only did she have a problem with her heart's plumbing (a blocked artery that limited blood flow), this caused the heart's electrical power to go out.</p> <p>Luckily, two race participants who were nurses saw her in distress and immediately began CPR. At the hospital, doctors performed a procedure in which they opened the artery using a stent. She was placed in an induced coma for three days to help her body recover from all the trauma.</p> <p>Additional testing at the hospital revealed she had an anomalous or \"misplaced\" left coronary artery. In this congenital heart defect, the left coronary artery begins carrying oxygen-rich blood from the pulmonary artery instead of from the aorta. As a result, the heart doesn't get enough blood and oxygen.</p> <p>When Alanna exerted herself, her defective artery became pinched as it worked to supply enough blood. As a child, that pinch would relax as soon as she fainted, and the blood supply would be restored, reviving her. But when she fainted after the race, the pinch didn't release. This caused a blockage and fluid flowing back into her heart.</p> <p>A few weeks later, Alanna underwent open-heart bypass surgery.</p> <p>After learning her condition could have a genetic link, Alanna heard from several members of her family on her dad's side that they too had congenital heart defects.</p> <p>\"No one had ever talked about it before because no one associated fainting with a heart issue,\" she said. \"Had we known more about our family's history, we may have been able to make better use of our health care appointments and push for more answers.\"</p> <p>While Alanna couldn't change the fact that she had a heart defect, doctors said her good overall health played a role in her recovery.</p> <p>Alanna's commitment to a heart-healthy diet and plenty of exercise helped inspire her mom, Yolanda, to take a harder look at lifestyle changes she could make.</p> <p>After Alanna's heart attack, Yolanda was diagnosed with high blood pressure. Combined with a family history of heart disease and diabetes, Yolanda decided to change her diet to cut out sweets, fatty foods and red meat. She also changed some long-held family recipes to make them healthier.</p> <p>Yolanda, 64, also changed her approach toward health care visits, being more proactive and getting a second opinion if she doesn't feel her questions are being answered.</p> <p>\"I come in armed with questions and research,\" she said. \"It's a patient's responsibility to participate and not just go along for the ride. It's up to each of us to take care of our own health and make a commitment to changes.\"</p> <p>Now 32, Alanna works as a therapist and a fitness instructor in Philadelphia.</p> <p>\"Having the heart attack at that age is extremely traumatic and it definitely rocked my identity, but so many positive things came out of it,\" she said. \"I was able to reignite my passion for teaching people about fitness and health. I'm giving my students a way to see life's challenges as something you can grow from.\"</p>",

One group of participants was told that their eligibility to take part in the survey didn't depend on whether or not they'd had a flu shot. This was the control group.</p><p>But other groups were offered $5, $10 or $20 for taking part in the survey and were told they were eligible only if they had or had not received a recent flu shot.</p><p>In the control group, 52 percent of respondents said they'd had a recent flu shot. But among those who were told that their survey eligibility depended on recent flu vaccination and received payments of $5, $10 or $20, rates of participants who said they'd had a flu shot were 63.1 percent, 62.8 percent and 62.1 percent, respectively.</p><p>Rates among those who were told that their eligibility depended on having not received a recent flu vaccination were 46.5 percent at $5, 41.8 percent at $10, and 46.7 percent at $20.</p><p>The only differences between the groups in the study were their eligibility criteria and payment amounts, so the differences in their self-reported vaccination rates were due to lying, the University of Pennsylvania researchers said.</p><p>They calculated that between 10.5 and nearly 23 percent of participants lied about their eligibility to participate.</p><p>\"This type of behavior not only undermines a study's integrity and its results, but in a study with eligibility criteria that are intended to protect participants, it also has the potential to put participants at risk,\" first author Holly Fernandez Lynch said in a university news release. She is an assistant professor of medical ethics and health policy at the Perelman School of Medicine.</p><p>Payment is often used to get people to enroll in studies, but there has been little research on whether and to what extent people will lie about their eligibility or other aspects of participation to get paid.</p><p>\"Rather than relying on self-reporting by participants, investigators should use objective metrics whenever possible,\" said study senior author Emily Largent, an assistant professor of medical ethics and health policy.</p><p>\"The best response to our findings is not necessarily to reduce or eliminate payment offers for participation. Payment can help boost legitimate enrollment; in addition, investigators may owe payment as compensation for the time, effort, and burden that participants assume by joining the study,\" she added.</p><p>The researchers did note that the rates of lying seemed unconnected to the amount of payment offered.</p><p>\"This suggests that keeping payments low will not necessarily prevent deception,\" said study co-author Dr. Steven Joffe, chief of the Medical Ethics division. \"It also suggests that higher payments may encourage recruitment without posing a greater risk to the study's integrity.\"</p><p>The findings were published recently in <i>JAMA Network Open</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institutes of Health has more on <a href=\"https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2015/03/be-partner-clinical-research\" target=\"_new\">taking part in clinical research</a>.</p>",

But now, Canadian researchers say it may become unnecessary in women aged 55 or older who have one negative result with the test.</p><p>The DNA-based HPV test is highly accurate in detecting 14 high-risk strains of the virus that causes the majority of cervical cancers.</p><p>In the new study, researchers first gathered data on more than 200,000 women living in British Columbia. They then created a mathematical model that estimated the lifetime risk of cervical cancer in older women, all of who had not been vaccinated against HPV.</p><p>The result: Just one negative HPV DNA test at the age of 55 suggested that a woman has a very low risk (less than 1 percent) of cervical cancer, and continued screening with this type of test would provide little benefit, according to the study.</p><p>However, the researchers said that regular screening with the traditional -- and cheaper -- Pap test up to age 75 may still prevent some cervical cancers. But even in that case, benefits would decline with age.</p><p>\"Our results suggest that for countries that use HPV testing as part of their screening, it might be possible to stop screening earlier than we are currently doing, provided women have a negative HPV test,\" said study author Talia Malagon, of McGill University in Montreal.</p><p>But one obstetrician/gynecologist said it's too soon to make firm recommendations.</p><p>\"I caution readers to use this data as a reason to stop performing cervical cancer screening after age 55,\" said Dr. Adi Davidov, who directs Ob/Gyn care at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City.</p><p>\"Firstly, this study uses mathematical modeling, which may not be accurate,\" he said. \"In addition, many patients are already skipping their annual gynecology visit because of newer recommendations of less frequent cervical cancer screening. If women stop seeing their gynecologist at age 55, I worry that other serious conditions will be left undiagnosed.\"</p><p>The new findings were published Nov. 1 in <i>The Lancet Oncology</i> journal.</p><p>Right now, most guidelines say cervical cancer screening -- done with either with the Pap test or HPV DNA test -- can be stopped after ages 65 to 69.  However, there's been a lack of high-quality evidence to support this recommendation, the researchers said.</p> <p>\"Cervical cancers are caused by infections with oncogenic [cancer-causing] HPV types,\" Malagon explained in a journal news release. For decades, doctors have turned to the Pap test \"to detect the precancerous lesions caused by HPV, which can then be treated before they ever progress to cervical cancer,\" she added.</p><p>The Pap test has saved thousands of lives, but \"it is far from perfect because it does not always detect the precancerous lesions which develop into cancer,\" Malagon said.</p><p>\"We have known for some time that directly screening instead for the HPV types that cause cervical cancer performs just as well, if not better, than [the Pap test] for screening in women below the age of 60,\" she said.</p><p>What hasn't been known is whether an older woman who tests negative on an HPV screen can safely stop screening, as happens for some older women whose Pap tests come back negative.</p><p>The new study might help clear up that question, Malagon said.</p><p>She cautioned that the study \"does not necessarily suggest that all screening should stop at age 55, since the benefits of continued screening depend on the type of screening used. For countries that still use [Pap test] screening, screening at older ages should further reduce the risk of cervical cancer,\" she noted.</p><p>Furthermore, \"our study did not include any cost-effectiveness analysis, which will be a useful next step to inform policy decisions before any change in guidance is considered,\" Malagon said.</p><p>Dr. Jill Rabin helps direct Women's Health Programs at Northwell Health in New Hyde Park, N.Y. She called the findings \"interesting,\" but offered several caveats.</p><p>She said factors that might cause \"latent\" HPV to go undetected -- things like stress or certain medical conditions -- might be in play for some older women, rendering continued HPV screening valuable.</p>  <p>Furthermore, one rare but potentially deadly form of cervical cancer, called adenocarcinoma of the cervix, does not rely on HPV and \"most likely will go undetected until its later stages if a regular routine examination is not performed,\" Rabin noted.</p><p>She also agreed with David that cervical cancer screening has long been a \"gateway\" to better gynecologic care generally.</p><p>\"My concern is if they stop coming for Pap tests, they will miss an examination which may help uncover other medical and gynecological issues, such as breast, uterine, ovarian and colon cancer,\" Rabin said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-fact-sheet\" target=\"_new\">HPV</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 19, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- When someone with HIV has the virus suppressed with medication, there is virtually no chance of passing it on to sex partners, a new review concludes.</p><p>The Public Health Agency of Canada pulled together studies from the last decade looking at the risk of HIV transmission among partners where one person is HIV-positive and one is not.</p><p>It found there were no cases of transmission when the HIV-positive partner was on drug \"cocktails\" that were keeping the virus suppressed. \"Suppressed\" means there are fewer than 200 copies of the virus per milliliter of blood.</p><p>In those cases, the review found, there were no HIV transmissions even when couples did not use condoms.</p><p>Experts said the findings are good news for people living with HIV -- and have implications for current laws in Canada, the United States and elsewhere.</p><p>At issue are laws that subject HIV-positive people to possible criminal prosecution for not telling their sexual partners about their status. They exist in Canada and many U.S. states.</p><p>But the laws are \"rooted in the 1980s view of the disease,\" said Perry Halkitis, dean of the School of Public Health at Rutgers University in Piscataway, N.J.</p><p>That is, they reflect an era when HIV was a death sentence instead of the manageable chronic condition it is today. Drug therapies that first became available in the 1990s changed the face of HIV treatment.</p><p>And in recent years, Halkitis said, studies have offered \"a ton of evidence\" that when those drugs suppress the virus, it is not transmissible to person's sex partners.</p><p>\"These criminalization laws do nothing but stigmatize HIV-positive people. They need to be revisited,\" said Halkitis, who was not involved in the new research.</p><p>In Canada, the findings have already had an impact. The Department of Justice Canada, which collaborated on the review, issued a report last December saying that criminal law should no longer apply to HIV-positive people who have their virus suppressed by medication.</p><p>Its report also said the laws should not apply to people who are not on medication but use condoms during sex. In the research review, the risk of HIV transmission in those cases was deemed to be \"low\" -- at just over 1 transmission for every 100 people per year.</p><p>The health agency used the word \"negligible\" to describe the risk of transmission when the virus is suppressed by medication. That means there is a theoretical risk of transmission because there is an \"exchange of bodily fluids that carry the virus,\" officials said -- but no actual confirmed cases.</p><p>\"We hope these findings help people living with HIV and their partners to make decisions, and that they help reduce the stigma experienced by people living with HIV,\" the agency said.</p><p>The latest review, led by the agency's Dr. Rachel Rodin, is based on 11 studies and one previously published research review. The studies followed steady partners -- both heterosexual and same-sex -- in various countries.</p><p>The results were published Nov. 19 in the <i>CMAJ: Canadian Medical Association Journal</i>.</p> <p>In the United States, 29 states have \"HIV-specific\" criminal laws, according to the nonprofit Center for HIV Law &amp; Policy (CHLP). That includes laws that target people who fail to disclose their HIV status to sexual partners.</p><p>Many medical organizations, like the American Medical Association and American Psychological Association, have long called for reform of those criminal laws. And the CHLP and other groups argue that it's not enough to exempt HIV-positive people who have their virus suppressed through medication.</p><p>The CHLP points to the fact that Americans have unequal access to health care, and certain groups -- including blacks and the poor -- face more obstacles in keeping their HIV levels suppressed.</p><p>That means they are unfairly targeted by criminal laws, the CHLP says.</p><p>Halkitis agreed that having HIV-specific laws at all is problematic. No other transmissible disease is subject to such criminal prosecution, he pointed out.</p><p>\"We have to stop reacting to HIV like it's still the 1980s,\" Halkitis said. And that, he added, includes having policies that are \"grounded in scientific evidence.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/transmission.html\" target=\"_new\">HIV transmission</a>.</p>",

You want a lifelong diet plan that provides micronutrients, fiber and antioxidants while still limiting calories.</p><p>That means whether you count calories or portion sizes, it's important to keep track of all high-calorie foods, even the healthful ones.</p><p>Here are some examples.</p><p>While plant oils -- such as walnut, olive, safflower, sunflower, grapeseed and sesame oils -- are better for you than butter with all its saturated fat, tablespoon for tablespoon, oils actually have more calories -- 120 to 130 calories compared to butter's 100. Use an oil spray to coat pans before cooking to conserve calories when you really need to use oil.</p><p>When eating a rainbow of veggies, winter squash and sweet potatoes are great choices in the orange color range, but 4 ounces of squash have only 44 calories compared to 84 calories for the same amount of sweet potatoes. If you need a large portion to feel full, eating squash will allow you twice the volume for the same number of calories.</p><p>Among the most nutrient-dense fruits, a large banana can have 120 calories while a cup of strawberries is barely 50. </p><p>Nutrient-rich, high-calorie foods are still good for you, but consider cutting portion sizes in half to keep the needed ceiling on your overall calorie intake.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Need a portion size reminder?

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Dec. 4, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Researchers say the ever-growing waiting list of hopeful heart transplant recipients could be trimmed down  if only more patients were given the option to open their hearts to unlikely donors.</p> <p>Two new Stanford University-led studies published Dec. 4 explore opportunities to expand the donor pool by using hearts that many transplant centers overlook: those that once belonged to people who had an active hepatitis C infection, and to those who were obese.</p> <p>The number of heart transplants has risen steadily over the past decade. More than 100,000 Americans are sick enough to need a heart transplant, but in 2017, only 3,244 actually received one. </p> <p>\"In order to meet the recipient demands of heart transplantation, we need to consider out-of- the-box strategies to expand the donor pool,\" said Dr. Yas Moayedi, lead author of a study published in the American Heart Association's journal <i>Circulation: Heart Failure</i> that looked at using hearts from donors who tested positive for hepatitis C.</p> <p>Researchers used a national registry of organ transplants and analyzed 2014-2017 data on 1,306 heart donors with hepatitis C, a blood-borne virus than can be effectively treated with antiviral medication. </p> <p>They found only 5 percent of these infected hearts were used in transplants. Yet, those heart recipients had no difference in survival within the first year of transplant compared with patients who received hearts from donors without hepatitis C. Longer-term data is needed to confirm if the positive results persist. </p> <p>The number of hepatitis C-positive donors has increased steadily since 2014, along with deaths attributed to drug overdoses related to the nation's opioid epidemic, researchers noted in the study. Heroin addicts often share needles, contributing to the rise of hepatitis C infections. </p> <p>Because the opioid epidemic has predominantly affected young adults, the average age of heart donors with hepatitis C has dropped in the last five years from 47 to 35, the study found. </p> <p>The younger age means these donors usually have fewer health problems associated with older donors, like high blood pressure or diabetes, and would normally be considered \"incredibly viable\" candidates  outside of the hepatitis C, said Moayedi, a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University in California. </p> <p>In a separate study released in the <i>Journal of the American Heart Association</i>, researchers found a similar positive outcome for patients who received their hearts from donors who were obese.</p> <p>Transplant centers reject the hearts of obese donors mainly because they believe such grafts are inferior, even though little evidence supports that idea, said Dr. Yasuhiro Shudo, the lead author of the study and an assistant professor at Stanford University School of Medicine.</p> <p>Those centers may soon not have a choice.</p> <p>\"We're seeing a (high) prevalence of obesity in the general population,\" said Shudo, pointing out that about one-third of U.S. adults are obese. \"As we see more obese people, this will lead to having more obese donors in the future.\"</p> <p>Using the same national transplant registry as the other study, the researchers examined data on 31,920 adults who received heart transplants from 2001 through 2016 and separated the donors into four groups based on their body mass index, or BMI, a ratio of weight to height often used to calculate overweight and obesity. </p> <p>Of all transplant patients, about 41 percent received a heart from donors with a normal BMI. The other patients received hearts from patients with a BMI classifying them as overweight (35 percent of total donors), obese (15 percent) or extremely obese (9 percent).</p> <p>The researchers found no significant difference in overall survival among the four groups.</p> <p>Dr. Michael Givertz, a Harvard Medical School professor who was not involved in either study but wrote an editorial that accompanied the report about hepatitis C donors, said both studies examine \"this large potential opportunity to access donor organs that would otherwise not be used.\"</p> <p> He said more research is needed to explore the impact of using hearts from donors with hepatitis C, but overall both studies offer tremendous potential and promise.</p> <p>\"There are patients who never make it to transplant because they die on the waiting list. And there are opportunities here to offer them an organ and a successful transplantation,\" said Givertz, medical director of the heart transplant and mechanical circulatory support program at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.</p> <p>The key is educating patients about the potential risks of using unconventional donors and weighing those risks against waiting even longer, possibly indefinitely, on the transplant list.</p> <p>\"Once the recipient and their families understand the relative balance of these risks, I've found, and many colleagues have found, that most people are willing to move forward,\" Givertz said.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Dec. 4, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Exposure to chemicals found in a wide array of personal care products has been linked to early puberty among girls, a new investigation warns.</p><p>The issue centers on specific chemicals including phthalates, parabens and phenols. They're found in an array of products, including perfumes, soaps, shampoos, nail polish, cosmetics, toothpaste, lipstick, hairsprays and skin lotions -- to name just a few.</p><p>These chemicals \"get into our bodies either by absorption through the skin, by being inhaled, or being ingested [like lipstick],\" explained study author Kim Harley. \"Once they are in the body, they are quite quickly metabolized and [then] excreted in urine.\"</p><p>Harley is associate director of the Center for Environmental Research and Children's Health at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p>As to how routine exposure to the chemicals might affect puberty, she said they've \"been shown to mimic estrogen in certain laboratory conditions.\"</p><p>In fact, prior animal studies have suggested that exposure can throw puberty timing out of whack, Harley said.</p><p>Now, her team found that \"the  higher the levels of the chemicals in mothers' or daughters' bodies, the earlier the puberty\" among girls. No such link was found for the timing of male puberty, however. </p><p>\"We were a little surprised that the associations were only with girls and we didn't see much with boys,\" Harley said. \"But since these tend to be estrogenic chemicals, it makes sense that they might impact girls.\"</p><p>To explore the issue, investigators analyzed data collected in a study that enrolled pregnant women between 1999 and 2000. The women had blood tests twice throughout their pregnancy, and interviews were also conducted to gauge exposure to the chemicals in question.</p><p>Nine in 10 of all the urine samples taken from the expectant moms tested positive for chemicals that fall into one of the three chemical classes of concern, with slightly lower percentages (about seven in 10) with respect to a chemical called triclosan. An antimicrobial, triclosan was banned for use in soap by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2017, but it can still be found in some toothpastes, the researchers noted.</p><p>In the study, the scientists tracked 338 of the women's offspring through adolescence, with urine samples analyzed at the age of 9. Onset of puberty was then checked regularly between the ages of 9 and 13.</p><p>The researchers determined that for every doubling of a woman's blood level of phthalates, the development of her daughter's pubic hair started 1.3 months earlier than usual.</p><p>A doubling of a mother's triclosan levels was also linked to a one-month earlier start of her daughter's first period, the study found.</p><p>Blood tests were also take of the children themselves. Harley's group found that a doubling of paraben levels in girls was linked to the one-month earlier onset of both breast and pubic hair development.</p><p>Harley stressed that the findings are \"definitely not\" absolute proof that such chemical exposure actually causes early puberty among girls. \"There is always the possibility that there were confounding factors that we were not able to control, or that our findings were due to chance,\" she explained.</p><p>\"That said, our findings are consistent with what we know about the endocrine-disrupting properties of these chemicals,\" said Harley. \"So, although we are not ready to say that early life exposure to these chemicals causes earlier puberty in girls, we have enough evidence to be concerned.\"</p><p>The findings were published in the Dec. 4 issue of the journal <i>Human Reproduction</i>.</p><p>An industry group said the study had limitations.</p><p>\"Levels were determined in the mothers' urine by measurement of a single sample at each of two time points during pregnancy. In the children, levels were determined in a single sample taken at age 9,\" noted Linda Loretz, chief toxicologist at the Personal Care Products Council.</p><p>\"Patterns of exposure may have varied greatly over the course of pregnancy in the mothers, and between the ages of 9 and 13 in the boys and girls, so the representativeness of the exposure levels is unknown,\" she added.</p><p>\"Furthermore, as phthalates, parabens and phenols are all rapidly excreted from the body, measured levels will change not just over months and years, but over the course of a single day, so that any given measurement reflects only a specific moment in time,\" she added.</p><p>Last but not least, \"the researchers also acknowledge exposure to other environmental chemicals, such as pesticides encountered during farm working, might also affect the results,\" Loretz concluded.</p><p>But one other expert said the findings aren't so surprising.</p><p>Dr. Margaret Cuomo is a board-certified radiologist who formerly served as an attending physician in diagnostic radiology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y. She said \"many previous studies have reported the association between the chemicals that are called 'endocrine disruptors' and human health\".</p><p>As to what consumers can do, Cuomo suggested checking out the website of the watchdog organization Environmental Working Group. There you can \"find a list of those products that are relatively safe to use,\" meaning products that are free of parabens, phthalates, triclosan and similar chemicals.</p> <p>Cuomo also advised picking household cleaners and detergents are that \"environmentally safe,\" and opting for organic foods when possible.</p><p>\"States such as California and Washington have laws protecting consumers from harmful chemicals in a variety of products,\" she added. \"[And] New York is the first state to require disclosure of harmful chemicals by manufacturers of household cleaning agents. Hopefully, New York State's initiative will be extended soon to include many other consumer products.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on puberty at the <a href=\"https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/puberty\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</a>.</p>",

It was generally believed that Parkinson's did not affect life expectancy, but recent studies have found a somewhat shorter life span for people with the disease.</p><p>Seeking clarification, Backstrom's team looked at 182 patients newly diagnosed with Parkinson's disease or other types of parkinsonism. The study patients were followed for nearly 14 years.</p><p>The patients' mental abilities (thinking and memory skills) were tested at the start of the study period and annually after that. During the study, 109 participants died. </p><p>Those who had problems with memory and thinking skills (mild cognitive impairment) at the start of the study were more than twice as likely to die during the follow-up period than people who didn't have these problems, the investigators found.</p><p>Average age at the study's start was about 71 for people with Parkinson's disease. Expected survival for people with no mild cognitive impairment was nearly 12 years, compared with just over 8 years for those with mild cognitive impairment, the findings showed.</p><p>Multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy are two types of parkinsonism likely to affect thinking and memory. People with these diseases had a shortened life expectancy, with a death rate more than three times higher than that of the general population, the researchers reported.</p><p>In all, 54 percent of people with Parkinson's died during the study period, compared with 89 percent of those with progressive supranuclear palsy and 92 percent of those with multiple system atrophy, according to the report.</p><p> The study authors said that expected survival was six years for people with progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system atrophy.</p> <p> Backstrom and his team pointed out that other factors that appeared early in the disease were associated with a shorter life span. They included brief episodes where people were unable to walk or lost their sense of smell.</p><p>One limitation of the study was that only five autopsies were performed to confirm the diagnoses.

The more laws there are, the fewer deaths there are,\" Chao said.</p><p>Lax firearms laws, in particular, create an increased risk for suicide among children, the researchers found.</p><p>Laws that limit children's access to guns -- requirements for locking mechanisms on guns, keeping firearms in locked boxes or safes, and storing guns separate from ammunition -- protected kids from suicide, the study found.</p><p>\"States that didn't have any laws designed to specifically protect children had four times the pediatric suicide death rate as states that had laws that both required safe gun storage and said you can't provide a gun to a child,\" Chao said.</p><p>She and her colleagues compared federal statistics on child gun-related deaths with a scorecard maintained by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. The group rates gun law stringency state-by-state.</p><p>Arizona has the loosest guns laws, while California is the strictest, according to the Brady Campaign.</p><p>The study found that the link between child gun deaths and gun control laws persisted even after the researchers controlled for other factors like poverty, unemployment and substance abuse.</p><p>Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said, \"It's more evidence of what we already know, which is that guns are an independent determinant of injury and death, separate from pretty much anything else.\" </p><p>There also appeared to be a spillover effect. The safety of children in any given state was affected by the stringency of firearm legislation in neighboring states, the researchers said.</p><p>\"It's clearly access,\" said Benjamin. \"Kids are finding those firearms. And it's not just preventable shootings, where a child picked up a gun and somehow fired it. It's also suicides. This really nails the case that it's about the guns and the firearm availability.\" </p><p>Firearm laws also influence the number of gun injuries sustained by kids, according to the study.</p><p>Regions with higher average Brady scores, the Northeast and West, had 7.5 injuries per 100,000 children, the researchers said. This compared with 8.3 injuries per 100,000 children in the Midwest and South, where average Brady scores were low.</p><p>The study results are scheduled for presentation Monday at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Pediatrics, in Orlando, Fla.</p><p>Another research team presenting at the AAP conference found that most children can't tell a real gun from a toy gun by looking at it.</p><p>For the study, Dr. Kiesha Fraser Doh and her colleagues surveyed about 300 caregiver-child pairs visiting one of three pediatric emergency departments in the southeastern United States over a three-month period in 2017.</p><p>Only 41 percent of kids aged 7 to 17 could tell a toy gun from an actual firearm when shown side-by-side photos of both, the researchers found.</p><p>This is worrisome because the gun owners surveyed were nearly twice as likely as non-gun owners to let their children play with toy guns, said Dr. Fraser Doh, an emergency medicine physician at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta.</p><p>Also, only one-third of the gun owners stored their guns locked, unloaded and separate from ammunition, as recommended by the AAP, the researchers found.</p><p>\"Part of the messaging we would want parents to give their children is if they see a firearm, walk away,\" Fraser Doh said. If a kid can't tell a real gun from a toy gun by sight, they are more likely to go over and play with what turns out to be a real firearm.</p><p>Research presented at meetings is usually considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics has more about <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/campaigns/gun-safety/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_new\">gun safety and children</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 6, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Kids with summer birthdays, especially those who spend long hours playing on smartphones and tablets, might be at greater risk for vision problems, a new study suggests.</p><p>Nearsightedness, also called myopia, is on the rise worldwide. It's what eye doctors call a refractive error, meaning the eyes can't focus light properly. The result: Close objects look clear; distant ones, fuzzy.</p><p>It's most often caused by continuously focusing on close objects while the eyes are still developing -- as in reading, for example. But the growing use of electronic devices seems to be making the problem worse, researchers report.</p><p>\"As ever, everything should be done in moderation,\" said lead researcher Dr. Christopher Hammond, chairman of ophthalmology at King's College London in England. He urged parents to limit kids' use of electronic devices.</p><p>That appears to be especially important for kids born in the summer, the study suggests. That's because they start formal schooling at a younger age than kids born in winter so they are exposed to more reading sooner. And that increases myopia risk, the researchers said.</p><p>The researchers added that, while their study doesn't prove smartphones, tablets and computer games cause nearsightedness, those devices may lead kids to spend less time outdoors. And less time outdoors also appears to increase myopia risk. </p><p>\"We know that time outdoors is protective, and so kids should spend probably up to two hours a day outside,\" Hammond said.</p> <p>Myopia can be corrected with glasses, laser surgery or contact lenses. Later in life, however, sufferers are more likely to develop sight-robbing conditions such as cataracts or glaucoma, the researchers said.</p><p>Experts predict that by 2050, nearly 5 billion people worldwide will have myopia. That compares to about 2 billion in 2010.</p><p>Genes have been linked to a person's risk for the condition, but even if it has a genetic component, that doesn't account for the dramatic increase, Hammond said.</p><p>For the study, his team collected data on nearly 2,000 twins born in the United Kingdom between 1994 and 1996. </p><p>The researchers reviewed results of eye tests, as well as social, economic, educational and behavioral data on the twins between the ages of 2 and 16. They also had questionnaires completed by parents and teachers. </p><p>On average, children started wearing glasses for myopia at age 11. About 5 percent had amblyopia (\"lazy eye\"), and about 4.5 percent had a squint. Overall, 26 percent of the twins were nearsighted, the study found.</p><p>Kids who had college-educated mothers, those who were born in summer months and those who spent more time using electronic devices had a higher likelihood of nearsightedness, the study found. </p><p>The findings were published online Nov. 6 in the <i>British Journal of Ophthalmology</i>.</p><p>Dr. Tien Wong, medical director of the Singapore National Eye Center, is co-author of an editorial that accompanied the study.</p><p>\"Evidence supports a link between device screen time and myopia, which includes time on phones and tablets,\" he said.</p><p>This is concerning in view of how many young kids have access to these devices, Wong said. Evidence shows 2-year-olds spend up to two hours a day using digital devices.</p><p>\"Managing your child's device screen time and increasing their outdoor play can help reduce the risk of developing myopia,\" Wong said. \"We must better monitor our children's device activities, even during their preschool years.\"</p><p>Surprisingly, the researchers said children born as a result of fertility treatment had a 25 percent to 30 percent lower risk for myopia. They said that may be because many are born premature and have developmental delays, which could account for shorter eye length and less myopia.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>To learn more about myopia, visit the <a href=\"https://nei.nih.gov/health/errors/myopia\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. National Eye Institute</a>.</p>",

Our results so far suggest that this is a gradual, rather than a sudden, shift,\" lead researcher Disa Sauter said in a Canadian Acoustical Association news release. </p><p>This shift doesn't seem to be linked to any particular developmental milestones.</p><p>The vocal control developed as people learn to speak may be why humans are the lone primates that laugh only when they exhale, Sauter said. She's a psychologist and associate professor at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands.</p><p>Researchers are now investigating if there's a link between the amount of laughter produced on the inhale and exhale and the reasons people laugh, which also change with age. In infants, laughter is tied to physical play like tickling. In older people, laughter is triggered by physical play as well as social interactions.</p><p>\"Beyond that, I'd be interested in seeing whether our findings apply to other vocalizations than laughter,\" Sauter said.</p><p>This research could lead to new insight about vocal production in children with developmental disorders.</p><p>\"If we know what normally developing babies sound like, it could be interesting to study infants at risk to see whether there are very early signs of atypical development in their nonverbal vocalizations of emotion,\" Sauter explained.</p><p>The study is scheduled for presentation Wednesday at a Canadian Acoustical Association meeting in Victoria, British Columbia.

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 16, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Rainy days may bring a lot more than relief from summer heat --  they also are connected to better survival chances and overall outlook for stroke survivors, according to a new study.</p> <p>Researchers examining the connection between strokes and seasonal weather in the United States found that hospital admissions for ischemic strokes, those caused by blood clots, went up during winter. The season also was associated with a higher chance of patients dying during their hospital stay.</p> <p>But after adjusting for various factors, including regional climate and patient demographics and medical history, the wintertime increase didn't prove to be as significant, researchers reported in the Yale University-led study published Friday in the <i>Journal of the American Heart Association</i>.</p> <p>\"What that told us was that there's something about winter, rather than simply the season itself, that was mediating this relationship. And the strong variables there turned out to be temperature and precipitation,\" said Dr. Stacy Chu, the study's lead author and a clinical fellow in the neurocritical care and emergency neurology division of the Yale School of Medicine in Connecticut.</p> <p>The study examined data on 457,638 people who had a stroke. Researchers also gathered daily climate records for the nation's nine regions to get the temperature and precipitation level, not including snowfall, on the day of hospital admission, as well as averages over the seven days before hospitalization. </p> <p>The warmer and wetter weather found in spring and summer was associated with a better chance of survival and overall better outcome after a stroke, the study showed. </p> <p>The research, which was funded by the American Heart Association, did not address why more strokes happen in the winter or reasons behind the association between weather and how well people recover. But the investigators noted that previous research has shown that blood pressure and other cardiovascular risks go up during the winter. </p> <p>One main reason that happens is because blood vessels constrict in cold weather to help the body conserve heat, said Dr. Carolyn Brockington, director of the Stroke Center at Mount Sinai West and Mount Sinai St. Luke's hospitals in New York City.</p> <p>\"Think of blood vessels going to the brain almost like plumbing, and the pipes are getting smaller, with less blood getting to the brain. So, it might in some way precipitate an event like a stroke or heart attack,\" said Brockington, who was not part of the new study.</p> <p>People may also easily become dehydrated during the winter because they don't think about drinking water and other fluids as often as they do in warmer months, she said. Dehydration can lead to thicker blood, which can be more prone to clotting.</p> <p>Strokes are generally viewed as preventable, Brockington said. While some risk factors for stroke can't be changed, such as age and family history, most others can be treated or controlled any time of the year. </p> <p>\"If you have high blood pressure, many times that means diet changes, exercise and sometimes medication. If you have diabetes, the same thing. If you smoke, you can learn ways to stop,\" Brockington said. </p> <p>The study may offer another modifiable risk factor for stroke, she added.</p> <p>\"The message is, partner with your doctor and go through your own individual risk factors and modify them appropriately,\" she said. \"That's extremely important whether it's winter, spring, summer or fall.\"</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 2, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Ruling against the recommendation of one of its chief experts, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved an extremely potent new opioid painkiller, Dsuvia.</p><p>The drug is a 30-microgram pill that packs the same punch as 5 milligrams of intravenous morphine, according to the <i>Washington Post</i>. The tiny pill comes packaged in a syringe-like applicator and would be used under the tongue for quick absorption.  Dsuvia (sufentanil) will be marketed by California-based maker AcelRX.</p><p>The drug is for very restricted use in operating rooms or on the battlefield. Indeed, its potential use by soldiers was one reason Dsuvia was approved, according to FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb.</p><p>\"The FDA has made it a high priority to make sure our soldiers have access to treatments that meet the unique needs of the battlefield, including when intravenous administration is not possible for the treatment of acute pain,\" Gottlieb said in an agency news release.</p><p>But Dsuvia's approval comes amid controversy, with an epidemic of opioid abuse continuing to ravage the United States. Experts worry that supplies of the drug will somehow make their way from doctors' offices and pharmacies to addicts.</p><p>An FDA advisory committee did recommend for approval of Dsuvia in a 10-3 vote last month.  But the committee's chair took the highly unusual move of voicing his opposition at that time. Dr. Raeford Brown, a professor of anesthesiology and pediatrics at the University of Kentucky, urged the FDA to reject the drug.</p><p>\"I am very disappointed with the decision of the agency to approve Dsuvia. This action is inconsistent with the charter of the agency,\" Brown said in a statement Friday. \"I will continue to hold the agency accountable for their response to the worst public health problem since the 1918 influenza epidemic.\"</p><p>The consumer watchdog group Public Citizen has also come out strongly against approval. In a statement issued Friday, the group contended that, \"if approved, Dsuvia will be abused and start killing people as soon as it hits the market.\"</p><p>Public Citizen described the drug as \"five to 10 times more potent than fentanyl and 1,000 times more potent than morphine.\"</p><p>But Gottlieb stressed Friday that his agency has placed very tight restrictions on Dsuvia.</p><p>\"To address concerns about the potential risks associated with Dsuvia, this product will have strong limitations on its use,\" Gottlieb said. \"It can't be dispensed to patients for home use and should not be used for more than 72 hours. And it should only be administered by a health care provider using a single-dose applicator. That means it won't be available at retail pharmacies for patients to take home.\"</p><p>The drug is also only for use by patients who cannot tolerate other painkillers, or for whom other painkillers have failed or are expected to fail.</p><p>The United States continues to struggle with the opioid abuse epidemic.  On Friday, new statistics released by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration found the number of opioid overdose deaths in the United States reached a new record last year with 72,000 deaths -- about 200 per day.</p><p>And even as his agency gave the nod to Dsuvia, Gottlieb said other steps are being taken to restrict access to highly potent opioids.</p><p>\"The agency is taking new steps to more actively confront this crisis, while also paying careful attention to the needs of patients and physicians managing pain,\" he said. Part of that effort may be a closer and more stringent assessment of the need for new opioid formulations going forward, Gottlieb added.</p><p>\"To that end, I've asked the professional staff at the FDA to evaluate a new framework for opioid analgesic approvals,\" he said. Already, it's clear that in the context of the opioid crisis, \"our evaluation of opioids is different than how we assess drugs in other therapeutic classes,\" Gottlieb noted.</p><p>As for Dsuvia, even after approval, \"the FDA will continue to carefully monitor the implementation of the [regulatory safeguards] associated with Dsuvia and compliance with its requirements, and we'll work to quickly make regulatory adjustments if problems arise,\" Gottlieb said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>There's more on pain control at the  <a href=\"https://www.asahq.org/whensecondscount/pain-management/\" target=\"_new\">American Society of Anesthesiologists</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 5, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Otherwise healthy women diagnosed with postpartum depression may be at higher risk of a heart attack, stroke or heart failure, a new study suggests.</p><p>Acting on mounting evidence linking clinical depression to cardiovascular disease, researchers sought to explore whether other forms of depression might also increase the risk for conditions affecting the heart or brain.</p> <p>They examined a registry of 1.8 million California women who did not have a history of cardiovascular disease or chronic depression. Of those women, 40,276 were diagnosed with postpartum depression.</p><p>Within roughly five years of giving birth, the women who had postpartum depression had a nearly 70 percent higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease, including heart attack, stroke and heart failure. And that was even after adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes and high blood pressure, pregnancy-related conditions such as preeclampsia, and social and behavioral factors such as smoking, alcohol use and insurance access.</p><p>The findings will be presented Nov. 11 at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions meeting in Chicago.</p> <p>What's causing these women to be more at risk is uncertain, said Dr. Punag Divanji, the study's lead researcher and a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco.</p><p>Among the possibilities is a link to the drop in estrogen and progesterone after childbirth. These two hormones increase exponentially during pregnancy, and women with postpartum depression may have a greater decline in levels after childbirth than other new mothers.</p><p>But more research needs to be conducted before actual causal reasons can be pinned down, Divanji said.</p> <p>\"There's still a lot of work to be done in terms of better understanding cardiovascular risk in women,\" he said, particularly risk factors other than high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.</p> <p>Dr. Leslie Cho, director of the Women's Cardiology Center at The Cleveland Clinic, agreed that more research would help validate the findings, as well as shed light on the mechanics behind them.</p><p>\"What we do know is that if you're depressed, straight-up depressed, you tend to eat badly. You tend to drink. If you're depressed, you don't tend to exercise,\" said Cho, was not connected with the new study. \"It goes with so many other unhealthy lifestyle choices.\"</p> <p>Past studies have shown a link between clinical depression and its impact on cardiovascular disease, including high blood pressure, Cho said.</p><p>\"It's been linked with platelet reactivity -- your platelets are more sticky when you're depressed,\" meaning there's a greater chance they could clump and form a blot clot, she said. \"So, there are all sorts of interesting heart-brain connections there.\"</p> <p>She noted that women of all ages should consider having their cardiovascular risk assessed anyway because heart disease is the leading cause of death for women.</p><p>Divanji said he hopes the study will help raise awareness about the potential link between all types of depression and cardiovascular disease.</p><p>\"This level of evidence isn't sufficient enough to say we need to sound the alarm but rather, this is something to be aware of and think more about,\" he said. \"When we see patients, we should be cognizant that depression plays a role in future cardiovascular disease risk.\"</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 5, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- New research shows that electronic cigarettes contain chemicals that cause heart damage, adding to the growing list of concerns about their safety.</p> <p>The study, which will be presented Nov. 12 at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions meeting in Chicago, investigated the effect that e-cigarettes have on the endothelial cells that line the inside of the body's blood vessels. Endothelial cells produce nitric oxide, a molecule that helps keep blood vessels healthy and control blood pressure levels.</p> <p>Chemicals in traditional cigarettes decrease the production of nitric oxide, which is one of the reasons smoking causes heart damage. The new study was designed to see if e-cigarettes have a similar effect.</p><p> The researchers collected blood samples from 36 tobacco users, e-cigarette users and nonsmokers. In the lab, they exposed blood vessel endothelial cells to the volunteers' blood serum. The serum is the liquid that remains after the red and white blood cells, blood platelets and clotting factors have been removed.</p><p>The lab results showed that endothelial cells exposed to blood serum from e-cigarette users produced less nitric oxide and contained less of the enzyme that produces nitric oxide compared to serum from nonsmokers.</p> <p>\"We showed that blood serum from electronic cigarette users has harmful effects that are similar to that of (tobacco) cigarettes on endothelial cell functions,\" said the study's lead researcher, Dr. Leila Mohammadi, a postdoctoral fellow at the Cardiovascular Research Institute at the University of California, San Francisco. \"This harmful effect is likely to adversely affect arteries and cardiovascular health.\"</p> <p>Matthew Springer, the study's principal investigator, said the findings highlight another safety concern related to e-cigarettes.</p> <p>\"You have various products (like e-cigarettes) that are assumed to be safer than cigarettes, and they might be, but safer isn't the same thing as harmless,\" said Springer, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.</p> <p>Aruni Bhatnagar, a professor of medicine at the University of Louisville and co-director of the heart association's Tobacco Regulation and Addiction Center, called the study \"a step in the right direction.\"</p> <p>\"There is a push from the tobacco industry to say e-cigarettes are safer,\" said Bhatnagar, who was not involved with the research. \"But this study raises a flag and supports the idea that e-cigarettes are not harmless to cardiovascular health. There is significant (blood vessel) injury that might be associated with long-term e-cigarette use.\"</p><p>It is not known what substance contained in e-cigarettes caused the decrease in nitric oxide, the researchers noted.</p> <p>Mohammadi and Springer both said they'd like to see future studies that look at the health of actual endothelial cells in the blood vessels of e-cigarette users. They would also like to see studies that look at the effects of the specific ingredients and flavors in e-cigarettes, including nicotine, propylene glycol and glycerin.</p> <p>\"All of the different flavors are a different chemical, and some of them could have harmful effects,\" Springer said.</p> <p>One big challenge facing researchers is the constant introduction of new e-cigarette products, each with its own list of ingredients, that are marketed as smart alternatives to smoking.</p> <p>The research is showing \"that anything you inhale other than clean air seems to be causing vascular problems,\" said Springer. \"Rather than try to find the things to inhale that aren't as bad as cigarettes, we might have to realize (we need) to just breathe clean air.\"</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 9, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Women confused by the conflicting advice surrounding the benefits and timing of mammograms will be interested in a new study out of Sweden.</p><p>The research, involving more than 50,000 breast cancer patients, found that those who took part in a breast cancer screening program had a 60 percent lower risk of dying from the disease in the 10 years after diagnosis, and a 47 percent lower risk 20 years after diagnosis.</p><p>\"This is really what we've been waiting for because there has been so much hoopla about mammography not reducing the death rate from breast cancer,\" said Dr. Lauren Cassell, chief of breast surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. She was not involved with the study.</p><p>Many people have said it's better treatment, and not screening, that has improved survival, Cassell explained.</p><p>\"But when you do pick up cancers earlier, patients do better,\" she said. \"We've had a gut feeling that early detection makes a difference, and now we can prove it.\"</p><p>Study co-author Robert Smith, vice president for cancer screening at the American Cancer Society, said, \"The advantage of screening is that it offers a woman, if she develops breast cancer, the opportunity to treat that cancer early when the treatment can be less aggressive and when she has more treatment choices.\"</p><p>Finding cancer in an early stage may also avoid aggressive treatments that can diminish quality of life, he added.</p><p>\"Mammography today, in the setting of modern therapy, confers a substantial benefit to women who attend regular screening,\" Smith said. \"The mortality reductions we observe are principally due to mammography detecting the most aggressive cancers early.\"</p><p>While the findings may seem obvious, the effect of mammograms on survival is something that's been debated in recent years.</p><p>The American Cancer Society recommends annual breast cancer screening for women aged 45 to 54, while the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends mammograms every other year for women aged 50 to 74.</p><p>The task force says the evidence for earlier screening isn't convincing, but women should make that decision on an individual basis.</p><p>Part of the discrepancy is caused by how the evidence is gathered, Smith explained.</p><p>Much of the data that has gone into making recommendations came from older studies that weren't able to clearly break out the benefit of early screening on survival, he said.</p><p>Early screening finds cancers that wouldn't show symptoms for years, Smith said. Also, survival from breast cancer can get confused with improvements in treatment, making it hard to tease out the benefit of screening, he added.</p><p>For the new study, researchers were able to take advantage of highly detailed Swedish data that spanned 52 years. This enabled the researchers to look at data from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, when widespread screening didn't exist, and 39 years later, when widespread screening was available.</p><p>What's more, the data for the new study were \"individualized\" -- so researchers could look at the outcome of every woman in the registry who had breast cancer and whether she was screened or not. This enabled Smith's team to pinpoint the effect of screening on survival.</p> <p>The researchers also were able to quantify the benefit of screening by looking at deaths after diagnosis.</p><p>\"The latest study adds to the large body of literature that demonstrates early detection of breast cancer through screening programs saves the most lives,\" said Dr. Nicole Saphier, director of breast imaging at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Monmouth Regional, in Middletown, N.J.</p><p>Breast cancers in women aged 40 to 49 tend to grow faster than breast cancers in older women, she said. \"This means mammography and early detection are essential in these women, when the chances of survival are highest,\" she added.</p><p>For the study, Smith and his colleagues collected data on more than 52,400 women aged 40 to 69 in Dalarna, Sweden. All were diagnosed with breast cancer between 1977 and 2015. All the patients received the latest treatment for their stage of cancer, regardless of how it was found.</p><p>Dr. Jay Baker is president of the Society of Breast Imaging. In a society news release, he said that, \"The conclusion of this study could not be more clear -- modern treatments are important but not solely sufficient. Women who get regular screening mammograms cut their risk of dying of breast cancer by about half.\"</p><p>The findings were published online Nov. 8 in the journal <i>Cancer</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>To learn more about breast cancer screening, visit the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/special-coverage/american-cancer-society-breast-cancer-screening-guidelines.html\" target=\"_new\"> American Cancer Society</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 13, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- People who overdose on opioids have one lifeline, the drug naloxone, but two new studies find that many pharmacies won't offer this lifesaving antidote without a doctor's blessing.</p><p>Though many states have passed laws mandating that naloxone be made available without a prescription, researchers from California found that fewer than 25 percent of pharmacies in that state would give the drug without a prescription. And in the second study from Texas, investigators found that although 8 in 10 drugstores would dispense the drug, less than 7 in 10 had naloxone in stock.</p><p>Why? A lack of training, a lack of desire to make room for the drug on their shelves, and outright moral objections to giving an opioid user a medication that might encourage drug abuse, the scientists said.</p><p>\"We have an opioid crisis in our country, and we have a large number of opioid overdose deaths, about half of which are due to prescription opioids,\" said Talia Puzantian, lead researcher of the first study, and associate professor of clinical sciences at Keck Graduate Institute School of Pharmacy and Health Sciences in Claremont, Calif.</p> <p>People getting prescriptions for these narcotic painkillers may not think they are at risk for overdosing, she said. \"But these drugs have significant safety issues,\" Puzantian said.</p><p>Part of a pharmacist's role is to educate patients about the dangers of opioids and make naloxone available when they think the patients may be at risk for an overdose, she said. These include people who are taking high doses of the painkillers or are mixing them with other drugs that can increase the risk.</p><p>Since 2016, California law has allowed pharmacists to provide naloxone without a prescription.</p><p>For the California study, Puzantian and her colleagues called more than 1,100 pharmacies asking if they would provide naloxone without a physician's prescription. Fewer than 25 percent said they would. Of those, only about 50 percent stocked nasal spray naloxone, the researchers found.</p><p>Puzantian said that pharmacists need to be taught about the law allowing them to give patients naloxone without a prescription.</p><p>In addition, they need to have the drug on hand. Many pharmacies that don't stock naloxone said they didn't have the shelf space, given all the other more popular drugs they need to carry and the low demand for naloxone.</p><p>Some pharmacists have a moral objection to providing drugs to opioid users, Puzantian said. They believe that it only encourages drug abuse, but that's not the case, she said.</p><p>\"Opioid overdoses don't only occur in people using heroin, so patients should talk with their pharmacists about whether they are at risk for overdose and whether they might be a good candidate for having naloxone on hand,\" Puzantian said.</p><p>In the second study, researchers led by Kirk Evoy, a clinical assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin, studied the availability of naloxone at chain pharmacies in the state. Texas also allows pharmacists to provide the drug without a prescription. </p><p>Of the 2,300 drugstores contacted, 84 percent said they would provide the drug, but only 69 percent had it on their shelves. The nasal spray form of the drug was the one most commonly available, the researchers found.</p><p>In drugstores that had the drug in stock and would provide it without a prescription, patients could walk into the pharmacy without having seen a doctor and obtain naloxone the same day in approximately 70 percent of the chain pharmacies contacted, Evoy said. </p><p>Although chain stores like CVS and Walmart stock naloxone, more need to make the drug available, he said.</p><p>\"Hopefully, this study serves as a call to action for community pharmacies to better educate their pharmacists and support staff regarding naloxone access laws and company policies regarding naloxone dispensing,\" Evoy said.</p><p>Dr. Sandeep Kapoor, director of screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment at Northwell Health in New Hyde Park, N.Y., said the public also needs to be educated about naloxone.</p><p>\"We need to encourage education for the community, schools and hospitals to relieve apprehensions one may feel in going directly to a pharmacy to get naloxone,\" said Kapoor, who was not involved with the studies.</p><p>It might be that people feel uncomfortable asking for naloxone because of fear or the stigma associated with opioid use, he said.</p><p>\"We should continue identifying barriers to utilization and focus efforts to further normalize and destigmatize substance use disorder,\" Kapoor said. </p><p>The reports were published Nov. 13 in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/index.html\" target=\"_new\">opioid overdoses</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 20, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is getting serious about added sugars. </p><p>Acting on the health recommendation that calories from added sugars shouldn't exceed 10 percent of your daily total calories, new nutrition labels will break down a food's sugar content so you can read how much added sugar it contains.</p><p>The line for \"sugars\" will become \"total sugars\" and require that the number of \"added sugars\" be declared. This will let you easily see how much of a day's worth of sugar you're eating in every portion, the kind of information we already have about fat, sodium and other nutrients. However, the deadline for manufacturers to include this information has been extended to 2020, so it's still up to you to scrutinize labels for now.</p><p>Sugars added to processed foods aren't physiologically different from the naturally occurring sugars in fruit for instance. But unlike fruit -- and other nutrient-rich foods -- sugary processed foods often lead to overeating. For example, most people don't overdo berries, but do overdo sugar-sweetened drinks, cookies and other desserts. In fact, about half our added sugar intake is from sweetened beverages like soda, energy-, sports- and juice drinks.</p><p>Many used to worry only about tooth decay from sugar. Now we know there's a relationship between excess sugar, weight gain and chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><p>Limiting sugar to 10 percent of daily calories means capping daily intake at 6 teaspoons for women and 9 teaspoons for men. Since current labels do state total sugar content in grams, with a little math, you can get a good idea of how much sugar you're taking in.</p><p>Four grams of sugar roughly equals 1 teaspoon. So just divide the sugar grams in a food portion by 4 to estimate the number of teaspoons it has, then keep a running total each day. And remember that just one can of soda with 40 grams of sugar equals 10 teaspoons -- more than a day's worth.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The University of California, San Francisco program SugarScience has a list of all <a href=\"http://sugarscience.ucsf.edu/hidden-in-plain-sight/#.W1MUOC2ZNsM\" target=\"_new\">ingredient names for sugar</a> to increase your label-reading savvy.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Dec. 5, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- A new mint-sized, battery-free patch that alerts wearers to potentially harmful sunlight exposure in real time might become a powerful weapon in preventing skin cancer.</p><p>Powered by the sun while designed to measure its rays, the patch automatically transmits sun readings to a user's smartphone. It works wet or dry, is fully reusable, and weighs next to nothing.</p><p>\"In the U.S., we're in a skin cancer epidemic, which is driven by excessive UV exposure,\" noted study author Dr. Steve (Shuai) Xu. He is a dermatology instructor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.</p><p>\"Thus, this technology would be useful for the majority of individuals by empowering them to know how much UV they are actually getting,\" he said.</p><p>So, what does it look like and how does it work?</p><p>Xu said the device weighs less than a single tic tac, is half the diameter of a dime, and thinner than a credit card.</p><p>What's more, \"the devices are virtually indestructible,\" said Xu. \"We've washed them, dunked them in boiling water. They will last forever.\"</p><p>As to function, Xu said a solar-powered sensor embedded in the patch picks up UV, infrared and/or visible light readings, sending exposure numbers wirelessly to the wearer's smartphone app.</p><p>Caregivers could also use the patch to monitor blue light phototherapy when treating jaundice (in newborns), psoriasis and/or atopic dermatitis,  Xu explained.</p><p>But the prized benefit is that \"we're able to give actionable, accurate information to the user\" about sun exposure in real time, he noted. In fact, his team's earlier work with a sensor prototype found that nearly two-thirds of patch users got fewer sunburns, while roughly one-third said they wore more sunscreen and looked for more shade.</p><p>\"We're expecting even better results with this sensor,\" Xu said. \"It's more accurate and sensitive than anything else out there.\"</p><p>Xu is also medical director for Northwestern's Center for Bio-Integrated Electronics.</p><p>In the study, two outdoor UV patch trials involving more than 10 participants per experiment were conducted in the sunny locales of Rio de Janeiro and St. Petersburg, Fla. In addition, blue light therapy patch trials were conducted in three babies undergoing neonatal care in a hospital setting.</p><p>The cosmetics company L'Oreal contributed research funding (along with the U.S. National Cancer Institute and the U.S. National Institutes of Health), and has recently launched a UVA-monitoring version of the patch for consumers.</p><p>On the downside, the trials highlighted a \"fundamental limitation\" of the patch: Given that not all parts of the body get the same degree of sun exposure, the small detection area of the patch means that readings may not truly represent sun exposure across the full surface of the body.</p><p>But the results indicated that the patch was easily wearable on those parts of the body that might be of \"critical\" sun exposure interest, including the shoulders and ears. It could even be placed on a pair of sunglasses, the researchers noted.</p><p>The findings were published Dec. 5  in  the journal <i>Science Translational Medicine</i>.</p><p>Arielle Grabel, public relations manager for the Skin Cancer Foundation in New York City, pointed to the foundation's cautionary position statement on the device.</p><p>The foundation \"can't speak to the technology and reliability of these [wearable] devices,\" the statement read. </p><p>The group also warned \"against relying on these devices to determine when to take sun protection measures. Rather, the Skin Cancer Foundation counsels the public to consider sun protection a healthy habit to be practiced daily. This includes seeking shade during peak sun hours, covering up with clothing, hats and sunglasses, and applying sunscreen daily. When spending time outdoors, sunscreen should be reapplied every two hours or immediately after swimming or sweating,\" the statement concluded.</p><p>Each year, there are 5.4 million new cases of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin in the United States, alongside 178,000 new cases of melanoma, resulting in an estimated 9,000 deaths, the investigators noted.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more about sun protection at the <a href=\"https://www.skincancer.org/prevention/sun-protection\" target=\"_new\">Skin Cancer Foundation</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Jan. 7, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- After having a stroke, heart attack or cardiac arrest, people are less likely to be employed than their healthy peers, new research shows.</p><p>Even if they are working, they may earn significantly less than people who haven't had a stroke or heart event, the investigators found.</p><p>Although the majority of people who have one of these serious health scares do end up back at work, about 20 percent of those who had a stroke weren't back at work three years later.</p><p>Meanwhile, about 5 percent of those who had a heart attack hadn't gone back to work, while 13 percent of those who'd had cardiac arrest weren't back on the job after three years. (Cardiac arrest is when your heart suddenly stops beating.) </p><p>The study also found an average drop in yearly earnings of more than $13,000 after a stroke, about $11,000 after cardiac arrest and nearly $4,000 after a heart attack. </p><p>\"When we look at the impact of health events, we need to look not only at short-term, easy-to-measure outcomes like life and death. Quality of life and economic well-being are equally important to people,\" said study author Dr. Allan Garland. He is a professor of medicine and community health sciences at the University of Manitoba and Health Sciences Centre Winnipeg in Canada.</p><p> Garland said that most people want to work, so it's important to figure out who's most likely to lose their ability to work and earn. Then, he added, \"we need policies from government and employers to try to help these people get back to work and be more productive.\"</p><p>Serious health events like heart attacks, cardiac arrest and strokes can be life-altering, the study authors noted. These conditions may lead to a loss in some abilities, which might make it difficult to return to work or to return to work full-time. </p><p>One-third of heart attacks, 40 percent of cardiac arrests and one-quarter of strokes occur in people who are 65  or younger, according to the report. </p><p>To see what impact these events had on people's working lives, the researchers were able to use a Canadian database that links hospital records and tax return information. They looked at data from 2005 to 2013.</p><p>The investigators looked for people who had experienced a heart attack, cardiac arrest or stroke who had been working during the two years before their health event. They were all between the ages of 40 and 61. </p><p>Garland's team compared these groups to a much larger group of similar healthy people, and looked at the three-year period after the serious health event. </p><p>\"These kinds of unemployment and lost earnings have broad consequences across society. In the United States, it can lead to a loss of health insurance and lead to the phenomenon of medical bankruptcy. Those costs are borne by governments and employers,\" Garland said.</p><p>Dr. Terrence Sacchi, chief of cardiology at NewYork-Presbyterian Methodist Hospital in New York City, said that someone who has had a heart attack has a much better chance of returning to work than someone who is much sicker, such as someone who's had a stroke or cardiac arrest.</p><p> Sacchi said the study shows the need to stress prevention. </p><p>\"Modify all the risk factors you can. If you have diabetes, treat it. If you have high blood pressure or high cholesterol, treat it. If you smoke, quit. Eat a healthy diet and exercise to decrease the chances of this happening again,\" he advised. </p><p> Sacchi also recommended that people enter a cardiac rehabilitation program, and \"if you feel you're capable, you can get back to work.\" </p><p>The findings were published Jan. 7 in the <i>CMAJ</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about getting back to work after a stroke from the <a href=\"https://www.stroke.org/we-can-help/survivors/stroke-recovery/life-style/returning-to-work-after-a-stroke\" target=\"_new\">National Stroke Association</a>.</p>",

There was also a slight decline in the percentage of women who drank alcohol during a pregnancy -- about 8.4 percent in 2016, down from 9.6 percent in 2002, the researchers said.</p><p>The rise in marijuana use in pregnancy has been seen in other recent studies, and is troubling, said a research team led by Arpana Agrawal of the department of psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.</p><p>\"Unlike alcohol and cigarette use, prenatal cannabis use has not decreased, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy, which is a key phase of neural [brain] development for the fetus,\" the research team said.  The researchers added that the rise in pot use during pregnancy was relatively similar across various subgroups of women.</p><p>One prior study, published in August in <i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i>, suggested that some pregnant women might be turning to marijuana in hopes of easing morning sickness.</p><p>That study involved more than 220,000 U.S. women. About 5 percent said they'd used cannabis while pregnant, with use rising to more than 11 percent among women who'd complained of severe morning sickness.</p><p>The study was led by Kelly Young-Wolff, a research scientist at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, in Oakland.</p><p>Two obstetrician-gynecologists who weren't involved in either of the two studies said the pot use trends are familiar.</p><p>\"I am not surprised that marijuana use is on the rise among pregnant women,\" said Dr. Adi Davidov, who directs ob-gyn services at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City.</p><p>\"Over the past several years, marijuana use in the general population has been on the rise because of the perceived lack of risk and legalization in certain states,\" he said. \"It would follow that pregnant women would also feel the same way.\"</p><p>Dr. Jennifer Wu practices at Lenox Hill Hospital, also in New York City. She agreed that the rise in pot use during pregnancy is probably due to the fact that more Americans view cannabis as a \"benign drug.\"</p> <p>\"There needs to be better public education on the dangers to the developing fetus,\" said Wu.</p><p>According to Davidov, the effects of marijuana exposure on the developing fetus remain largely unknown.</p><p>\"There are very few studies looking at the true effects of marijuana on pregnancy outcomes,\" he said. \"Until we know the exact outcomes of marijuana use in pregnancy, all pregnant women should be advised to abstain from using it.\"</p><p>The new study was published Nov. 5 in the journal <i>JAMA Pediatrics</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has more on <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Morning-Sickness-Nausea-and-Vomiting-of-Pregnancy\" target=\"_new\">morning sickness</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 7, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Although the herbal supplement kratom is still legal and widely available, its opioid-like effects have caused significant withdrawal symptoms in at least two newborns in the United States and that should raise concerns, researchers say.</p><p>A case study of a baby boy exposed to kratom during his mother's pregnancy -- only the second American case reported -- likely signifies a broader trend among pregnant women toward seeking alternatives to opioid painkillers such as morphine, heroin and oxycodone (OxyContin), said study author Dr. Whitney Eldridge.</p><p>\"I think mothers are becoming increasingly aware of the dangers of using prescription and non-prescription opioids during pregnancy,\" said Eldridge, a neonatologist at Morton Plant Hospital and St. Joseph Women's Hospital, both in Florida.</p><p>\"As opioid use among pregnant women has increased, I fear they may see kratom as a potentially safe, legal, non-opioid alternative aid for opioid withdrawal, as its opioid-like properties are not well-advertised,\" Eldridge added.</p> <p>In February, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration classified compounds in kratom as opioids, basing its findings on a computer analysis showing it activates receptors in the brain that also respond to opioids.</p><p>But controversy over kratom -- which is sold as a dietary supplement, typically to manage pain and boost energy -- remains, as it continues to be sold as a non-opioid remedy for opioid withdrawal. Non-opioid alternatives to treat opioid dependence continue to be researched and scrutinized, experts said.</p><p>The case study, published online Nov. 7 in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i>, centered on a newborn boy whose mother had a seven-year history of oxycodone use, but who had successfully completed drug rehabilitation. She had last used oxycodone two years before her baby was born, and her urine test was negative for drug use.</p><p>Kratom -- which grows naturally in the Southeast Asian countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea and Thailand -- is less potent than morphine and doesn't slow breathing. But 33 hours after his birth, the baby boy in this case study began showing symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal, including sneezing, jitteriness, excessive suck, scratching at the skin around his face, and irritability.</p> <p>His mother denied using prescription medications, supplements or illegal drugs during her pregnancy, but the baby's father reported that the mother drank kratom tea daily during pregnancy. She had bought the tea to help with sleep and her own opioid withdrawal symptoms.</p><p>Treated with morphine and a common blood pressure drug over the next several days, the boy's condition improved and he was discharged from the hospital at 8 days old.</p><p>\"Prior to this case, I was unfamiliar with kratom and unaware of its potential to be a source of withdrawal for [newborn babies],\" Eldridge said. \"After caring for this infant, I started to pay attention to how heavily kratom is advertised and realized pediatricians and obstetricians need to be familiarized with its potential to affect our patients.\"</p><p>Further research is needed to \"make an educated decision as to how to classify kratom,\" she suggested.</p><p>\"It may have a role to play in opioid dependency, [but] currently there is too little data to say what role it should be,\" Eldridge added. \"Meanwhile, pregnant women should disclose kratom use to their physicians just as they would alcohol or tobacco, and physicians have a responsibility to educate pregnant women about the potential impact of kratom for their newborn.\"</p><p>Eldridge's sentiments were echoed by Dr. Martin Chavez, chief of maternal-fetal medicine at NYU Winthrop Hospital in Mineola, N.Y.</p><p>\"I think what hit home most with this case study &hellip; is that we really have to do a thorough job inquiring what type of alternate medications -- whether over-the-counter, holistic or something being provided by a family member -- a pregnant woman may be taking,\" said Chavez.</p><p>\"The most important thing is, just because it's not being prescribed doesn't mean it's not having a potential impact [on the baby],\" he added. \"When in doubt, when you're pregnant or have a newborn, be totally open with your clinician not only about prescription medications, but any other type of medication you may be taking to alleviate symptoms you're having.\"</p> <p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse has  more on <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/kratom\" target=\"_new\">kratom</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 30, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Final exams &ndash; and the ensuing all-night study sessions they cause &ndash; are looming large for many students across the country. But reaching for energy drinks to perk up those drooping eyelids and boost study performance could do more harm than good.</p><p>Recent research shows just one energy drink can affect blood vessel function. And other studies have shown these caffeine-and-herbal concoctions can increase stress hormones and are linked to changes in blood pressure and the heart's electrical activity.</p><p>\"What I say to people who are studying is to avoid energy drinks. And to people who are exercising, avoid them,\" said Dr. John Higgins, chief of cardiology at Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital, a sports cardiologist and a professor at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth in Houston.</p><p>Higgins led a study that looked at the effects of energy drinks on blood vessel function on 44 non-smoking, healthy medical students who were in their 20s. He and his colleagues tested the students' blood vessel, or endothelial, function and then tested it again 90 minutes after they had consumed a 24-ounce energy drink.</p><p>The preliminary results, presented earlier this month at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions conference, suggest the drink reduced by about half how much the participants' blood vessels were able to dilate, or expand.</p><p>\"During exercise or under stress, your arteries have to open up because they need to get blood to the muscles, heart and brain,\" Higgins said. \"If there is impairment during exercise or mental stress, it could lead to adverse effects.\"</p><p>The market for caffeine-infused energy drinks has grown during the last decade, with new blends adding vitamins and other ingredients touting everything from memory enhancement to concentration benefits. According to research company Statista, energy drink sales reached $2.8 billion in 2016, with consistent increases since 2011. A 2016 Statista survey of 18- to 69-year-olds showed 1 in 4 people had an energy drink almost every day.</p><p>Coffee and its caffeine have gotten the green light, in moderation, from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Federal dietary guidelines published every five years as a go-to source for nutrition advice say three to five cups a day, which can be up to 400 milligrams a day of caffeine, can be part of a healthy diet.</p><p>But Higgins said energy drinks are more than just caffeine.</p><p>\"We suspect it has to do with their blends,\" he said. \"They have lots of sugar and caffeine, but also taurine, an amino acid, guaranine (from a South American plant), another source of caffeine, and they sometimes have vitamins. But they have these substances at levels in excess of the recommended daily allowance, sometimes even 10 times or more.\"</p><p>On campus, there's a common pattern, said LaVelle Hendricks, an associate professor of counseling and a student affairs coordinator at Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce, about an hour northeast of Dallas. When students are dealing with stress and lack of sleep, \"when they get close to exam time, they turn to these drinks,\" he said. \"They get this boost of energy, but then they have headaches and they crash. As a way to re-energize and get that same boost, they repeat the cycle.\"</p><p>The tough-but-true advice is there are no shortcuts.</p><p>\"You have to stick to a regimen,\" Hendricks said. \"It entails going to class, studying, eating right, exercising right and getting the proper amount of sleep.\"</p><p>A <em>Journal of American College Health</em> study in 2011 said the consumption of energy drinks has been associated with perceived stress levels of college students. Middlebury College in Vermont banned the on-campus sale of energy drinks. In Britain, many supermarkets have begun banning sales to children under 16, and the government is considering other restrictions.</p><p>Higgins said he'd like more short- and long-term studies that show how these energy drinks &ndash; and their blends of ingredients &ndash; work on the body. So far, the evidence has been inconsistent, he said, with some showing improved performance, some reduced and others no effect.</p><p>Higgins warns that some people are more at risk for the effects from energy drinks, including people under 18; people of small stature; people who don't normally drink caffeine or are sensitive to it; pregnant or breastfeeding women; people taking stimulants for conditions such as attention deficit disorder; and people with certain medical or cardiovascular conditions.</p><p>For a healthy boost during studying, Higgins suggests high-intensity exercise, or even just a quick run up and down the stairs. Getting outside, \"stretching the eyes\" with relaxed nature-watching or a power nap also can help, he said.</p><p>\"If you are really that tired and coffee isn't keeping you awake, you should probably go to sleep. You aren't going to remember anything for the test anyway.\"</p>",

He was eventually seen by Dr. Amy Moore, of Washington University in St. Louis.</p><p>\"My goal with the children with AFM was to restore hip stability, and then motion of the upper legs,\" she told <i>CBS News</i>.</p><p>Fourteen months ago, Moore performed nerve transfer surgery on Brandon's leg at St. Louis Children's Hospital. She said she's the only doctor in the U.S. to perform nerve transfers on children's lower extremities.</p><p>\"I used what they have. They were wiggling their toes, and so I was able to move a nerve that wiggles the toes to the hips,\" Moore told <i>CBS News</i>.</p><p>At a check-up last week, Brandon was walking again.</p><p>The cause of AFM is unknown, but it seems to develop after a viral illness. Nearly 400 people in the U.S. have been diagnosed since 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. So far this year, there have been 80 confirmed cases in 25 states, <i>NBC News</i> reported.</p><p>CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield recently called for a special task force to investigate AFM, which affects about one in a million people.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Soda Makers Using Ballot Measures to Fight Soda Taxes</b></span></p><p>Campaigns supporting ballot measures in Washington and Oregon that would prevent municipalities from taxing food sales are being bankrolled by beverage companies trying to block attempts to tax sugary drinks, a new report suggests.</p><p>Soda taxes are seen as a way to reduce rates of obesity and other health problems linked to high sugar consumption, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, <i>The New York Times</i> reported.</p><p>Nearly 40 countries have them, as do seven cities in the United States, including Philadelphia, San Francisco and Boulder, Col. And other U.S. towns and cities are considering such taxes.</p><p>In response, soda makers like Coca-Cola Co.  and PepsiCo are pushing ballot measures and statewide legislation that would permanently prevent municipalities from taxing a broad range of goods and services. But instead of talking about taxes on soda, the campaigns claim to be fighting taxes on groceries, <i>The Times</i> reported.</p><p>Neither Washington nor Oregon has a plan to tax groceries.</p><p>\"No one is even talking about taxing food,\" Jim Krieger, a professor of medicine and health services at the University of Washington, told <i>The Times</i>. \"This is simply the soda industry trying to protect its profits at the expense of public health and local democracy.\"</p><p>In Washington, the soda industry has spent $20 million to promote the ballot measure opposing such taxes, according to state finance filings. Opponents of the ballot measure have raised $100,000.</p><p>Since last year, legislatures in Michigan, Arizona and California have passed laws that forbid local governments from imposing such taxes in the future. Experts say the outcomes in Oregon and Washington could determine the future of the soda tax movement in the United States.</p><p>\"It's a pivotal moment,\" Mark Pertschuk, director of the advocacy group Grassroots Change, told <i>The Times</i>. \"It's hard to overstate the chilling effect of having soda taxes barred from the whole West Coast, where so many progressive policies are born.\"</p><p>\"These pre-emptive measures undermine democracy and completely take away a local government's ability to do what's best for their communities,\" Jennifer Pomeranz, a professor of public health at New York University, told <i>The Times</i>. \"It's a true corporate takeover of America.\"</p><p>But such ballot measures are by their very nature democratic, according to William Dermody, a spokesman for the American Beverage Association, the industry group backing the measures.</p><p>\"We believe there is a better way to help people reduce the amount of sugar consumed from beverages and bring about lasting change, including working alongside the public health community and offering more low- and no-sugar options,\" he told <i>The Times</i>.</p><p>Studies have found that soda taxes have a significant impact. For example, they reduced soda consumption by 21 percent in Berkeley, Calif. and by 40 percent in Philadelphia.</p><p>\"We know that even modest soda taxes work, Laura MacCleery, policy director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, told <i>The Times</i>. \"Because they work, soda companies fight the taxes tooth and nail.\"</p>",

But because the men went through this process only once, it's not known if the results would be the same over a long-term \"loss and catch-up\" pattern.</p><p>Meanwhile, a study of 447 people done at the University of Pittsburgh found that differences in sleep between weekdays and weekends on a regular basis resulted in higher cholesterol levels, greater insulin resistance, weight gain around the middle and a higher body mass index. And such problems can occur even if the day-to-day sleep imbalances aren't extreme.</p><p>Another study found that these changes can occur in teens, too, putting them at greater risk for diabetes at a young age.</p><p>On a positive note, a much larger study of 2,000 participants of all ages and both genders found that every hour of weekend makeup sleep helped reduce the risk for obesity, which has also been seen as a negative consequence of being sleep deprived. The findings were published in the journal <i>Sleep</i>.</p><p>Until more is learned about catch-up sleep, it's important to heed the warnings about chronic sleep loss and get 7 to 8 hours a night every night.</p><p>Make it a goal to go to bed at roughly the same time every night and wake up at the same time every morning. But when that's not possible, it probably can't hurt to sleep-in on weekend mornings.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The National Sleep Foundation has tips for <a href=\"https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-tools-tips/healthy-sleep-tips\" target=\"_new\">getting better sleep</a>.</p>",

Harsh verbal abuse is also linked to mental health problems in preteens and teens, according to the AAP.</p><p>One study found that children who were spanked more than twice a month at 3 years of age were more aggressive at age 5.

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 30, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Women who live a healthy lifestyle during the transition to menopause may help keep their blood vessels healthy as they age, a new study suggests. </p><p>Compared with women who had the least healthy lifestyle, those who led the healthiest lifestyle had less thickening and buildup of fatty plaque in their arteries, researchers found.</p><p>\"Midlife is a crucial window for women to take their cardiovascular wellness to heart and set a course for healthy aging,\" said study author Dr. Ana Baylin. She's an associate professor of nutritional health sciences and epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.</p><p>The changes that often occur with menopause, especially higher cholesterol levels and blood pressure, can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and reduced mental ability later in life, Baylin said.</p><p>\"The good news is that middle-aged women can take their well-being into their own hands and make healthy lifestyle changes, such as avoiding tobacco smoke, eating a healthier diet and getting more physical activity to reduce their cardiovascular risk,\" Baylin said in an American Heart Association news release.</p><p>For the study, Baylin and her colleagues collected data on more than 1,100 women between ages 42 and 52 who took part in a U.S. National Institute of Aging study and followed them for about 15 years. </p><p>To rate the women's lifestyle, the researchers used a special \"Healthy Lifestyle Score\" developed for the study. Women had an annual medical exam and completed questionnaires about their physical activity, eating habits and tobacco use. The participants also had at least one coronary artery ultrasound, which provided images of the inside of an artery leading to the heart.</p><p>Women with the highest scores -- the healthiest lifestyles -- had less arterial thickening. Of the three score components -- healthy diet, not smoking, and getting regular exercise -- abstinence from smoking had the strongest association with clearer arteries. </p><p>Also, the report found that only about 2 percent of the women stuck to all three parts of the Healthy Lifestyle Score throughout the study.</p><p>\"The low prevalence of a healthy lifestyle in this group of midlife women highlights the potential for lifestyle interventions aimed at this vulnerable population,\" said study co-author Dongqing Wang, also from the University of Michigan.</p><p>\"Our prospective analysis clearly suggests that women approaching menopause can significantly lower this risk if they adopt healthier behaviors, even if cardiovascular issues have never been on their radar,\" he said.</p><p>The report was published online Nov. 28 in the <i>Journal of the American Heart Association</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more information on menopause and heart disease visit the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/consumer-healthcare/menopause-and-heart-disease\" target=\"_new\"> American Heart Association</a>.</p>",

Others were asked to limit their usage to just 10 minutes a day per site, amounting to a total of about 25 minutes per day.</p><p>The result? \"Ours is the first study to establish that reducing social media use actually causes reductions in depression,\" said study author Melissa Hunt. She is the associate director of clinical training in the department of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>\"The main finding of the paper is that limiting your use of Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram to 30 minutes total or less per day results in reductions in depression and loneliness, especially for people who were moderately depressed to start with,\" Hunt said.</p><p>\"Our study cannot speak directly to why this happens,\" she stressed. \"But prior research strongly suggests that negative social comparison -- my life is worse than other people's lives -- and feeling left out of activities and experiences shared by others probably explains a lot of it.\"</p><p>The study team noted that 78 percent of Americans aged 18 to 24 use Snapchat, while more than seven in 10 young adults use Instagram.</p><p>Meanwhile, nearly as many American adults have a Facebook account (68 percent), and three-quarters of those say they use it every day.</p><p>All of the participants were UPenn undergraduates (108 women and 35 men) enrolled in psychology courses. All had an iPhone already loaded with all three site apps.</p><p>Participants first completed a pre-experiment survey to assess their feelings of anxiety, depression, loneliness, fear of missing out (FOMO), sense of social support, sense of self-esteem, and perceptions regarding self-acceptance and autonomy.</p><p>After tracking each participant's normal use of all three sites for a week, the team observed that, for the most part, those struggling with greater mental \"distress\" did not typically spend more time on social media.</p><p>However, those who struggled with FOMO were the exception; they did tend to spend more time using social media.</p><p>The study participants were then  randomly assigned to either unlimited or restricted access for a second week, after which mental health was re-assessed.</p><p>The results suggested that restricting social media use had a \"significant\" and beneficial impact by reducing depressive symptoms, especially among those who had been moderately or highly depressed. Time restrictions also reduced feelings of loneliness.</p><p>But the restrictions had no impact on feelings of social support, self-esteem or one's overall sense of well-being. Whether the findings would also apply to older users remains an open question, the study authors noted.</p><p>While not advocating for a total divorce from all social media, the team acknowledged that identifying the perfect sweet spot for ideal usage habits remains elusive.</p><p>The findings will be published in the December issue of the <i>Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology</i>.</p><p>Dr. Brian Primack is director of the Center for Research on Media, Technology and Health at the University of Pittsburgh.</p><p>He described the findings as \"important,\"  noting that \"because of its experimental design, this study goes an important step further [than prior research] in showing that actively reducing social media use can be helpful.\"</p><p> Primack added that linking a clear mental health benefit to a half-hour of usage per day is a helpful marker.</p><p>\"However, it is important to note that all social media use is not the same,\" said Primack. \"Thirty minutes of use may be spent connecting with loved ones, or it may focus instead on having aggressive interactions about hot-button issues. So, future research might expand findings like this by exploring different contexts of social media use.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on social media use and depression risk at <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/blog/2018/02/does-social-media-depression-in-young-people-really.html/\" target=\"_new\">RAND Corp.</a></p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 30, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Electrical stimulation of a certain part of the brain may offer a new option for \"treatment-resistant\" depression, a small new study suggests.</p><p>Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, found that 25 patients with moderate-to-severe depression gained significant improvement in their mood after electrical stimulation of a brain region called the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC).</p><p>After just three minutes of electrical stimulation to the OFC, even on just one side of the brain, \"patients said things like 'Wow, I feel better,' 'I feel less anxious,' 'I feel calm, cool and collected,'\" UCSF postdoctoral researcher Kristin Sellers said in a university news release.</p><p>\"You could see the improvements in patients' body language,\" she added. \"They smiled, they sat up straighter, they started to speak more quickly and naturally.\"</p><p>The OFC is a small area of the lower surface of the brain, located just above the eyes. It's exact function remains unclear, but study senior author Dr. Eddie Chang explained that the OFC \"is richly connected to various brain structures linked to mood, depression and decision making, making it very well positioned to coordinate activity between emotion and cognition.\" </p><p>Reporting Nov. 29 in <i>Current Biology</i>, the UCSF researchers suggested that the targeted therapy might help patients with treatment-resistant depression, which affects as many as 30 percent of depression patients.</p><p>One neurosurgeon who wasn't involved in the study said brain stimulation therapy for depression isn't new -- and the field has had some setbacks.</p><p>\"Brain stimulation to treat other conditions (such as Parkinson's disease) has been known for decades to have an effect on the mind,\" noted Dr. Michael Schulder. He directs neurosurgery at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y.</p><p>\"Several studies over the last 15 years, in which depressed patients had implanted brain stimulators, initially showed great promise,\" he said. In the final analysis, however, outcomes were not much better than would have been obtained with medication or psychotherapy.</p><p>But could those attempts have been targeting the wrong brain area? Chang's team wanted to find out.</p><p>Their new study involved 25 patients already enrolled in UCSF's epilepsy clinic.  Chang specializes in neurosurgery for people with the seizure disorder.  He explained that as a routine part of these surgeries, patients get electrodes temporarily implanted in their brains to help guide the surgery.</p><p>But in these 25 patients with depression, Chang's group used feedback from the electrodes to track brain activity over several days. They then linked that information to patients' changing moods, thereby pinpointing brain areas that might be amenable to stimulation therapy.</p><p>That led the investigators to the OFC, among other brain areas.  The researchers would deliver a mild electrical current to brain regions and then ask the patients about their emotional state.</p><p>Stimulation to the OFC was the clear \"winner\" here, in terms of a mood boost. What's more, stimulating that area seemed to initiate a larger response within the brain, similar to what happens naturally when a person is feeling positive.</p><p>Also, the therapy seemed to only help patients with moderate-to-severe depression, not those with milder forms of the illness.</p><p>According to study team member Dr. Vikram Rao, this suggests that \"stimulation was helping patients with serious depression experience something like a naturally positive mood state, rather than artificially boosting mood in everyone.\" </p><p>Rao, a UCSF Health neurologist, explained in the news release that prior research had suggested that OFC activity was \"elevated\" in people with depression, so the stimulation might alter the OFC in a healthy way.</p><p>Despite these promising results, the study authors said further research in larger groups of patients is needed to determine whether this therapy produces long-lasting benefits.</p><p>Dr. Vladan Novakovic directs outpatient psychiatry at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City.  He agreed that most work in electrical brain stimulation has focused on a part of the brain's cortex, while leaving other areas, such as the OFC, unexplored.</p><p>Novakovic said the new study is \"commendable for providing real-time, clinically relevant information about the state of OFC and improvement in mood.\"</p><p>For their part, the UCSF team believes that an improved understanding of the OFC's role in depression could lead the way to individualized treatment.</p><p> Heather Dawes, who helped to oversee the research, said, \"The more we understand about depression at this level of brain circuitry, the more options we may have for offering patients effective treatments with a low risk of side effects. Perhaps by understanding how these emotion circuits go wrong in the first place, we can even one day help the brain 'unlearn' depression.\" </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Mental Health has more on <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/depression/index.shtml\" target=\"_new\">depression</a>.</p>",

Over the same time span, the percentage of students who reported suicidal thoughts almost doubled -- from 6 percent to 11 percent. </p><p>And the percentage of students seeking mental health treatment rose from 19 percent to 34 percent, straining college health services coast to coast.</p><p>The most common location for students to get mental health services was on campus, the study found. Nearly 12 percent used campus counseling center services in 2016-17; about 9 percent used other mental health services; and about 1 percent used emergency psychiatric services.</p><p>One reason for the increased patient load: Students reported feeling less stigmatized for seeking help. In 2007, 64 percent said \"most people think less of a person who has received mental health treatment,\" compared to 46 percent in 2017. </p><p>Similarly, 11 percent said in 2007 that they'd \"think less of a person who has received mental health treatment.\" Ten years later, only 6 percent said they felt that way.</p><p>\"The trends revealed in this study have strained counseling centers across the country, as many are under-resourced and operate at full capacity with waitlists for much of the year,\" the study authors wrote.</p><p>In addition to expanding the centers' capacity, increased use of \"preventive and digital mental health services, such as those delivered via mobile apps,\" could help reduce waitlists, the researchers suggested.</p><p>Sarah Ketchen Lipson, an assistant professor of health law, policy and management at the Boston University School of Public Health, led the study.</p><p>It was published online Nov. 5 in the journal <i>Psychiatric Services in Advance</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The National Alliance on Mental Illness has more about <a href=\"https://www.nami.org/Find-Support/Teens-Young-Adults/Managing-a-Mental-Health-Condition-in-College\" target=\"_new\">college students and mental health</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 20, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- People with chronic dry eye may find the condition slows them down when they have to read beyond a couple of paragraphs, a new study suggests.</p><p>Researchers found that compared with people without dry eye, those with the condition read at a slower rate when they were tasked with a 7,200-word passage.</p><p>The study authors said that traditional reading tests given during eye exams -- at around 75 words -- may miss the difficulties that dry eye can cause with prolonged reading.</p><p>Chronic dry eye is common, particularly after the age of 50. Nearly 5 million Americans in that age group have the condition, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO).</p><p>The symptoms of dry eye include burning, redness, stinging or a gritty feeling in the eyes; sensitivity to irritants like wind or cigarette smoke; and excessive tearing, as the eyes some/times overproduce tears in response to the dryness, the AAO noted.</p><p>It's common for people with dry eyes to complain of problems with reading, said researcher Dr. Sezen Karakus.</p><p>But those complaints do not always fit with what's seen during eye exams -- which may suggest the person's vision is fine, explained Karakus, an assistant professor of ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins University.</p><p>So the investigators decided to dig deeper, using a longer reading test developed by one of Karakus' colleagues, Dr. Pradeep Ramulu. It takes about 30 minutes to complete and basically simulates reading a book, Karakus explained.</p><p>The researchers recruited a group of adults older than 50. The group included 116 people with \"clinically significant\" dry eye. That meant they showed certain abnormalities on the cornea -- the transparent surface of the eye -- and differences in tear production.</p><p>Another 39 study participants complained of some dry eye symptoms, but had no abnormal eye exam findings. Finally, 31 people without dry eye signs or symptoms served as a control group.</p><p>On average, the study found, the three groups had similar reading rates on a standard, out-loud reading test. But differences cropped up when they took the silent, prolonged reading test. People with clinical dry eye read at a slower rate -- 240 words per minute, versus 272 per minute in the two other groups.</p><p>Dr. Angie Wen is an ophthalmologist at Mount Sinai's New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, in New York City. She said the findings reflect what she often sees in her practice: Patients who see well on visual exams complain of problems with \"sustained visual tasks\" in daily life.</p><p>Wen noted that the average slowdown on the prolonged reading test could hinder people in the \"real world.\"</p><p>\"It can really make a difference in efficiency in the workplace or enjoyment of leisure reading,\" she said, \"especially in those who have other concurrent eye problems, such as decreased contrast acuity from cataracts.\"</p><p>Fortunately, Karakus said, there are treatments for dry eye. People who notice symptoms can try over-the-counter lubricating eye drops, she said -- but it's best to see an eye doctor for an evaluation.</p><p>In certain cases, Karakus said, an underlying medical condition -- like Sjogren's syndrome or rheumatoid arthritis -- might be the cause. Plus, she added, some people may do better with prescription eye drops or other treatments. For example, doctors sometimes insert tiny \"plugs\" into the tear ducts, to help a person's natural tears stay in the eyes longer.</p><p>In the current study, people with clinical dry eye were asked to stop taking any prescription drops for a month. That was to isolate the effects of dry eye, itself, on their reading, Karakus said.</p><p>So it's possible they would have fared better if they'd been using their prescriptions, she noted.</p><p>Lifestyle changes can also ease dry eye, Karakus said. If you wake up with dry eyes, using a humidifier in the bedroom may be wise. And if you spend a lot of time staring at a computer screen, she recommended taking a break every 20 minutes, to blink 20 times.</p><p>It's known, Wen said, that people blink less when they're at a computer, driving or performing other sustained visual tasks. So dry eye may become an increasing concern, she noted, given how much time people spend on computers and phones.</p><p>The study was published online Nov. 15 in the journal <i>Optometry and Vision Science.</i></p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more about chronic dry eye, visit the <a href=\"https://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/what-is-dry-eye\" target=\"_new\">American Academy of Ophthalmology</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 26, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Millions of American kids with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may have a genetic vulnerability to the disease, a new study suggests.</p><p>Researchers analyzed data from more than 55,000 individuals and identified 12 gene regions linked with ADHD. These regions probably affect the central nervous system, the study authors said.  The discovery might help scientists develop new treatments for ADHD, which affects more than 9 percent of American children.</p><p>\"We all carry genetic risk variants for ADHD,\" explained researcher Anders Borglum, a professor of biomedicine at Aarhus University in Denmark. \"The more we have, the greater our risk for developing ADHD.\"</p><p>Those same genetic areas share a connection with 200 other diseases and traits, he said. The investigators also found that 44 gene variants implicated in ADHD are linked with depression, anorexia and insomnia.</p><p>\"We now understand better why some individuals develop ADHD, and begin to get insights into the underlying biology, paving the way towards new and better treatment of ADHD,\" Borglum added.</p><p>The genetic areas his team uncovered show that this is primarily a brain disorder, Borglum  said.</p><p>The researchers also found genes that may be linked with ADHD have a role in how brain cells interact and also affect speech development, learning and regulation of dopamine (a chemical messenger that carries signals between brain cells).</p><p>Still, the vast majority of ADHD genetics is still undiscovered and will require larger studies, Borglum said. </p><p> Study author Stephen Faraone noted that the team \"found 12 of the very many -- we don't know how many -- probably thousands of genes related to ADHD.\" Faraone is a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, N.Y.  </p><p>The researchers don't expect to discover just one, two or even 10 genes that each have a dramatic effect on causing ADHD and can be used to diagnose the disorder or quickly develop a treatment, he said. Most likely, a combination of genes and environmental factors trigger ADHD, the study authors said. </p><p>Environmental factors may include being born prematurely and underweight or suffering from developmental problems, such as fetal alcohol syndrome, Faraone said. </p><p>Interestingly, he added, even though medications work in treating ADHD, they don't target the genes that the investigators found were linked to the  condition. None of the genes affected by the drugs showed up in their analysis of genes tied to ADHD, Faraone said.</p><p>The report was published online Nov. 26 in the journal <i>Nature Genetics</i>. </p><p> Ronald Brown, dean of the School of Health Sciences at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas, said, \"This is a promising investigation, as it provides further evidence that ADHD is likely an inherited disorder.\" Brown was not involved with the study, but was familiar with the findings.</p><p>It's been clear for years that ADHD runs in families, he said. These findings are also important because they suggest that certain therapies  effective for one family member are likely to be effective for other family members who are diagnosed with ADHD, he added.</p><p>This study is also important because it shows that several psychological disorders are likely tied to these genes, though no cause-and-effect relationship was proven in the study. This information could help families with prevention and early intervention efforts, Brown said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/index.shtml\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. National Institute of Mental Health</a> for more on ADHD.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 27, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- People with disabling back pain may one day receive replacement spinal discs grown from their own stem cells, researchers say.  </p><p>Preliminary results in goats are encouraging, according to the University of Pennsylvania researchers who've been working toward this goal for about 15 years. </p><p>In their latest effort, the team implanted bioengineered spinal discs into goat spines and studied them for up to 20 weeks. The researchers said the new tissue functioned well.</p><p>\"We have every reason to be optimistic that the success will continue, and if it works, we can change the way we think about treating some of these disc diseases,\" said study co-author Dr. Harvey Smith, an associate professor of orthopedic surgery.</p><p>Spinal discs are the soft tissue between the vertebrae that act as cushions. But the discs can wear out. When this happens, the bones of the spine rub against each other and pinch nerves, making movement painful and difficult. </p><p>About half of Americans suffer from back pain at any given time, the researchers noted. It's a leading cause of disability in the United States, with an estimated cost of $195 billion a year. </p><p>For pain caused by a degenerated disc, two treatments currently exist. In one, surgeons remove the damaged disc and fuse together the spinal bones above and below the surgical location. But this causes the other discs to shift, often leading to damage and pain. </p><p>The other surgery involves replacing the damaged disc with one made of plastic, metal or a combination. These replacements wear out over time.</p><p>In the current experiments, scientists developed a method for taking stem cells from goats and growing new tissue on a matrix that resembles a spinal disc.</p><p>When they implanted the engineered discs back into the goats' necks, the discs became a part of the animal's own tissue, the researchers said.  </p><p>MRIs after eight weeks showed the discs maintained or improved their shape, and their function matched or exceeded that of the goat's own cervical disc.</p><p> Senior researcher Robert Mauck said, \"It will be exciting to see how it performs over longer periods, and especially exciting to start providing some hope for these people who are debilitated by the pain they live with every day.\" </p><p>Previously, Mauck, who is a professor of education and research in orthopedic surgery, and his colleagues implanted discs into rat tails and showed they worked over five weeks. </p><p>In the new study, the researchers chose goats because their cervical spine discs (in the neck bones) are about the same size as human discs. Also, the animals often stand on their hind legs, mimicking the disc compression in people.</p><p>Using this technique in humans is still years off, Mauck said. First, the research team must experiment with more goats and keep the implants in longer to see how they fare over time. Only then will the researchers approach the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to see what is needed to start human trials. </p><p> Dr. Qusai Hammouri, an orthopedic surgeon at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City, said, \"This is an exciting development and could have the potential to help many patients with degenerative disc disease.\" </p><p>But Hammouri, who was not involved with the study, pointed out that just because it works in animals doesn't mean it will work in people. \"Many successes in animal models fail to achieve the desired results in humans,\" he said. </p><p>Moreover, the process of back and neck pain isn't completely understood. Most treatments have mixed results and are less successful as more long-term follow-up data becomes available, Hammouri said.</p><p>\"This study could be the first step on the roadway to helping many or just another dead end,\" he said. \"Science and spine surgery history is filled with exciting developments that eventually lead nowhere. Still, it's a great step in the right direction.\"</p><p>The report was published Nov. 21 in the journal <i>Science Translational Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>For more about spinal surgery, visit the <a href=\"https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/treatment/minimally-invasive-spine-surgery/\" target=\"_new\"> American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons</a>.</p>",

But researchers discovered that places in the United States and Europe where germs called mycobacteria are found in abundance in showerheads are  the same places where bacterial lung infections are most common. In America, that includes parts of Southern California, Florida and New York.</p><p>\"We live in a world covered in bacteria, and the bacteria in our showerheads follow some interesting geographic trends, and can be altered by our water source and water chemistry,\" said study lead author Matthew Gebert.</p><p>\"We're exposed to microbes constantly in our day-to-day lives, some beneficial, some innocuous and a few potentially harmful,\" Gebert  explained.</p><p>He's a research associate at the University of Colorado's Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences.</p><p>Bacteria thrive in showerheads and water distribution systems. Although  most of these bacteria are harmless, some can cause lung infections, he said.</p><p>Still, just because mycobacteria live in your showerhead doesn't mean you'll get sick or are more likely to get a respiratory infection, Gebert added.</p><p>In fact, researchers can't say that a person with a respiratory infection got it through showering, but understanding the sources of mycobacterial exposure is important.</p><p>\"We don't want people rushing home and throwing away their showerheads or obsessively cleaning them every day, nor should anyone change their showering habits -- swallowing the water is OK,\" he said.</p><p>For the study, Gebert and his colleagues analyzed showerheads from homes around the United States and Europe, and found an abundance of bacteria. The kind of germs varied by location, and by the chemistry of the water and where it came from.</p><p>An interesting finding was that homes whose water was treated with chlorine disinfectants had high concentrations of certain germs, the researchers noted.</p><p>The study was published recently in the journal <i>mBio</i>. </p><p>\"I don't think there are necessarily any negative implications from the study,\" Gebert said. \"But because bacteria that can cause illness live in our showerheads, it's important to understand how people can be exposed to them.\"</p><p>Dr. Marc Siegel, a professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, noted that bacteria grow in wet places like showerheads.</p><p>\"This is a reminder to clean your showerhead, which nobody does,\" he said, though \"most of us are likely to tolerate mycobacteria and not get sick from it.\"</p><p>Bacteria in showerheads won't cause an outbreak of lung infections, but people who are run down or who have a compromised immune system or a chronic condition may be vulnerable, Siegel suggested.</p><p>Bacteria also live on your toothbrush and in your sink -- any moist surface, he said. </p><p>Siegel recommends cleaning your showerhead every week or two with a disinfectant that contains ammonia to be sure you kill all the germs nesting there. </p><p>\"Add your showerhead to the list of things in the bathroom that need cleaning,\" he said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/mycobacterialinfections.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Library of Medicine</a> for more on mycobacteria.</p>",

Seventy percent believe science positively affects food quality. But about half believe foods with genetically modified (GM) ingredients are worse for your health than non-GM foods.</p><p>On average, women are more concerned than men about health risks from food additives and from GM foods, the findings showed. And people with limited science knowledge worry more about health risks from these foods than those with greater scientific knowledge.</p><p>The 22 percent of Americans who care a lot about GM foods are likely to think they're worse for health, the survey found. They are also the most concerned about health risks from processed foods and controversial farm practices, such as use of hormones or antibiotics in animals, produce grown with pesticides, or foods containing artificial ingredients.</p><p>These food-safety opinions are personal, not political, added Funk, the lead author of the report.</p><p>\"While there are consistent patterns in public beliefs about these food science issues, the divides do not fall along political lines. Instead, people seem to form their own 'food ideologies' about the relationship between health and the foods we eat,\" she explained in a Pew news release.</p><p>Other key findings: </p><ul><li>Nearly one-third of respondents believe meat from animals given antibiotics or hormones, and produce grown with pesticides, pose a great deal of risk to health. </li><li>While pesticides on foods concern 39 percent of women, they worry just 23 percent of men. Likewise, 39 percent of women, versus one-quarter of men, say meat from animals given antibiotics or hormones is risky.</li><li>More than one-quarter of Americans think artificial preservatives are a long-term health risk. More than one in five says the same about artificial dyes. </li><li>Forty-four percent said they restrict consumption of artificial sweeteners and 38 percent limit sugar. One-third limit artificial preservatives, and close to 30 percent watch out for artificial coloring.</li><li>Of those who care about GM foods, two-thirds believe that meat from animals given antibiotics or hormones is a health risk, compared with 12 percent of those who don't care about the issue.</li><li>People who eat more organic foods are more likely to believe food additives are a risk to health.</li><li>Forty-nine percent of Americans believe foods with GM ingredients are worse for health, while 44 percent are neutral on the issue. Five percent say they're better for health.</li><li>Half of people well-versed in science think GM foods are safe and will increase the world food supply.</li><li>Americans' views about organic foods vary by age. Around half of people aged 18 to 49 say organic produce is better for health.

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 8, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- People with type 1 diabetes who use marijuana may double their risk of developing a life-threatening complication, a new study suggests. </p><p>Called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), the condition occurs when there is not enough insulin to break down sugar in the body, so the body burns fat for fuel instead. This triggers a build-up of chemicals known as ketones, which make blood more acidic and can lead to coma or death.</p><p>\"About 30 percent of our patients are using some form of marijuana, and they should be careful when using,\" said study author Dr. Halis Akturk. \"They should be aware of the DKA risk, and recognize the symptoms -- nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and confusion.\"</p><p>Akturk is an assistant professor of medicine and pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes in Aurora, Colo. </p><p>Colorado is one of nine U.S. states that legally allow recreational use of marijuana.</p><p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that develops when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Insulin is a hormone that channels the sugar from foods into the body's cells to be used as fuel. </p><p>People with type 1 diabetes no longer make enough insulin on their own. They must take shots or use an insulin pump to deliver the insulin they need to their bodies. However, getting the dose right is a difficult balancing act. </p><p>Too much insulin can cause dangerous low blood sugar levels that make people shaky, confused and irritable, and if not treated, can cause someone to pass out and possibly to die. </p><p>But too little insulin can lead to high blood sugar levels. Over years, high blood sugar levels can cause the serious complications associated with diabetes, such as heart and kidney disease, vision problems and amputations. Too little insulin can also lead to DKA in as little as a few hours, according to the American Diabetes Association. </p><p>In the new study, the researchers invited adult type 1 diabetes patients at a Colorado hospital to complete a survey on marijuana use. Of 450 survey participants, 134 said they used marijuana. </p><p>The average age of the survey respondents was 39, but among marijuana users it was 31. Cannabis users tended to have lower incomes and education levels. </p><p>Pot users chose to use it in a variety of ways, including smoking, vaping or consuming it in edible products, the investigators found. </p><p>Non-users seemed to have better blood sugar control overall. HbA1C levels -- a blood test that estimates two to three months of blood sugar levels -- were slightly higher in people who used marijuana. </p><p>However, the study only found an association and could not prove a cause-and-effect relationship.</p><p>Dr. Joel Zonszein, director of the clinical diabetes program at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, said, \"I was not surprised that the use of cannabis is associated with DKA. Individuals with type 1 diabetes need to be engaged with their disease and manage insulin dosing constantly, even those on the pump with closed loop systems.\" </p><p>Zonszein said that getting high on marijuana may impair people's ability to give themselves the correct insulin dose. </p><p>\"This study is a warning of the serious and potentially life-threatening 'side effect' of marijuana. This is particularly important due to the ever expanding use of cannabis after its legalization,\" Zonszein  added. </p><p>It's also possible that because marijuana users had lower income and education, an unmeasured factor, such as access to health care or health insurance, may also play a role in raising the risk of DKA, he said. </p><p>The study was published online Nov. 5 as a research letter in <i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about  diabetic ketoacidosis from the <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/complications/ketoacidosis-dka.html\" target=\"_new\">American Diabetes Association</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 9, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Getting the flu may not only make you feel crummy, it also might land you in the hospital for heart problems. </p> <p>A team of researchers analyzed monthly flu reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in four communities across the United States between October 2010 and September 2014. For every 5 percent increase in flu activity, they found that hospitalization rates for heart failure rose by approximately 24 percent in the same month.</p> <p>The findings will be presented Saturday during the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions conference in Chicago. </p> <p>\"Influenza can influence cardiovascular events especially in high-risk individuals, so we should not be complacent about vaccination,\" said Dr. Scott Solomon, the study's senior author and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. \"The single best way to improve influenza-related outcomes is to vaccinate people.\"</p> <p>Research earlier this year found that people were six times more likely to have a heart attack in the week after being diagnosed with the flu. But the impact of the virus on heart failure, a condition in which the heart muscle becomes too weak or stiff to pump blood efficiently through the body, hasn't been as clear, Solomon said.</p> <p>\"The goal of this study was really to look at whether we could relate influenza activity occurring regionally and temporarily, or at a particular time of the year, with heart failure hospitalizations that were occurring around the same time,\" he said. </p> <p>Donna Arnett, an epidemiologist and dean of the University of Kentucky College of Public Health, who was not involved in the new research, said the increased risk of heart failure hospitalization found in the study was small but significant enough to send a message.</p> <p>\"The biggest takeaway here is that people who already have heart disease and may be susceptible to heart failure should definitely be vaccinated because influenza is, for the most part, preventable with vaccination,\" she said. </p> <p>The mechanics behind how the flu actually contributes to heart failure is unclear, but Arnett said that's not \"as relevant as what we already know about preventing influenza.\"</p> <p>\"From my perspective as an epidemiologist, we have a vaccine to prevent the disease. We should employ that vaccine as widely as possible, particularly for those who are susceptible to heart failure,\" she said. </p> <p>Flu activity in the U.S. usually begins in October or November, peaks between December and February, and can last as late as May, according to the CDC. Each year in the U.S., the flu is estimated to cause between 12,000 and 56,000 deaths and up to 710,000 hospitalizations.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 14, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Contrary to common belief, blood pressure doesn't have to rise as you age, a study of two remote South American tribes suggests.  </p><p>Looking at the isolated Yanomami tribe in the Venezuelan rainforest, researchers found their blood pressure remained low from youth to age 60.</p><p>That's probably because as hunter-gatherer-gardeners, they don't eat the processed and salted foods common in the so-called Western diet, the researchers said in a new report.</p><p>\"The association between age and blood pressure may not be driven by age itself, but rather the cumulative effects of a Western lifestyle and dietary practices,\" said lead researcher Noel Mueller, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health.</p><p>Another local tribe, the Yekwana, had some access to Western-style foods, and their blood pressure started increasing in childhood, said Mueller.</p><p>\"We believe that rising blood pressure is due to the consumption of processed foods and salt,\" he said. This is what the report refers to as \"unnatural Western exposures.\"</p><p>About 1 in 3 American adults has high blood pressure, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Left untreated, high blood pressure, or hypertension, can lead to heart attack, stroke, sexual dysfunction and other health problems.</p><p>Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a professor of cardiology at Yale University, was enthusiastic about the new findings.</p><p>\"This small study introduces a remarkably powerful idea -- that an increase in blood pressure with age is not inevitable,\" said Krumholz, who wasn't involved with the study.</p><p>It is entirely plausible that a healthy lifestyle could protect against the growing risk of hardening of the arteries with increasing age that is so prevalent in Westernized societies, he said.</p><p>Over five months, Mueller and his team measured the blood pressure of 72 Yanomami and 83 Yekwana members who were between 1 and 60 years old. </p><p>The Yekwana are less isolated than the Yanomami. Because of missions and an airstrip, the Yekwana have some contact with the outside world, including Western-style eating, the researchers noted. </p><p>The study found no age-related increase in blood pressure among the children and adults of the Yanomami. But among the Yekwana, blood pressure began increasing in childhood and went up about 0.25 mm Hg a year on average, Mueller said. </p><p>The Yanomami diet consists of fruits, vegetables and meats from the animals they hunt. Fiber and carbohydrates make up the bulk of their diet, however. \"No salt and no added sugar,\" Mueller said. </p><p>Keeping blood pressure low is key to preventing cardiovascular disease, Mueller said, adding that age-related blood pressure spikes shouldn't be taken for granted.</p><p>\"We can prevent it with interventions that reduce the intake of salt in our diet,\" he said.</p> <p>Life deep in the isolated rainforest isn't all rosy, however. Mueller acknowledged that the Yanomami life span is shorter than that in developed countries because they lack access to antibiotics and other medicines that could prevent or cure infections and diseases. </p><p>Warring with other tribes also shortens their lives, Mueller said.</p><p>The study can't prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship. Still, \"it is worth studying whether the effect of age on our vascular system can be slowed, stopped or even reversed with a healthy lifestyle -- and what particular elements of a healthy lifestyle might make the most difference,\" Krumholz said.</p> <p>As to whether salt is to blame for blood pressure rising with age, Krumholz isn't sure. </p><p>\"There are so many ways that modern society is different from the era in which cardiac disease was rare,\" Krumholz said. </p><p>Differences in dietary, behavioral and environmental exposures make it hard to pinpoint the exact cause of these blood pressure discrepancies, he said. \"It is likely, in the end, to be a result of the combination of factors,\" Krumholz noted.</p><p>The report was published online Nov. 14 in <i>JAMA Cardiology</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>To learn more about healthy blood pressure, visit the <a href=\" https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2016/01/blood-pressure-matters\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institutes of Health</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 26, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Keeping type 1 diabetes under tight control through medication may help prevent people with the disease from developing an immune reaction to their own bodies, one that specifically attacks the heart, according to new research.</p> <p>Type 1 diabetes is the less common form of the disease that affects the way the body regulates blood sugar, or glucose. People who have type 1 diabetes are unable to produce adequate insulin, a hormone that controls glucose levels. That's because the body's immune system mistakenly attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.</p> <p>A similar process appears to be delayed but happens to the heart muscle of patients with type 1 diabetes whose blood sugar isn't under close control, according to a Harvard-led study published Nov. 26 in the American Heart Association's journal <i>Circulation</i>.</p> <p>People with type 1 diabetes have a higher risk of developing heart disease than the general population, but the reason why hasn't been clearly understood, said Dr. Myra Lipes, the study's senior author and an investigator at Harvard Medical School's Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston.</p> <p>Lipes and other researchers looked at data from a broad clinical trial involving type 1 diabetes patients who were randomly split into two groups.</p> <p>People in one group tightly controlled their blood sugar levels with intensive insulin treatment and frequent glucose monitoring, while those in the other were looser with their regulation and had higher blood sugars. At the start of the experiment, participants were free of heart disease and had regular blood pressure and cholesterol levels. They also did not have eye or kidney problems that are common long-term complications of type 1 diabetes.</p> <p>Researchers found that people exposed to higher blood sugar levels were more likely to develop an autoimmune response to the heart proteins that was linked to later development of heart disease, including calcium buildup in heart arteries, heart attack, bypass surgery and death.</p> <p>\"It wasn't something in the blood itself that triggered this reaction,\" Lipes said. \"It's that the high glucose levels injure the heart muscle tissue, and we postulate that the immune system of people with type 1 diabetes overreacts to this heart injury.\"</p> <p>It's a response that does not occur in type 2 diabetes patients with similarly high glucose levels, she said.</p> <p>But these heart-damaging complications happened many years, even decades, after the autoimmune responses developed, Lipes said. She added that more research is needed to help pinpoint the specific biological reasons responsible for this process.</p> <p>That eventually could help identify which patients are at the highest risk for heart attacks and other heart-related health problems. And ultimately, it could lead to new ways to prevent heart disease, Lipes said.</p> <p>About 5 percent of all people with diabetes have type 1, which is controlled by replacing missing insulin through regular injections or an insulin pump. People with type 2 diabetes also have problems controlling their insulin, but not because of antibodies that destroy insulin-producing cells.</p> <p>Instead, it's often because years of poor diet, lack of regular exercise and excess weight have made their bodies unable to secrete enough insulin to keep up with demand or to use insulin effectively.</p> <p>People with both types of diabetes are known to be at higher risk for heart disease, just for different reasons.</p> <p>The study points out that the difference for patients with type 1 diabetes may stem from the creation of antibodies that attack the heart, said endocrinologist Dr. Robert H. Eckel, a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado.</p> <p>\"They don't occur in everybody, but the control of the diabetes relates to the formation of these antibodies against heart proteins,\" said Eckel, who was not involved in the study. \"In type 2 diabetes, you just don't see these antibodies being developed.\"</p> <p>The study stresses the importance for patients with type 1 diabetes to keep their condition under control, he said.</p> <p>\"First of all, control your diabetes to prevent losing your eyesight, to prevent your kidneys from failing, and also to keep your nerves functioning normally,\" he said. \"But now, we know that better control of your blood sugar seems to prevent this autoimmunity against the heart from occurring.\"</p>",

It even estimates their annual risk of stroke.</p><p>The pop-up then requires doctors to either prescribe a blood thinner or give a reason why such a medicine shouldn't be used. Possible reasons include \"bleeding risk is too high,\" \"patient is at high risk for falls,\" or \"patient refuses anticoagulation.\"</p><p>To see whether the alert would make a difference, the researchers randomly assigned 458 a-fib patients so about half would have their records reviewed by the program.</p><p>About 19 percent of patients in the alert group had a prescription for blood thinners during hospitalization, at discharge and three months later, researchers found. By comparison, only 7 percent of the control group had been prescribed blood thinners.</p><p>By three months after hospitalization, the alert group had a dramatic effect on patients' odds for heart attack or stroke, although that didn't translate to a lessening of the death rate, the team noted.</p><p>Still, the study showed that reminder systems like this actually really work to cut the odds for cardiac events, said Walsh, who is president of the American College of Cardiology.</p><p>\"We as physicians can't keep everything in our brains all the time,\" she said. \"It's clear in medicine if we have reminders, we more commonly prescribe drugs and take action.\"</p><p>But even though doctors are moving toward the use of electronic health records, it's not clear how easily hospital data centers could incorporate such an alert into their usual systems, Walsh said.</p><p>\"All electronic health records could do it probably, but not all are set up to do it,\" Walsh said. \"I can tell you, my electronic health record doesn't do this kind of thing. It's not an automatic thing that happens.\"</p><p>Adding such an alert system might be costly for some hospitals, Piazza added.</p><p>\"Implementation of alert-based [computerized decision support] requires an investment in programming and medical informatics infrastructure which may not be available at some medical centers,\" Piazza said.</p><p>Experts note that findings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on atrial fibrillation, visit the <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/atrial-fibrillation/what-is-atrial-fibrillation-afib-or-af\" target=\"_new\">American Heart Association</a>.</p>",
