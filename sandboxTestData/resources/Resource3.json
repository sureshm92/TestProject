More specifically, they assessed how a mother's habit influenced the age at which her children started using the drug. They also considered the children's behavior, mental abilities, social environment and family income.</p><p>The report showed that roughly 67 percent of the children and 35 percent of the mothers reported being marijuana users.</p><p>The researchers also found the kids whose mothers used the drug were more likely to try it themselves at a median age of 16. In comparison, the children of women who didn't use marijuana began using the drug at the age of 18. The researchers noted this link was more notable among white children.</p><p>The report was published Sept. 24 in the <i>American Journal of Preventive Medicine</i>. </p><p>Marijuana use among children and teens is linked to problems with attention, concentration, decision-making and working memory. Young people may experience prolonged impulsivity for weeks after using the drug and reductions in IQ, anxiety, symptoms of depression and other thinking problems that last into adulthood, the researchers said.</p><p>That's not to say there aren't benefits associated with marijuana use, Sokol noted.</p><p>\"Cannabis has recognized therapeutic benefits for treating a number of different medical conditions. There is also evidence that the availability of legal medical and recreational cannabis may reduce population opioid overdose deaths,\" Sokol said in a journal news release.</p><p>\"For these reasons, total cannabis prohibition may not be consistent with public health objectives,\" she said.

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Oct. 25, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- A new gene therapy might help improve motor symptoms in people with Parkinson's disease who aren't responding to other therapies, an early study has found. </p><p>\"This is not a cure of Parkinson's disease,\" said James Beck, chief scientific officer of the Parkinson's Foundation. \"This is a potentially good treatment for symptom control. It provides an additional way of providing dopamine to the brain, but it doesn't stop the progression of Parkinson's disease.\"</p><p>The new treatment uses a virus to deliver gene therapy to a targeted area of the brain. The gene therapy affects an enzyme called AADC. This enzyme transforms levodopa into dopamine in the brain. </p><p>Cells that make the neurotransmitter dopamine -- a chemical messenger in the brain -- die off in Parkinson's disease, according to the U.S. National Institute on Aging. A loss of dopamine causes the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as tremor and slow movements. </p><p>Standard treatments attempt to replace the lost dopamine. For example, one current medication is levodopa, but the cells that transform levodopa into dopamine have to be functioning for this treatment to work. As the dopamine-producing cells die off, it becomes harder and harder for the brain to respond to medications like this, Beck explained.</p><p>And, that's where the new gene treatment may help. </p><p>Led by Dr. Chadwick Christine, at the University of California, San Francisco, researchers used MRI scanning to locate the right area of the brain. Then they infused the new gene therapy into a targeted area of the brain called the putamen. The study team chose this area because these brain cells aren't destroyed by Parkinson's disease. </p><p>The phase 1 trial included 15 people who were no longer responding to other Parkinson's treatments. They all received one infusion of the gene therapy -- known as VY-AADC. </p><p>After the treatment, researchers followed the patients' health for up to 36 months and found that the treatment was well-tolerated. The most serious side effects -- a blood clot and an irregular heart rhythm caused by the blood clot -- were related to the surgery used to deliver the treatment, and not the treatment itself, the researchers said. </p><p>The therapy also showed a meaningful improvement in the time people spent without movement symptoms each day. And the effect appeared to be lasting, with some of the patients followed for as long as three years. </p><p>Dr. Alessandro Di Rocco, director of the Movement Disorders Program at Northwell Health in Great Neck, N.Y., reviewed the findings. </p><p>\"This study seems to be a step forward in perfecting the [gene therapy] vector and they were able to give it safely,\" he said.</p><p> Di Rocco added that the decrease in symptoms \"is a real effect.\"</p><p>But, like Beck, he cautioned that this is an early study with only a small number of people in the trial. Di Rocco also noted that the trial wasn't \"blinded,\" so it's possible there was a placebo effect for some. </p><p>Both Di Rocco and Beck also expressed concern about the possible cost of such therapy. </p><p>The University of California, San Francisco, and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center researchers aren't the only team working on gene therapy for Parkinson's symptoms. A group of British researchers is actively recruiting Parkinson's patients to take part in a gene therapy trial that's also aimed at increasing the availability of dopamine in the brain. </p><p>Their trial will look at up to 30 patients receiving treatment in London or Paris. For this study, researchers are targeting a part of the brain called the striatum. </p><p>Results of the American study were presented Sunday at the American Neurological Association meeting, in Atlanta. Findings presented at meetings should be viewed as preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about Parkinson's disease treatments from the <a href=\"https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/treatment\" target=\"_new\">Parkinson's Foundation</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 7, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Untreatable, antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea has become a chilling prospect in the United States, raising concerns that people might someday have to live with the sexually transmitted bacteria.</p><p>But now there's reason for hope. A newly developed antibiotic pill has proven effective against gonorrhea in early clinical trials.</p><p>Zoliflodacin proved effective in treating gonorrhea infections of the urinary and genital tracts and rectum, researchers say.</p><p>\"Gonorrhea has become resistant to every antibiotic that has ever been used for it, so right now we're down to our last class of antibiotics that can be used,\" said lead researcher Dr. Stephanie Taylor, an infectious disease specialist in New Orleans.</p><p>\"This is very, very encouraging as a potential new antibiotic,\" added Taylor, medical director of the Louisiana State University-CrescentCare Sexual Health Center. </p><p>The study results are published in the Nov. 8 <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p>Gonorrhea rates have risen dramatically in recent years in the United States.</p><p>More than 555,600 cases were reported nationally in 2017, an 18 percent increase over the previous year, said Dr. Susan Blank, assistant commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. And between 2013 and 2017, gonorrhea rates increased 67 percent.</p><p>\"It's a swiftly increasing infection in the United States,\" Blank said. \"We are seeing some pretty steep increases. It's rarely fatal, but it can really profoundly impact quality of life.\"</p><p>Currently, people with gonorrhea are treated with an injection of ceftriaxone, the only antibiotic still effective against the bacteria, Taylor said.</p><p>\"We know gonorrhea has an incredible capacity to develop resistance to antibiotics,\" Blank said. \"Where we are right now, untreatable gonorrhea is a real possibility.\"</p><p>Untreated gonorrhea can cause sterility in people, as well as pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and destructive arthritis, Blank said. Babies exposed to gonorrhea by infected mothers can be stricken blind.</p><p>\"Gonorrhea also facilitates significantly the transmission of HIV infection between sex partners,\" said Blank, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new trial results.</p><p>In this clinical trial with 141 participants, zoliflodacin proved nearly as effective as ceftriaxone. </p><p>Zoliflodacin cured 96 percent of genital and urinary tract infections and 100 percent of rectal infections, compared with ceftriaxone's 100 percent effectiveness, the researchers reported.</p><p>The new antibiotic struggled against gonorrhea infections in the throat, with a higher 3-gram dose clearing only 82 percent of infections compared with 100 percent effectiveness from ceftriaxone.</p><p>\"That historically has been the way gonorrhea of the throat has reacted,\" Taylor said. \"It's always been difficult to treat.\"</p><p>The most common side effects were gastrointestinal, and none required patients to go off the new medication, Taylor said. One limitation was that only 12 women participated in the trial.</p><p>This was the second of three clinical trials needed for U.S. approval of zoliflodacin. Phase 3 trials will start next year, Taylor said. If those trials go well, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would have data on hand to evaluate and approve the antibiotic by 2020. The agency already has granted the antibiotic a \"fast track\" designation.</p><p>Although the development of zoliflodacin is encouraging, more antibiotics must be developed to keep countering gonorrhea and other antibiotic-resistant germs, Taylor and Blank said.</p><p>\"Even if this antibiotic were perfect, we know gonorrhea will outsmart it,\" Blank said. \"We need things in the back pocket. We don't know how quickly it will outsmart it.\"</p><p>Doctors and public health officials also must continue efforts to detect and treat gonorrhea, Blank said. People who are sexually active need to use condoms to prevent transmission of gonorrhea, which disproportionately spreads among blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans, she noted.</p><p>\"Controlling gonorrhea in a population requires a whole bunch of connected activities,\" Blank said.</p><p>The clinical trial was funded in part by zoliflodacin's co-developer Entasis Therapeutics, a spinoff of AstraZeneca.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/STDFact-gonorrhea.htm\" target=\"_new\">gonorrhea</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 20, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The advent of the e-cigarette appears to have spurred a huge drop in tobacco smoking rates among teenagers and young adults, a new study claims.</p> <p>Previous research has argued that vaping could prove to be a gateway drug for smoking, by getting youngsters hooked on nicotine and used to the physical actions associated with smoking.</p><p>Instead, smoking among teens dropped off dramatically after e-cigarette use became more widespread in 2013, said lead researcher David Levy. He is a professor with the Georgetown University Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, in Washington, D.C.</p><p>\"The rate of decline in cigarette use tripled,\" said Levy.</p><p>The new findings come days after U.S. regulators pledged to strengthen policies that prevent the sale of flavored vaping products to minors.</p><p>\"I will not allow a generation of children to become addicted to nicotine through e-cigarettes,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a U.S. Food and Drug Administration statement. \"We won't let this pool of kids, a pool of future potential smokers, of future disease and death, to continue to build.\"</p><p>For the new study, Levy and his colleagues analyzed responses to five different national surveys that track tobacco use.</p><p>The surveys showed that, prior to 2013, cigarette smoking was gradually declining among young people between the ages of 15 and 25, the researchers reported.</p><p>But after 2013, that gradual decline turned into a steep decline. The annual relative reduction in smoking tripled among 10th and 12th graders, the investigators found.</p><p>Why? Levy and his colleagues suggested that, in part, it's because vaping became popular.</p><p>Past 30-day vaping among high school students increased from 1.5 percent in 2011 to 4.5 percent in 2013, and to 13.4 percent in 2014.</p><p>\"When e-cigarette use came in, smoking rates dropped between 25 and 40 percent,\" Levy said. \"Smoking rates in young adults have dropped by almost 50 percent, and most of that [has been] since 2013.\"</p><p>Levy said he's worried that tough e-cigarette regulations could reverse those trends.</p><p>\"My concern is if we have very strict policies on e-cigarettes, it's kind of like throwing out the baby with the bathwater,\" Levy said. \"We might see more smoking.\"</p><p>But Patricia Folan, director of the Northwell Health Center for Tobacco Control in Great Neck, N.Y., said the new report gives vaping too much credit for the decline in tobacco use among young people.</p><p>\"Anti-tobacco media campaigns, increasing taxes on cigarettes, tobacco-free environments, the removal of cigarettes and other tobacco products from some pharmacies and other retail stores, as well as efforts to restrict and reduce point-of-sale advertising have all contributed to a reduction of smoking among teens and adults,\" Folan said.</p><p>Levy agreed that these measures have played a part, but argued that \"of the between 25 and 50 percent drop in smoking rates, maybe 10 percent might be explained by other policies.\"</p><p>In fact, the availability of e-cigarettes might make other anti-smoking efforts more effective, Levy added.</p><p>\"Those other policies probably have become a lot more powerful as a result of e-cigarettes being there as a substitute for cigarettes,\" he said.</p><p>But Folan noted that even if young people are vaping rather than smoking, they're still being exposed to nicotine.</p><p>\"Vaping is often perceived as a healthy alternative for teens and adults,\" she said. \"However, for teens the exposure to nicotine can have an adverse effect on the developing brain and lead to lifelong addiction.\"</p><p>It also shouldn't be assumed that e-cigarettes are harmless, said Dr. Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialist with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. The vapor inhaled by users contains a wide array of chemicals.</p><p>\"This is not a non-toxic thing to do, just because it's not burning paper and burning tobacco,\" Horovitz said. \"There's nothing OK about vaping.\"</p><p>The study was published online Nov. 20 in the journal <i>Tobacco Control</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has more about <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm625884.htm\" target=\"_new\">upcoming e-cigarette regulations</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 21, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- When young children have a bout of \"stomach flu,\" parents often turn to probiotics for help. But two new clinical trials suggest they are wasting their money.</p><p>Researchers found that probiotic formulas showed no benefit for babies and preschoolers with acute gastroenteritis -- a common gut infection that causes diarrhea and vomiting.</p><p>The findings contradict some earlier, smaller trials.</p><p>But researchers said those studies were generally \"poorly done\" and provided only weak evidence that probiotics worked.</p><p>The new trials, performed in Canada and the United States, were much better designed, said Dr. J. Thomas LaMont, a gastroenterologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.</p><p>And the findings might change doctors' minds about suggesting probiotics for gastroenteritis, he said.</p><p>\"Often, trials with negative findings don't get published,\" said LaMont. \"These trials were published because they're expected to have an impact on clinical practice.\"</p><p>LaMont wrote an editorial accompanying the reports, which were published Nov. 22 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p>Probiotic supplements contain live bacteria, the goal being to restore a better balance to intestinal bacteria and boost the immune system.</p><p>Despite the weak evidence, some medical societies do suggest probiotics as an option for kids' gastroenteritis -- partly because the products are considered quite safe.</p><p>So doctors do recommend them, and many parents try the heavily marketed products on their own, said Dr. David Schnadower, who worked on both trials.</p><p>As it stands, there is no way to stop the diarrhea caused by gastroenteritis, said Schnadower, a professor of pediatrics at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. The only treatments are fluids to prevent dehydration and, sometimes, anti-nausea medication.</p><p>\"That's frustrating,\" Schnadower said. \"Parents really want something to make this go away.\"</p><p>But based on the new findings, he said, probiotics are not the answer.</p><p>The U.S. trial tested a pediatric formulation of a probiotic marketed for \"digestive health\" called <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG</i>, or LGG.</p><p>It included 971 children aged 3 months to 4 years who'd been diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis in an emergency room. The researchers randomly assigned them to receive either a five-day course of LGG or a placebo, in addition to standard care.</p><p>In the end, the study found, the probiotic made no difference. Children in both groups had diarrhea for an average of two days, and missed two days in day care.</p><p>Schnadower said his team looked at the findings from different angles -- including whether probiotics had different effects in kids who did or didn't get antibiotics, or whose infections were caused by a virus versus bacteria.</p><p>\"No matter how we looked at it,\" he said, \"probiotics were no better than placebo.\"</p><p>The Canadian study tested a probiotic combination -- <i>L. rhamnosus</i> plus <i>L. helveticus</i> -- in 886 children with acute gastroenteritis. The results were nearly identical to those from the U.S. trial.</p><p>None of that means probiotics are useless, according to LaMont. He pointed to a recent trial in rural India, where researchers gave newborns a probiotic or placebo for the first few days of life. The supplement lowered the babies' risk of lung infections and sepsis -- a severe complication of infection -- in the first two months of life.</p><p>But when it comes to acute gastroenteritis, LaMont said, probiotics may have no effect because kids' symptoms are usually short-lived anyway.</p><p>\"These conditions get better on their own in about 48 hours,\" he said. \"They're self-limiting.\"</p><p>Schnadower suggested that parents stick with some basic measures when a child has diarrhea and vomiting.</p><p>\"Keep your child well-hydrated with fluids,\" he said, \"and wash your hands regularly to lower the risk of spreading the infection.\"</p><p>And while probiotics are generally safe, Schnadower pointed to the cost.</p><p>\"Is it worth spending money on a probiotic that's no better than a placebo?\" he said. \"You could spend it on fruits and vegetables and other nutritious foods instead.\"</p><p>Schnadower did stress that there's great promise in studying the \"microbiome\" -- the trillions of bacteria and other microbes that naturally dwell in the body and may play a key role in our health.</p><p>\"But research into manipulating the microbiome for health is still in its infancy,\" Schnadower said. \"The market for probiotics is huge, and it's growing much faster than the science supporting it.\"</p><p>He cited statistics showing the global market stands at about $37 billion.</p><p>In the United States, LaMont noted, probiotics are not regulated the way drugs are. They are considered supplements and do not have to be proven effective before hitting store shelves.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institutes of Health has more on <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/viral-gastroenteritis\" target=\"_new\">gastroenteritis</a>.</p>",

She's an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania's School for Communication.</p><p>\"When people are reminded that it's better to park the car farther away and get in a few more steps, or to get up and move around at work to lower their risk for heart disease, they often come up with reasons why these suggestions might be relevant for somebody else, but not for them,\" Falk said in a university news release.</p><p>The new study found that people who were prompted to either think about others, or to have spiritual thoughts, were more likely to become more physically active. </p><p>The study included 220 sedentary adults who were overweight or obese. Participants were placed into one of two  so-called \"self-transcendence\" groups, or a \"control\" group. </p><p>One of these groups was asked to think about values bigger than themselves, such as their loved ones or their connection with God or another higher power, while in an MRI machine.</p><p>Another group was asked to make positive wishes for people they knew and for strangers. These included hopes that their friends would be happy or that others would be well.</p><p> Meanwhile, a third group -- the  \"neutral control thoughts\" group --  was instructed to think about their least important values. </p><p>The study participants then saw health messages that urged them to increase physical activity and explained why their current behaviors jeopardized their health.</p><p>In the following month, participants received daily text messages that repeated the experiment in miniature, reminding them of the self-transcendence thoughts, or the neutral control thoughts from the study. All of the participants also wore fitness trackers to monitor their activity.</p><p>Compared with the \"neutral thoughts\"  group, people who completed the self-transcendence tasks were significantly more active in the month that followed, the researchers found.</p><p>In addition, they showed more activity in brain areas involved in reward and positive feelings.</p><p> Lead author Yoona Kang pointed out that \"people often report that self-transcendence is an intrinsically rewarding experience. When you are having concerns for others, these can be rewarding moments.\" Kang is a postdoctoral fellow at the university's  School for Communications. </p><p>People are capable of doing things for their loved ones that they would never do for themselves, she said. \"The idea of self-transcendence -- caring for others beyond one's own self-interest -- is a potentially powerful source of change,\" she added.</p><p>The study was published online Sept. 17 in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on healthy living, visit the <a href=\"https://healthfinder.gov/HealthTopics/Category/everyday-healthy-living\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a>.</p>",

Now, new research suggests that's true for the latest form of the drug, as well.</p><p>Scientists say the protective effect of the newer pills -- which contain lower doses of estrogens and different progestogens -- rose over time and persisted for several years after women stopped taking them.</p><p>\"Based on our results, contemporary combined hormonal contraceptives are still associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer in women of reproductive age,\" conclude a team led byDr Lisa Iversen, a researcher at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.</p><p>The study wasn't able to prove cause-and-effect. However, Iversen's group pointed to prior research that found that women who took the older forms of oral contraceptives tended to have a lower risk for ovarian cancer.</p><p>But would the same benefit apply to newer pills, with different combinations and levels of hormones?</p><p>To find out, the team examined the effects of newer hormonal contraceptives with combined hormones, as well as progestogen-only products, on the risk for ovarian cancer among young women.</p><p>Overall, they tracked data on nearly 1.9 million Danish women between the ages of 15 and 49. The data came from national prescribing and cancer registers compiled between 1995 and 2014.</p><p>The women were divided into three groups: those who never used hormonal birth control pills, those who currently use them or did so recently for up to one year, and former users who took the pills for more than a year.</p><p>The study, published Sept. 26 in the <i>BMJ</i>, showed that 86 percent of the women took combined birth control pills.</p><p>After factoring in the women's age and other variables, the researchers found that ovarian cancer was most prevalent among the women who had never used birth control pills.</p><p>Also, the number of cases of ovarian cancer were dramatically lower among women who had used birth control pills that contained both estrogen and progestogen at some point.</p> <p>A similar protective effect was <i>not</i> found among women who took pills that only contained progestogen.</p><p>Overall, if the Pill does help prevent ovarian cancer, the study authors now estimate that use of the meds prevented 21 percent of ovarian cancers in this group of Danish women.</p><p>One U.S. expert wasn't overly surprised by the findings.</p><p>In prior studies, \"patients who use oral contraceptives for extended periods of time have been found to have significantly lower ovarian cancer risks,\" said Dr. Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician/gynecologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>The new study just reaffirms that potential benefit for newer-generation pills, she said.</p><p>Ovarian cancer is often not detected until it has spread, making it once of the deadliest cancers.  That's why anything that might prevent the disease in the first place is so important, Wu said.</p><p>\"Ovarian cancer has such a delayed time to diagnosis and such poor long-term survival that prevention is essential,\" Wu said.

Over time the smoke weakens the lungs, forcing the heart to work harder, and more inefficiently, to pump blood through the body. Studies have found that smokers are more likely to die from heart disease than from lung cancer.</p> <p>Researchers in this new study looked at data for 6,842 smokers who had CT scans of their lungs, images that also include detailed pictures of their heart. They measured coronary artery calcium in each scan and found a direct relationship between the level of calcified coronary plaque -- the fatty buildup in arteries often associated with heart disease -- and death from any cause in the subsequent years the patients were monitored.</p> <p>\"We found that those participants who had higher levels of coronary calcification, or plaque in their heart, were more likely to die over the next seven years or so,\" said Dr. Matthew Budoff, lead author of the study and a cardiologist at the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute. Among COPD patients with the highest levels of coronary artery calcium, 24.4 percent died compared with 8.4 percent of those with no calcium buildup.</p> <p>The study could help shed light on the need for people with COPD to pay closer attention to their heart while they take steps to treat their lung illness, said Dr. Irving Kron, a cardiothoracic surgeon and the interim dean at the University of Arizona's College of Medicine-Tucson.</p> <p>\"If you have chronic lung disease from smoking, you have a pretty good chance of having heart disease as well, and that's going to be more lethal to you than the lung disease,\" said Kron, who was not involved in the study.</p> <p>\"We have so much in the way of both prevention and intervention (for heart disease) these days,\" he said, stressing that recognition and acting on that awareness are key. \"As long as you deal with it, you're probably going to be OK. There are terrific therapies now to keep you going forever.\"</p> <p>An estimated 19 million routine chest CT scans are done annually, so adding a cardiovascular screening at the same time could be done \"without additional radiation, cost, or participant burden,\" according to the study.</p> <p>Heavy smokers or COPD patients are \"probably already getting a CT scan,\" Budoff said, but most radiologists don't automatically seek out signs of coronary artery calcium.</p> <p>\"We're trying to increase awareness to say, 'Look, it's already on the picture.' So while they are getting CTs of their lungs, on the scan will be a picture of their heart, so they could get two for the price of one,\" he said.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Sept. 25, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Alice Hinrichs woke up feeling miserable. She was exhausted, nauseated and her left arm hurt.</p> <p>She thought she was sick, so she called her doctor's office for an appointment. Instead, her doctor urged her to go to a hospital in case her symptoms were warnings for a heart attack. There, she was stunned to learn she had several serious health problems: atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension and an enlarged heart.</p> <p>\"I just thought I was sick,\" said Hinrichs, a 56-year-old finance manager from Gladstone, Missouri. \"Even when they told me my heart was out of rhythm, I couldn't sense any difference.\"</p> <p>Her early diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, or AFib, was crucial. Left untreated, the condition marked by an irregular heartbeat increases the risk for stroke by five times. But early detection and treatment can help prevent stroke, said Dr. Patrick T. Ellinor, a cardiologist and director for the Cardiac Arrhythmia Service at Massachusetts General Hospital.</p> <p>\"Unfortunately, some people show up with a stroke and that is when AFib is detected,\" Ellinor said.</p> <p>AFib affects more than 2.7 million Americans. It occurs when the upper chambers of the heart beat irregularly, preventing it from efficiently moving blood to the lower chambers.</p><p>September is Atrial Fibrillation Awareness Month, when health care providers try to make people aware of the condition and the importance of early detection.</p> <p>As for Hinrichs, she was greatly relieved to have her condition detected in July. She had noticed she got tired more easily in recent years.</p> <p>\"I just figured it was because I didn't work out regularly,\" she said.</p> <p>While the most common symptom for AFib is a quivering or fluttering heartbeat, some people have no symptoms. Other symptoms include fatigue, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness and sweating.</p> <p>Risk factors for AFib include high blood pressure, underlying heart disease, family history and binge drinking. Athletes and those with chronic conditions such as thyroid problems, diabetes, or asthma may also have increased risk. The risk of developing AFib increases with age -- affecting about 9 percent of people over age 65. People over 70 are more likely to not have symptoms, Ellinor said.</p> <p>Working to avoid a stroke is important to Hinrichs -- especially considering her husband survived one in 2014.</p> <p>While trying to relocate to the couch to escape his wife's snoring in July 2014, Kurt Hinrichs noticed he couldn't move his right arm and hand. He collapsed as he tried to walk, waking Alice. She called 911 and Kurt was rushed to a nearby stroke center, where he was given clot-busting medication and underwent a procedure to remove the clot.</p> <p>Within 36 hours of his stroke, Kurt had made almost a full recovery. Today, he exercises regularly and tries to maintain a healthy diet and weight to reduce his risk for another stroke. Doctors initially suspected AFib may have triggered his stroke, although an implanted heart monitor has never detected the condition.</p> <p>AFib treatment is typically medication but may include medical procedures to stop the electric signals causing an irregular heart rhythm.</p> <p>Alice Hinrichs underwent a procedure to close an appendage in her left atrium to reduce the risk of clots, in an effort to reduce her need for blood thinners. She takes medication to keep her heart from racing and reduce water retention, and she's working with specialists to treat her other conditions.</p> <p> Hinrichs made changes to her diet to focus on heart health and is trying to work more exercise into her routine.</p> <p>\"I realize now how important it is to be aware of my body and take care of myself,\" she said. \"We're taking things one day at a time and working with doctors to see what's next. This is a lifelong condition, so I know I need to be monitoring what's going on and follow up if anything changes.\"</p>",

McCoy and his colleagues reviewed records related to those breaches.</p><p>The total number of breaches have increased nearly every year, rising from 199 in 2010 to 344 in 2017.</p><p>But data hacking and information technology breaches now account for most confidentiality breaches of medical data, with 132 million records breached this way in 2017, the researchers reported.</p><p>In the past, theft of records stored on paper, laptop or electronic media had been the most common type of breach.</p><p>The risk from theft pales in comparison with hacking these days, however. More records were obtained via theft in 2017 than in any year prior, but even then only 25 million records were breached in this fashion.</p><p>The most common type of breached media in 2010 was from laptop computers, followed by paper and film records, but by 2017 network servers or emails accounted for the largest number of breaches.</p><p>Looking at overall trends, back in 2010 the most common breach involved theft of a laptop containing medical records, McCoy said.</p><p>By 2017, the most common breach involved hacking into a network server.</p><p>These results demonstrate the need for all health care entities to create strong digital security that will protect medical records, McCoy said.</p><p>\"Our patients have an expectation of confidentiality, and when a breach occurs that's a failure to meet that expectation,\" McCoy said.</p><p>McCoy couldn't say what the records are used for, since the intentions of the hackers are usually unknown to their victims.</p><p> Donaldson added that insurance companies are dedicated to protecting patient data.</p><p>\"They invest in the latest best practices to keep the bad actors out of our systems,\" Donaldson said. \"They comply with strict federal and state requirements on data security, which protect individual member information, and they keep pace as these requirements continue to evolve. When they see evidence of attempted criminal activity, they work closely with law enforcement to eliminate the risk.\"</p><p>The findings were published as a research letter in the Sept. 25 issue of the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The University of Illinois at Chicago has more about <a href=\"https://healthinformatics.uic.edu/resources/infographics/protecting-patient-information/\" target=\"_new\">medical data breaches</a>.</p>",

But researchers say a new vaccine might prevent half of full-blown illnesses in infected people who receive the shot.</p><p>\"We found that the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis was significantly lower\" for people who got the experimental vaccine, called M72/AS01, than for people who received a \"dummy\" placebo shot, reported a team led by Dr. Olivier Van Der Meeren.</p><p>He's head of clinical research at drug maker GlaxoSmithKline, which funded the study along with pharmaceutical company Aeras. The findings were published online Sept. 25 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p>While largely banished in more-affluent nations, tuberculosis (TB) is still a widespread and often fatal respiratory disease in the developing world.</p><p>In fact, there were over 10.6 million cases of TB globally in 2016, noted Helen Cox and Valerie Mizrahi, of the Wellcome Center for Infectious Diseases Research in Africa in Cape Town, South Africa. They wrote an editorial that accompanied the study.</p><p>Cox and Mizrahi also noted that TB is becoming resistant to many antibiotics, and \"less than a quarter of the estimated 600,000 patients with multidrug-resistant &hellip; tuberculosis received diagnosis and were treated.\"</p><p>So, even a middling effective vaccine would go a long way toward curbing TB's global death toll.  One vaccine -- called BCG -- does exist, but its effectiveness is limited in adults who already carry \"latent\" TB infection, Van Der Meeren's team explained.</p><p>Their new study was a phase 2 trial of the M72/AS01 vaccines carried out among nearly 3,600 adults in Kenya, South Africa and Zambia. All were latently infected with the TB bacterium and had already received the BCG vaccine.</p><p>In the trial, half of participants received two injections of the newer vaccine, while the other half got  placebo shots.</p><p>After an average 2.3 years of follow-up, the researchers reported that while 22 people in the placebo group went on to develop pulmonary TB, just 10 of those who got the vaccine did so  -- a 54 percent reduction.</p><p>The vaccine appeared safe: While two-thirds of recipients reported side effects, these were limited to injection-site reactions or transient \"flu-like\" symptoms, the team said.</p><p>According to Van Der Meeren's group, the results are \"promising\" and \"support [the vaccine's] further evaluation\" in a phase 3 trial.</p><p>One U.S. expert agreed that safe, effective TB vaccines are much needed.</p><p>\"TB is still a worldwide scourge and is easily transmitted via droplets that can be spread easily through talking, laughing and simply being in the same room as an active TB patient,\" noted Dr. Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>\"The efficacy of the vaccine was 54 percent in preventing full-blown TB,\" he said, and  \"while that may seem low, many vaccines [the influenza vaccine, for example] have a comparable success rate.\"</p><p>The bottom line, according to Horovitz, is that \"eliminating half of active cases is still significant, in light of the worldwide prevalence of TB.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on tuberculosis at the <a href=\"http://www.lung.org/lung-health-and-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/tuberculosis\" target=\"_new\">American Lung Association</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 10, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- When serious infection gives rise to septic shock, the resulting plunge in blood pressure can cripple kidney function, necessitating immediate dialysis.</p><p>But clinicians know that not all patients need it, because in the first two days after septic shock strikes, a significant number who are treated with antibiotics and fluids alone can experience a \"spontaneous\" recovery without dialysis.</p><p>The problem? Doctors can't figure out which patients will and which won't spontaneously recover. The result is an overriding pressure to place all patients with kidney failure on immediate dialysis, regardless of true need.</p><p>Now a team of French researchers has found that withholding dialysis for 48 hours -- just long enough to see if someone with septic shock will recover on his or her own -- does not increase the risk of kidney failure death.</p><p>The study's lead author, Dr. Saber Barbar, said the finding is close to being \"definitive\" and could lead to a fundamental shift in the way doctors treat such patients.</p><p>\"Our findings were not wholly unexpected,\" said Barbar, chief of the medical intensive care unit at Nimes University Hospital in Nimes, France. \"Another recent study had found similar results to ours, but in patients with kidney failure from all causes, not specifically patients with septic shock, as in our study,\" he added.</p><p>Septic shock is a dangerous reaction to serious infections, such as pneumonia or peritonitis. It results in system-wide inflammation that causes blood pressure to plummet and major organs, such as the kidneys, to fail. </p> <p>\"The criteria used to diagnose acute kidney injury are not very accurate,\" Barbar explained, making it impossible to predict accurately who needs dialysis.</p><p>So why not err on the side of caution and offer it to all patients? </p><p>Dialysis is invasive and there's a risk of infection and bleeding. \"So waiting could help to avoid these risks in certain patients who are going to spontaneously recover,\" Barbar said.</p><p>With that in mind, the study researchers focused on nearly 500 adult patients admitted to a French intensive care unit during the early stages of septic shock. All had signs of kidney failure.</p><p>Half received dialysis within 12 hours of onset of kidney failure. Unless they got worse, the other half received dialysis only after 48 hours, if they needed it.</p><p>Three months later, 58 percent of patients who had immediate dialysis had died, compared with 54 percent of those who delayed dialysis. What's more, 29 percent of patients who waited recovered without dialysis.</p> <p>Based on the findings, Barbar said: \"In the absence of emergency criteria necessitating immediate dialysis, then clinicians can safely wait for 48 hours before starting renal replacement therapy, without incurring any extra risk for the patient, as long as they continue to monitor the patient closely for any signs of complication.\" </p><p>Dr. Steven Simpson, chief medical officer of the San Diego-based Sepsis Alliance, said the findings \"make perfectly good sense.\"</p><p>Dialysis is invasive and should only be used when necessary, Simpson said. It's also risky because running a patient's blood through a machine to clear out toxins lowers blood pressure, and people with septic shock already have very low blood pressure. </p><p>\"If many of the patients in whom they delayed dialysis never needed dialysis at all, then it has to mean that if you jump right in you're giving dialysis to a whole bunch of people who don't need it,\" Simpson said. \"So if this study suggests that there isn't a really good reason to jump right in, then we shouldn't.\"</p><p>Barbar and his colleagues published their findings in the Oct. 11 issue of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more about septic shock and kidney failure at the <a href=\" https://www.sepsis.org/sepsis-and/kidney-failure/treatment/\" target=\"_new\">Sepsis Alliance</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Sept. 25, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The number of newborns suffering from syphilis has nearly tripled in recent years, U.S. health officials reported Tuesday.</p><p>Cases jumped from 362 in 2013 to 918 in 2017 -- the highest number in 20 years. Cases were seen in 37 states, mostly in the West and South.</p><p>\"We've been seeing increases in syphilis among women of reproductive age, and it's not surprising that we are seeing increases among pregnant women,\" said lead researcher Dr. Gail Bolan, director of the Division of STD Prevention at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>There's no simple answer as to why these increases are occurring, she added. Syphilis has long been associated with poverty, drug addiction, homelessness and incarceration, Bolan said.</p><p>In addition, where the health care system isn't trusted, syphilis increases, she noted.</p><p>\"It is these socioeconomic factors, where the fabric of our society is really fraying, and the women who are having babies with syphilis are really on the edge,\" Bolan said.</p><p>The increase in infants with the disease echoes the increase in syphilis cases among women of childbearing age, the agency says. And syphilis is outpacing the increase of other sexually transmitted diseases in the country, the report found. The findings were published Sept. 25 in the CDC's <i>Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance Report</i>.</p><p>Most women who give birth to babies infected with syphilis haven't received prenatal care, Bolan said. The law requires that all women be tested for syphilis at their first prenatal exam, she explained.</p><p>Bolan also said that women at high risk for syphilis should be retested in the third trimester. When the disease is caught early, a simple shot of penicillin can cure both the mother and fetus, she said.</p><p>Left untreated, an infected woman has an 80 percent chance of passing the infection to her infant, the CDC says. When a child is born with syphilis, it can be cured, but the risk of damage to organs that can lead to deafness and delayed development is already underway, Bolan said.</p><p>The CDC says that 1 in 3 women who had a baby with syphilis in 2016 was tested during pregnancy, but either got syphilis after that test or wasn't treated in time to cure the infection in the unborn baby.</p><p>This is why the CDC wants women to be tested early in pregnancy, and women at high risk for the infection to be retested during their pregnancy. This includes women living in areas where syphilis is prevalent.</p><p>In 2017, 64 babies infected with syphilis were stillborn, \"... and we believe that might be an underestimate,\" Bolan said. Infected babies can also die in the months after delivery, she added.</p><p>Sexually active women can lower their risk of getting syphilis by staying in long-term monogamous relationships with someone who's been tested for the disease and using condoms every time they have sex, the CDC advises.</p><p>One sexual health expert noted that syphilis isn't the only STD that is seeing a resurgence.</p><p>\"The jump in congenital syphilis follows a general trend of an increase in reportable STDs,\" said Fred Wyand, director of communications at the American Sexual Health Association.</p><p>Last month, the CDC released a report that found increases in rates of syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Syphilis rates were up 76 percent between 2013 and 2017, he said.</p><p>Part of the reason for the increase is that the STD prevention infrastructure continues to erode, Wyand said. \"Public health is constantly asked to do more education, treatment and surveillance, to name a few critical tasks, but with fewer resources, and we're seeing the predictable consequences of that.\"</p><p>Young people are hit especially hard and account for nearly half of all new STD cases, so naturally this affects women of childbearing age, Wyand explained.</p><p>\"It's crucial that screening guidelines are followed and that pregnant women are tested for syphilis and other STDs very early in pregnancy,\" he said. \"We need to do a better job of educating providers and patients about the necessity of screening for these infections at the first prenatal visit.\"</p><p>David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, echoed that urgency.</p><p>\"Newborns are now paying the price for our nation's growing STD crisis. That we have any cases of syphilis among newborns, let alone an increasing number, is a failure of the health care system,\" Harvey said in a statement. \"It is also a symptom of the larger STD crisis in the U.S. and a sign of a public health system in urgent need of support.</p><p>\"When a baby gets syphilis, it means the system has failed that mother repeatedly, both before and during her pregnancy,\" Harvey added. \"If STD prevention programs had anywhere near the support they need and women were getting quality preventative and prenatal care, no new mom would ever have to cope with this devastating diagnosis.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-syphilis.htm\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> for more on syphilis.</p>",

He is director of Mount Sinai Heart in New York City.</p><p>\"It's a huge high-risk population in which we now can say much more categorically, we are affecting their risk of mortality,\" Fuster said. \"This is not a trivial issue.\"</p><p>The findings are the final long-term follow-up to the landmark FREEDOM trial. (FREEDOM stands for Future Revascularization Evaluation in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus: Optimal Management of Multivessel Disease.) </p><p>Results of the follow-up were also published online Sunday in the <i>Journal of the American College of Cardiology</i>.</p><p>In 2012, the first FREEDOM results showed that diabetics with many blocked arteries had fewer heart attacks and strokes and were less likely to die if they underwent bypass surgery instead of getting a stent.</p><p>But the results for death risk alone were \"borderline\" by the time of the average 3.8-year follow-up, Fuster said. So researchers decided to continue tracking patients and see if a more clear benefit would emerge.</p><p>The initial trial involved 1,900 patients who randomly underwent either stenting or bypass surgery between 2005 and 2010.</p><p>During an additional five years of follow-up, about 24 percent of people who received stents died, compared with 18 percent of those who had bypass surgery.</p><p>Overall, people treated with bypass surgery had 36 percent better odds of survival.</p><p>\"The results are quite significant in terms of mortality,\" Fuster said. \"They're not borderline anymore.\"</p><p>Both men and women and all races saw a survival benefit from bypass surgery, but the greatest benefit was in patients younger than 65, the findings showed.</p><p>Current guidelines already call for bypass surgery in these patients, said Dr. Michael Valentine, president of the American College of Cardiology.</p><p>\"I think what this does is it solidifies our current recommendations and guidelines,\" said Valentine, a senior cardiologist at the Stroobants Cardiovascular Center of Centra Health in Lynchburg, Va. </p><p>Stents can clog over time, and don't address widespread hardening of the arteries in these patients, Valentine and Fuster said.</p><p>\"The vessels stay open longer with an arterial bypass,\" Valentine said.</p><p>Fuster agreed. \"When you use bypass, you bypass everything. It is a safe mechanism. It is a pipe that overcomes everything,\" he said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institutes of Health has more about  <a href=\" https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/coronary-artery-bypass-grafting\" target=\"_new\">coronary bypass surgery</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Sept. 25, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Heather Kinion never spent much time thinking about her weight. But when she got pregnant, that changed. </p><p>\"My sister had a baby a few years before me and had gained a bunch of weight, and she still hadn't lost it when I got pregnant,\" Kinion said. So the Chicago-area mom-to-be was happy to sign up for a nutritional counseling program her doctor's office was offering as part of a study. </p><p>The study program from Northwestern University is dubbed Momfit. It encourages expectant mothers to eat healthy foods, gain the recommended amount of weight, exercise regularly, and sleep seven to nine hours a night. </p><p>Women received in-person nutritional counseling. They also had help from technology: Telephone, text message prompts and e-mail reminders kept pregnancy goals on their minds. The women also tracked what they ate in a smartphone app. </p><p>The goal was not to lose weight, but to gain weight within recommended guidelines. Overall, the Momfit participants gained about 4 fewer pounds throughout pregnancy than those given standard care.</p><p>As for Kinion, she only gained 20 pounds throughout her pregnancy. \"I was really concerned that I would gain a bunch of weight. It was winter, and I like comfort foods, but because I was reporting what I ate, I made sure to eat three servings of vegetables and two fruits, along with whole grains and a decent amount of dairy.\"</p><p>She got better at portion control, too, she said. And the program \"left me room to be indulgent, so I didn't feel deprived. I was able to eat a good balance of foods,\" she added. </p><p>After her daughter's birth, Kinion chose to breastfeed. She said the pregnancy weight came off quickly. </p><p>Study author Linda Van Horn said the study aimed to see if women could safely avoid excess weight gain during pregnancy. </p><p>\"The majority of pregnant women are overweight or obese at the time of conception. It's a major public health concern,\" said Van Horn, a professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.</p><p>The U.S Institute of Medicine recommends that normal-weight women gain 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy, but just 15 to 25 pounds if they're overweight at the start of pregnancy. Women who are obese should only gain 11 to 20 pounds while expecting, the IOM says. </p><p>Gaining too much weight during pregnancy can have consequences for both mom and baby. </p><p>\"Weight gain is definitely a big concern,\" said Dr. Navid Mootabar, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y.</p><p>\"Proper attention to appropriate amount of weight gain results in better pregnancy outcomes. It leads to a decreased risk of high blood pressure and gestational diabetes. Appropriate weight gain also decreases the risk of a cesarean section birth,\" Mootabar said. </p><p>Van Horn added that appropriate weight gain can help new mothers avoid obesity after pregnancy. It can also help children avoid overweight and obesity. </p><p>\"The old saying is, 'You are what you eat.' Now it may be, 'You are what your mother ate,' \" she said. </p><p>The study included nearly 300 pregnant women between 18 and 45 years old. All fell into the overweight or obese range. About 62 percent were white. </p><p>The nutritionists gave half the women advice based on a modified version of the DASH (Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension) diet that focuses on fruits and vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins. It limits saturated fats and discourages sugar-sweetened beverages and snack foods. The \"MAMA-DASH\" diet added more dairy and limited fish that might contain mercury, according to the study. </p><p>Walking was important, too, with Momfit participants asked to walk at least 30 minutes or take 10,000 steps a day.</p><p>Van Horn acknowledged that Momfit isn't a magic bullet. </p><p>\"Moms who were obese were recommended to gain between 10 and 15 pounds, and very few were in that range. But they did gain less than the usual care group. It's a challenge to have moms make those changes in daily dietary calories,\" she said. </p><p>The study also found a higher rate of C-sections in moms who participated in the program. The researchers aren't sure why that is, however. </p><p>One of the bright spots in the study is that moms are using the nutritional lessons with their children. </p><p>\"I definitely make better food choices now, and my daughter Julia eats a lot better than she might have if I hadn't been in the study. She eats lots of vegetables,\" Kinion said. </p><p>The study was published Sept. 24 in the <i>American Journal of Preventive Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has more on <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Nutrition-During-Pregnancy\" target=\"_new\">nutrition during pregnancy</a>.</p>",

If you call your doctor's office with an urgent need, a PA might be the professional who can see you right away.</p><p>The American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA) defines a PA as a medical professional who works as part of a team with a doctor. Physician assistants have three years of generalized training with exposure to many areas of medicine. They are graduates of accredited educational programs that include classroom instruction and clinical rotations, and they're nationally certified and state-licensed to practice medicine with the supervision of a physician.</p><p>The AAPA is pushing to change the requirement that a PA have a set agreement with a doctor in order to practice, which could expand the availability of health-care services in the years to come.</p><p>Besides primary care offices, some PAs work alongside surgeons and have roles in both outpatient and inpatient facilities. You also may find a PA in specialty practices, such as in a cardiologist's office.</p><p>The extent to which a PA is involved with patients is often determined by the practice's supervising doctor. The PA's duties can include doing physical exams, making diagnoses, prescribing treatment, ordering tests and interpreting results. Some PAs go on rounds in hospitals or conduct research.</p><p>Many PAs place an emphasis on preventive care and stress the importance of a healthy lifestyle. That means a PA can be your partner in living well and living longer.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Physician Assistants offers a wealth of information on <a href=\"https://www.aapa.org/what-is-a-pa/\" target=\"_new\">the role of the physician assistant</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 9, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Eating healthier requires a mindset change. But it also helps to make changes in your home environment to encourage a new and better way of approaching food -- starting in the kitchen.</p><p>First, do a deep dive into your fridge. You want to rearrange shelves and drawers to make healthier foods easier to find. This is also a great time to purge both outdated items and foods that just aren't good for you.</p><p>Use drawers for high-calorie foods that you must keep but don't need to see. Then move veggies and fruits to eye level so that every time you open the fridge to look for something to eat, that's what you'll see first. Hint: Prep your veggies and fruits before refrigerating them so you won't first have to clean and cut them when you want a snack.</p><p>Nuts and seeds are loaded with taste and nutrients, but they're also high in calories. Make your own mixes, then measure out 1-ounce servings and package them in baggies or wax paper bundles. Store in the fridge to keep them fresher.</p><p>Always have a pitcher of D.I.Y. flavored water in the fridge to answer the urge for a soda. Experiment with citrus, watermelon or cucumber slices, crushed berries, mint or other herbs to see what tastes best to you.</p><p>Stock your pantry with a selection of oils and a variety of flavored vinegars to make your own salad dressings and marinades. Tip: Delicate oils, like those made from nuts, will last longer in the fridge. Other oils need a cool, dark cabinet -- light is the enemy so don't leave them out on your countertop.</p><p>Fill all your salt shakers with no-salt spice blends instead. These add variety to simple tomato sauces and whole grain pastas as well as steamed veggies.</p><p>It should only take an hour or so to do this kitchen \"remodel,\" but the results can translate to a lifetime of better health.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Cleveland Clinic has <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/10-ways-to-stock-your-fridge-for-weight-loss/\" target=\"_new\">10 tips</a> for stocking your fridge for weight loss.</p>",

This study adds to a body of literature that shows it's very reasonable to have an NP or PA as a primary care provider,\" said study author George Jackson, a research health scientist at the Durham VA Health Care System in North Carolina.</p><p>That's good news since about one-third of those who have a regular primary care provider see a PA or NP at least once a year. Plus, almost half of patients with diabetes see a PA or NP for at least part of their care, according to background information in the study. </p><p>\"PAs, NPs and physicians have different types of training, different times in training and sometimes a different focus in training. But all three commonly serve as primary care providers,\" Jackson explained. All three can prescribe medication and order tests, though there could be limits to what PAs and NPs can prescribe, depending on the state.</p><p>The new research included nearly 370,000 patients. They received care at one of 568 primary care practices in the U.S. Veterans Administration health system. All were receiving medication to treat their diabetes. </p><p>About 75 percent of the patients were treated by physicians. Eighteen percent were treated by nurse practitioners and 7 percent received care from physician assistants, the study authors said. </p><p>The researchers looked at blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. There were no significant differences in these measures based on whether a doctor, NP or PA treated patients. </p><p>The findings were published Nov. 19 in the <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p>Dr. Anne Peters, from the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, wrote in an accompanying editorial, \"The time has come to embrace many different approaches to providing primary care, particularly for persons with a chronic disease, such as diabetes.\"</p><p>She concluded, \"Nurse practitioners and PAs are competent PCPs [primary care providers] in their own right and should be fully accepted as such.\" </p><p>Dr. Jonathan Sobel, president and chair of the Board of Directors of the American Academy of PAs, said he wasn't at all surprised by the findings. \"People should feel confident in PAs. More and more studies are demonstrating the high quality care provided by PAs,\" he said.</p><p>Sobel explained that physician assistants receive thousands of hours of training. And, he said that diabetes is a perfect example of a condition that PAs can manage well. </p><p>\"PAs are a very important part of the solution to the physician shortage, especially in rural areas,\" Sobel said. </p><p>He noted that insurance -- especially Medicare -- may dictate what types of services these providers can offer. For example, he said, Medicare won't allow PAs to prescribe special shoes for people with diabetes. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about physician assistants and nurse practitioners from the <a href=\"https://nursejournal.org/nurse-practitioner/np-vs-physician-assistants/\" target=\"_new\">Nurse Journal</a>.</p>",

But if you don't know how they work you could be inviting an accident, new research suggests.</p><p>These advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) -- including blind-spot monitoring, forward-collision warning and lane-keeping assist  -- can, when used properly, make your driving safer. But many drivers are unaware of the limitations of these advances, the authors of the report said.</p><p>\"When properly utilized, advanced driver assistance system technologies have the potential to prevent 40 percent of all vehicle crashes and nearly 30 percent of traffic deaths,\" said Dr. David Yang, executive director of the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.</p><p>But the new findings, published Sept. 26 by the foundation, show that a lot of work needs to be done in educating drivers about the limitations of these devices and their proper use, he added.</p><p>For example, nearly eight out  of 10 drivers with blind-spot monitoring systems didn't know the limitations of this feature. These systems only work when a car is traveling in a driver's blind spot, and many systems do not detect vehicles traveling at high speeds.</p><p>Not understanding driver assistance systems may lead to misuse or over-reliance and could result in a deadly crash, the researchers said.</p><p>In the United States in 2016, more than 37,400 people were killed in traffic crashes -- a 5 percent increase from 2015, according to a AAA news release.</p><p>For the new study, researchers from the University of Iowa surveyed drivers who purchased a 2016 or 2017 car with ADAS technologies. </p><p>The investigators evaluated drivers' opinions, awareness and understanding of these safety features, and found that most did not know or understand the limitations of these systems.</p><p>Most drivers (80 percent) did not know the limitations of blind-spot detectors.

Among those who were, nearly 90 percent completed the training.</p><p>AAA advises all new car owners to read up on the car's safety devices and actually see how they work.

And a heaviness in the left side of her chest.</p> <p>Worse yet, those feelings were awfully familiar.</p> <p>Seven years after surviving a \"widow maker\" heart attack, she knew she was having another. And that there was no time to waste.</p> <p>Huss got to the hospital in time for doctors to discover that the stents that had propped open crucial arteries in her heart had become clogged again. She underwent an emergency procedure to re-open them, allowing the blood to begin flowing again.</p> <p>But for how long? Her doctor was concerned enough to mention she may need a new heart.</p> <p>That was nearly two years ago. Despite the challenges, she's determined to embrace life and so, in a few days, she'll walk down the aisle to be married.</p> <p>Huss' story begins in 2009. At 38, she was in the best shape of her life.</p> <p>In fact, she'd just gotten home from a 5-mile walk when she started feeling short of breath and tightness in her chest.</p> <p>Many people might have chalked these symptoms up to overexertion. As the nurse manager of an emergency department, however, she knew better.</p> <p>Doctors discovered that her left anterior descending coronary artery -- the one that supplies most of the blood to the heart -- was 100 percent blocked. And her right coronary artery was 60 percent blocked. Three stents later, blood flow to her heart had been restored. She also received a defibrillator to help keep her heart in rhythm.</p> <p>Huss was diagnosed with heart failure, which means her heart wasn't pumping blood as efficiently as it should. She managed this by returning to her healthy lifestyle.</p> <p>Then came November 2016 and the sensations she recognized right away, all of which led to her doctor -- Dr. Prashanth Katrapati, an interventional cardiologist with Providence Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas -- to mention the possibility of a heart transplant.</p> <p>\"She's lost heart muscle,\" he said. \"People usually don't live 30 years with a heart like hers. I wanted to get her prepared for the possibility.\"</p> <p>Although she presented a brave face after the first heart attack, her resolve weakened after the second.</p> <p>While she and Ronnie Monroe had known each other for years, they'd only recently become a couple and were getting serious. She steeled herself and asked if he really wanted to stay with someone with such dire health problems.</p> <p>He replied that he most certainly did.</p> <p>\"I never saw someone who had a heart issue or any type of physical limitation,\" said Monroe, a systems analyst with the U.S. Department of Defense, who often accompanies Huss to her doctor appointments. \"I saw someone who worked really hard and embraced both having fun and a heart condition.\"</p> <p>While Katrapati continues to regularly monitor her heart, all Huss' attention these days is on their October wedding, scheduled to take place in Overland Park, Kansas.</p> <p>\"I've had some close calls, but Ronnie and I know this is our chance to throw a big party to celebrate our love,\" she said. \"Because I know that life is precious.\"</p> <p>She also knows that too many women think heart attacks only happen to men, especially older men. And she knows that heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women -- more than all forms of cancer combined. She also knows the warning signs can be different for women.</p> <p>She has used that knowledge to her advantage. Twice. Now she shares her story in the hopes it will inspire others, too.</p>",

While protecting yourself, you are also protecting those around you.\"</p><p>The estimated 80,000 who died from flu and its complications last winter amounted to the most seasonal deaths since the CDC started calculating flu season death tolls in 1976, CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund told <i>CNN</i>.</p><p>The worst recent flu season on record had been 2012-2013, during which 56,000 people died. H3N2 flu predominated that season as well.</p><p>A record 180 children died from the flu during the 2017-2018 season, exceeding the 171 deaths that occurred during the 2012-2013 season, the CDC reported.</p><p>\"A majority of them were unvaccinated,\" Adams said. During most flu seasons, eight out of 10 reported pediatric deaths occur in children not fully vaccinated against flu.</p><p>In addition, a record-breaking 900,000 hospitalizations were caused by the flu during the last season, prompting news coverage of hospitals overflowing with sick people.</p><p>The 2017-2018 season is the first ever to be classified as high severity across all age groups, the CDC added.</p><p>It didn't help that vaccination rates dipped even as the United States faced this deadly wave of flu, infection experts said.</p><p>Overall vaccinations declined by 1.1 percent, to 57.9 percent from 59 percent the previous season.</p><p>More troubling were declines in specific groups that either are vulnerable to the flu or in a position to further spread the virus.</p><p>Fewer children aged 6 months to 4 years old received a flu shot last season, Adams said.</p><p>\"These kids are often particularly vulnerable to serious complications if they get sick, even if they were previously healthy,\" Adams said.</p><p>Young children also are prime vectors for spreading the flu throughout their families, including grandparents whose immune systems aren't as capable of battling the virus, explained Dr. Wendy Sue Swanson. She is chief of digital innovation at Seattle Children's Hospital and a mother of two little boys.</p><p>\"Kids have a lot of snot and they have a lot of drool, and they go to school,\" Swanson said. \"And when they go to school, they share all of those secretions. Now, they're lovely and we love them, but they are a lot of the reason flu moves around communities.\"</p><p>There also was a decline in vaccination rates among pregnant women during the last flu season, the CDC said.</p><p>The immune systems of pregnant women are compromised, making them more vulnerable to the flu, explained Dr. Laura Elizabeth Riley, director of obstetrics and gynecology infectious disease at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.</p><p>\"When pregnant women get really high fever for extended periods of time, we know that fever actually causes birth defects,\" Riley said. \"That's something that is preventable.\"</p><p>And Adams added that pregnant women who get a flu shot also help protect their unborn babies. Children younger than 6 months can't receive a flu shot, so their only guard against the flu is whatever antibodies have passed to them from their mothers.</p><p> Swanson pointed out that \"a child who's born to a mom who's immunized has a 72 percent reduction in having hospitalization from flu in those first months of life.\"</p><p>A number of vaccine types are available, including a nasal spray, public health officials said Thursday.</p><p>Adams led by example at Thursday's news briefing, receiving his flu vaccination along with former Cleveland Browns lineman Joe Thomas and Dr. Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about the <a href=\" https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season-2017-2018.htm \" target=\"_new\">2017-2018 flu season</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 28, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Does being the youngest in the class up your child's odds of being erroneously diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?</p><p>It might. New research suggests these kids appear to be about 30 percent more likely to receive a <i>diagnosis</i> of ADHD. However, it probably doesn't change a child's actual risk of developing ADHD. </p><p>So if your child was an August baby and your school district has a Sept. 1 birth date cutoff for school admissions, your child will be one of the youngest in class. And, particularly in the early grades, those age gaps can make a big difference in behavior, researchers said. </p><p>\"Physicians should take into account a child's age relative to their peers. Behavior that is normal for a child's age may appear anomalous when compared to older peers,\" explained study author Timothy Layton, an assistant professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School. </p><p>The consequences from not factoring in age might be overdiagnosis and overtreatment of the disorder, according to Layton. He noted that kids born in August (in areas with a September birthday cutoff) were also more likely to be given medication for ADHD symptoms. </p><p>ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that's common in children, but it may not always last into adulthood, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Kids with ADHD may have trouble controlling their behavior, may act impulsively and may be overly active, the CDC says. </p><p>ADHD rates have been rising sharply among America's youth. Over the past two decades, the rate of ADHD jumped from 6 percent to 10 percent, according to a recent study from the University of Iowa.</p><p>In children between ages 2 and 5, the rate of ADHD diagnosis went up by 50 percent between 2007 and 2012, according to background information from the study. In 2016, more than 5 percent of U.S. children were being treated with medication for ADHD. </p><p>There's no single test that can diagnose ADHD, the CDC says. Instead, doctors must rely on a medical exam, along with information from parents, teachers and, sometimes, the child. Doctors have to rule out other disorders that can cause symptoms similar to ADHD. </p><p>To see how a child's birth date might affect the risk of being diagnosed with ADHD, the researchers reviewed data from a large insurance database with information on more than 400,000 youngsters from 50 states. The kids were born between 2007 and 2009, and followed through 2015. </p><p>In states that had a Sept. 1 cutoff date for starting kindergarten, the researchers found that 85 out of 10,000 August-born youngsters were diagnosed with ADHD. For those born in September, the ADHD rate was 64 per 10,000 kids. </p><p>When the researchers looked at treatment for ADHD, they found that 53 out of 10,000 children born in August were getting ADHD medication, compared to 40 out of 10,000 kids born in September. </p><p>Layton said these findings would likely hold true in districts that had other cutoff dates for starting school. For example, in a school with a Dec. 1 birthday cutoff for school entry, kids born in November would probably be more likely to receive an ADHD diagnosis than kids born in December. </p><p>Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y., said, \"This nicely designed study has confirmed what several other investigators have likewise demonstrated -- that the youngest children within a grade are more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than are the oldest children in that same grade.\" </p><p>Adesman, who was not part of the study, said that if the researchers looked at kids closer in age in the same grade, say, just a few months apart, the differences would likely be smaller. </p><p>He said this study suggests that parents of kids who are young for their grade who have ADHD symptoms may want to consider having their child repeat a grade. This might give a child time to mature, so he or she will behave more appropriately in school. </p><p>The findings were published Nov. 28 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics' Healthy Children website has more on <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/adhd/Pages/Diagnosing-ADHD-in-Children-Guidelines-Information-for-Parents.aspx\" target=\"_new\">diagnosing ADHD</a>.</p>",

That's what we found, even though what kids are getting really hasn't changed.\"</p><p>Since 2013, the four largest fast food restaurant chains -- McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's and Subway -- have introduced policies to offer healthier drinks and sides with their kids' meals, Harris said.</p><p>To see whether these policies have made a difference, the Rudd Center conducted an online survey with approximately 800 parents regarding lunch or dinner purchases at one of the big four chains.</p><p>Published Sept. 27, the Rudd survey found that 74 percent of kids still receive unhealthy drinks or side items with their kids' meals when they eat fast food:</p><ul><li>Only 6 out of 10 parents who purchased a kids' meal received a healthier drink such as low-fat milk or fruit juice, indicating no change between 2010 and 2016.</li><li>Two-thirds of parents chose a healthier drink for a preschool-age child (2-5), on average, but only half chose a healthier drink for an older child (6-11).</li><li>Half of parents received a healthier side with a kids' meal in 2016, such as yogurt or apple slices. However, 6 out of 10 received an unhealthy side like french fries or chips, since some restaurants now offer two sides with kids' meals.</li></ul><p>The healthy-option policies have made a difference in one critical way, however.</p><p>Nearly all of the parents said they plan to purchase fast food for their child more often because of restaurants' healthier kids' meal policies, researchers found.</p><p>\"When you ask parents about that, they think it's great that kids' meals are healthier now,\" Harris said. \"But there really hasn't been any change.\"</p><p>About one-third of parents didn't even bother with a kids' meal for their children. They purchased regular menu items, which include adult-sized portions and tend to be less nutritious than kids' meal items.</p><p>The Rudd Center argues that policymakers should follow the lead of communities in California, Colorado, Kentucky and Maryland, where laws or regulations have been adopted to require that all restaurants automatically provide healthy drinks and sides with kids' meals.</p><p>Restaurants can help by promoting healthier choices and discontinuing the practice of offering unhealthy sides alongside healthier sides, the Rudd Center added.</p><p>But parents also need to step up, said registered dietitian nutritionist Malina Linkas Malkani, a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.</p><p>\"Until there is more widely enacted legislation that requires the restaurants to automatically offer these healthy choices, the responsibility falls pretty squarely on parents and caregivers to make the healthier choices and to teach their children how to make those choices for themselves,\" Malkani said.</p><p>Parents should teach kids to avoid foods heavy in added sugars, sodium and saturated fat, Malkani said. They also should promote foods rich in protein, calcium, vitamin D, iron, healthy fats and vitamin C.</p><p>Malkani said it was \"disheartening to hear the high percentage of children who received the less healthy beverages and sides, but I did think it was good news that there are healthier beverages and sides available.</p><p>\"I have to give so much credit to the chains that are offering the healthier choices automatically. I hope this is a trend that takes off,\" she said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians has more about <a href=\"https://familydoctor.org/making-healthy-choices-fast-food-restaurants/\" target=\"_new\">healthy fast food choices</a>.</p>",

So said the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention late Tuesday in an interview with the <i>Associated Press</i>.</p><p>As autumn brings another flu season, CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield told the <i>AP</i> that \"I'd like to see more people get vaccinated.\"  </p><p>The agency recommends that everyone over the age of 6 months get the annual flu shot.</p><p>Last year's flu season made headlines for its scope and severity, but the new number still surprised experts.</p><p>\"That's huge,\" Dr, William Schaffer, a vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, told the <i>AP</i>. He said that 80,000 deaths is more than double the number expected in a typical \"bad\" flu season. In recent years, the annual flu death toll has ranged from 12,000 to 56,000 deaths, the CDC said.</p><p>The 2017-2018 flu season was made worse by two factors:  strains that hit the very young and elderly especially hard, and a poor matchup between those strains and those in the flu vaccine.</p><p>Still, even the relatively weak flu shot probably saved many lives, CDC experts say, so everyone should avail themselves of the shot again this season.</p><p>The flu typically kills by triggering other deadly conditions such as pneumonia, stroke and heart attack. The most deadly flu season on record remains that of thew 1918 pandemic, when upwards of 500,000 Americans are thought to have died.</p><p>As for the coming season, the CDC says that, so far, at least the circulating strain seems to be a milder one, and there are preliminary signs that the vaccine match is good.</p><p>\"We don't know what's going to happen, but we're seeing more encouraging signs than we were early last year,\" CDC flu expert Dr. Daniel Jernigan told the <i>AP</i>.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Opioid Bill Gets Bipartisan Support</b></span></p><p>In a rare bipartisan move, both the House and Senate have reached a compromise on legislation to address the opioid epidemic.</p><p>Containing a mix of law enforcement and public health measures, including one that aims to block deadly fentanyl from being imported through the mail and one that will allow more nurses to prescribe medication for opioid addiction, the bill is 653 pages long, the <i>New York Times</i> reported.</p><p>Yet another part of the legislation could make it easier for Medicaid recipients to get inpatient care for substance abuse over the next five years, the newspaper said.</p><p>\"While there is more work to be done, this bipartisan legislation takes an important step forward and will save lives,\" a group of Republican and Democratic committee leaders said in a statement Tuesday.</p><p>But addiction experts say that while many of the measures will help incrementally, the investment still falls short of what is needed to stem the tide of opioid abuse. Nearly 50,000 Americans died in opioid-related deaths in 2017, the <i>Times</i> reported.</p><p>Both chambers still need to vote on the compromise bill.

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Oct. 5, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- A routine visit to the doctor's office typically results in a single blood pressure measurement.</p> <p>But for people on the verge of being diagnosed with high blood pressure, or hypertension, visits usually involve several additional checks at the office, along with a recommendation of having more taken at home. But how many?</p> <p>At least three days' worth, according to a new study published Oct. 5 in the <i>Journal of the American Heart Association</i>.</p> <p>\"Our paper is really to help practicing clinicians figure out what's enough when it comes to number of measurements for them to feel confident that they have a good representation of patients' blood pressure outside the clinic,\" said study author Dr. Natalie Bello, an assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City.</p> <p>Home blood pressure monitoring is a common approach after a patient has been screened at a clinic, but before the person receives an official hypertension diagnosis. That's because measurements taken in a medical office can sometimes be misleadingly high. For some patients, nerves or stress related to being at the doctor's office can be enough to spike blood pressure. In others, conversely, their number will look normal at the clinic, but high at home because of environmental factors.</p> <p>The study looked at 316 adults who were not on medication for blood pressure. Participants did not have a history of cardiovascular disease and were otherwise healthy. Their blood pressure was taken multiple times during two clinical visits, and they were given a blood pressure monitoring device that electronically stores information from each use. They also were given detailed instructions on how to obtain the most accurate measurement possible.</p> <p>Over two weeks, participants were asked to take measurements twice in the morning and twice again at night.</p> <p>\"Using the average of morning and evening readings, a minimum of three days are needed to reliably estimate out-of-office blood pressure and confirm a diagnosis of hypertension,\" the researchers wrote in their report.</p> <p>Using blood pressure guidelines released last November, which set new hypertension thresholds, participants who consistently took two readings in the morning and two readings in the evening would only need two days of home measurements. If they only took one in the morning and one in the evening, the study showed three days was the ideal time frame to help confirm a diagnosis of high blood pressure.</p> <p>The guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, which defined hypertension as a measurement of 130/80 rather than the previous 140/90, emphasized having patients monitor their own blood pressure as part of \"hypertension diagnosis, treatment and management.\"</p> <p>Dr. Paul Whelton, who chaired the guideline writing committee, commended the study's design and analysis but urged caution about some of its limitations. People who are candidates for home blood pressure monitoring because they may have hypertension are different than the ones seen in the study, he said.</p> <p>The average age of participants was 42, and people with chronic kidney disease, overt cardiovascular problems and other health conditions were excluded, he said. In addition, the study included only a small number of people with diabetes.</p> <p>\"They were looking at a younger cohort that's healthier [but] if you walk into any clinic where you see patients with high blood pressure, they're going to be older and sicker\" and have a combination of chronic conditions, said Whelton, an epidemiology professor at Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in New Orleans.</p> <p>Blood pressure can easily fluctuate depending on when and how it is measured, he added.</p> <p>\"We take terrible measurements of blood pressure. But whether it's in the office or at home, it can be done well. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to do a good blood pressure,\" Whelton said.</p> <p>Patients need a period of rest before the measurement and a proper cuff size, he said. They shouldn't talk and should sit in a chair with an upright back with feet on the floor. \"Those are the key issues to avoiding predictable errors.\"</p> <p>Bello said it's also important that patients use equipment that has been validated for clinical accuracy.</p> <p>\"Not everything that's available in the pharmacy has necessarily been validated,\" she said, urging people already using home-based devices to bring them in to their doctor's office for review at least once.</p>",

But new research suggests that women who've undergone weight-loss surgery might have a safer delivery.</p><p>\"We know that obesity and overweight are dangerous in connection with childbirth,\" said study author Dr. Olof Stephansson, of Karolinska Institute in Solna, Sweden.</p><p>Weight-loss [bariatric] surgery \"is by far your best option if you want a lasting weight reduction over time,\" he said in an institute news release. </p><p>The study of almost 6,000 women found weight-loss surgery was tied to fewer cesarean sections, infections, tears, hemorrhages or post-term deliveries.</p><p>Obesity in pregnancy is a growing problem. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the percentage of American women who were obese at the start of their pregnancy jumped 8 percent between 2011 and 2015. And overweight rates at conception increased 2 percent during that same period.</p><p>For the new study, researchers compared the deliveries of more than 1,400 women who had undergone weight-loss surgery and lost a significant amount of weight with the deliveries of almost 4,500 women who did not have this type of surgery. </p><p>\"The effects were quite salient, and all of those we studied were to the benefit of the women who'd had surgery,\" Stephansson said. \"There are a lower proportion of C-sections, fewer induced deliveries, a lower proportion of post-term deliveries, less frequent epidurals and fewer cases of uterine inertia, infection, perineal tears and hemorrhaging,\" he said.</p><p>The findings of this observational study don't prove cause and effect, but the researchers suggested that weight loss before pregnancy helped ensure a safer childbirth. But they noted that previous studies have shown that women who've had weight-loss surgery are at slightly higher risk for premature delivery or having smaller babies.</p><p>\"It's therefore not as simple as just advising every woman who's overweight to have bariatric surgery,\" Stephansson said. \"But going by the results of this study, it has positive effects for mothers. More studies are needed in which we weigh up outcomes so that we can give a more general recommendation.\"</p><p>The study was published recently in <i>PLOS Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases provides more on <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/bariatric-surgery/types\" target=\"_new\"> weight-loss surgery</a>.</p>",

People were asked about 94 topics. The survey  found nearly 74 percent of respondents saying they were \"afraid\" or \"very afraid\" about corrupt government officials.</p><p>The other top fears were: pollution of oceans, rivers and lakes (61.6 percent); pollution of drinking water (60.7 percent); not having enough money for the future (57 percent); people they love becoming seriously ill (56.5 percent); people they love dying (56.4 percent); air pollution (55 percent); extinction of plant and animal species (54 percent); global warming and climate change (53.2 percent): and high medical bills (53 percent).</p><p>This year, each of the top 10 fears were held by more than half of those surveyed, compared with only five of the top 10 fears in 2017, according to the researchers behind the survey.</p><p>The researchers pointed to two notable trends.</p><p>Since 2016, there has been a 13 percent increase in fear of corrupt government officials. There were no significant differences by political affiliation.</p><p>And no environmental concern made the top 10 list in 2016, compared with five this year, the researchers noted.</p><p>The findings \"illustrate a continued shift in the primary concerns of American citizens,\" Christopher Bader, a professor of sociology, said in a university news release.</p><p>\"It is worth noting that &hellip; all top 10 fears continue to reflect topics often discussed in the media,\" he added.</p><p>The survey challenges President Donald Trump's concerns about immigration. Only 18 percent of respondents said they agreed or strongly agreed that immigrants are more likely to commit crime than U.S. citizens, Bader said.</p><p>The survey also assessed disaster preparedness and people's willingness to evacuate. Even though 21 percent of the respondents said they or their family members have had to suddenly leave their homes due to disaster, a higher percentage cited reasons why they would not or could not evacuate.</p><p>These include: wanting to protect their home from looting (43 percent); unwillingness to leave pets behind (34 percent); survived past storms without evacuating (34 percent); the cost of food, gas and lodging (32 percent); having a disability or someone in the home with a disability (14 percent); and lack of transportation (14 percent).</p><p>The survey also asked respondents about seven paranormal beliefs, including ghosts, aliens, psychic powers and hauntings.</p><p>\"More than [75 percent] of Americans believe in at least one paranormal phenomenon compared to 64 percent in previous years,\" Bader said.</p><p>The most common paranormal belief is that places can be haunted by spirits (58 percent), followed by the belief that ancient, advanced civilizations -- such as Atlantis -- once existed (57 percent). More than 41 percent of respondents believe that aliens visited Earth in ancient times and more than one-third believe aliens are still making visits.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Anxiety and Depression Association of America offers <a href=\"https://adaa.org/tips-manage-anxiety-and-stress\" target=\"_new\">tips to manage anxiety and stress</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 8, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Treatments for \"tennis elbow\" are generally ineffective, researchers say, but don't despair: The painful condition will usually clear up on its own.</p> <p>Each year, approximately 200,000 Americans are diagnosed with tennis elbow -- inflammation caused by overuse of the tendons in the forearm. The condition can affect anyone who uses their hands and wrists for hours each day, such as carpenters, food workers, manufacturers and office workers.</p><p>Patients can choose from a host of treatments, including steroid injections, physical therapy, acupuncture, anti-inflammatories, Botox injections, ultrasound and laser therapy. But significant pain relief from these options is unlikely, a new study found.</p><p>\"We evaluated almost all of the nonsurgical treatments available for tennis elbow and showed that they provide only minimal effect over placebo,\" said study author Dr. Amin Mohamadi, a research fellow at Harvard Medical School.</p><p>For example, corticosteroids were more effective than a placebo within the first four weeks, but they lost their advantage after that, he said. </p><p>So what can someone with a bum elbow do?</p><p>Doctors can opt for a pain reliever to manage symptoms on a patient-to-patient basis, Mohamadi said. His team suggested this be limited to four weeks. </p><p>\"Our results imply that for most patients, tennis elbow is a self-limiting condition,\" he said. \"Based on these findings, the overall recommendation is wait and see.\"</p><p>Dr. Steven Beldner is co-director of the New York Hand and Wrist Center at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>Beldner, who was not involved with the study, agreed that for most patients, tennis elbow gets better by itself.</p><p>\"The question is, do people really want to suffer with this condition for six or seven months?\" he said. The pain can be so great that some people may have to avoid using their arm, he noted. </p><p>And not every case of tennis elbow will improve unaided, Beldner added.</p><p>\"Five percent of people who have this, no matter what treatment they undergo, will not get better and will eventually need surgery,\" Beldner said.</p><p>For the study, Mohamadi's team reviewed 36 previously published studies that included more than 2,700 patients. The papers evaluated 11 nonsurgical treatments for tennis elbow.</p><p>The researchers looked at the effects of treatment on pain and grip strength at four weeks after diagnosis, between five and 26 weeks after diagnosis and after more than 26 weeks.</p><p>None of the treatments showed any significant benefit within four weeks of diagnosis, according to the study.</p><p>After 26 weeks, the researchers found that 99 percent of patients who received placebos such as saline injections or sugar pills had little to no pain. </p><p>At five to 26 weeks, those who had laser therapy or Botox injections said they had a small but statistically significant reduction in pain, compared with those who had other treatments. </p><p>After 26 weeks, only those treated with shock wave therapy reported any long-term benefit, compared with other treatments. Patients who had steroid injections complained of worse pain than those given placebo injections, the researchers noted. </p><p>Regarding grip strength, only laser therapy outperformed placebos, the researchers said.</p><p>The study also found that reported side effects were more prevalent among those given a real treatment than those given sham treatment.</p><p>But for manual laborers who can't \"wait and see,\" earlier treatment might help, the researchers said. However, that needs to be proved in randomized trials, they added.</p><p>The report was published Nov. 1 in the <i>American Journal of Sports Medicine</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons offers more on <a href=\"https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/tennis-elbow-lateral-epicondylitis/\" target=\"_new\">tennis elbow</a>.</p>",

They ranged in age from 40 to 73 at the beginning of the study and had no prior history of stroke or heart attack.</p><p>The researchers used 90 gene variants known to be linked to stroke to calculate a \"genetic risk score\" for each study participant.</p><p>Genes did matter, of course. Overall, the stroke rate rose by 35 percent for people with a high genetic risk score compared to those with a low score, the study authors found.</p><p>However, people with a healthy lifestyle -- not smoking, not overweight, getting regular exercise, and eating a diet rich in fruit, vegetables and fish -- had a 66 percent lower risk of stroke than those with an unhealthy lifestyle.

He's a kidney transplant doctor and associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine.</p><p>The study shows that France is using kidneys from donors who are much older, on average, than in the United States.</p><p>\"Basically they're accepting donor kidneys that are much lower quality and higher risk,\" Reese said. \"To me, it shows that this other country with a very advanced health care system that looks a lot like our own in many ways is pushing the envelope on the donors and the transplants that they'll do, whereas we really aren't.\"</p><p>There currently are more than 95,000 people on the U.S. kidney transplant waiting list, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), the nonprofit that manages America's organ transplant system.</p> <p>Despite this shortage, approximately 2,000 donated kidneys are discarded each year, researchers said.</p><p>\"In the United States, there are a lot of kidneys that are procured but not transplanted,\" said Dr. David Klassen, chief medical officer for UNOS. \"As far as we can tell, there are some we believe really could be transplanted and should be transplanted.\"</p><p>To gain some insight into the issue, Reese worked with a French research team to compare the relative health of donated kidneys in each country and how the organs are used.</p><p>The researchers evaluated transplant data from 2004 to 2014, during which time more than 156,000 kidneys in the United States and nearly 30,000 kidneys in France were procured for transplant.</p><p>A much higher proportion of kidneys were higher-risk organs in France, scoring an average 65 on the Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI), compared with an average score of 42 for U.S. kidneys used in transplant.</p><p>Lower scores are associated with longer function. For example, kidneys with a KDPI between 0 and 20 are expected to function an average of 11.5 years, while those with a KDPI between 21 and 85 are expected to function about 9 years, according to the federal Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.</p><p>French surgeons tend to accept kidneys for transplantation from much older recipients, the researchers found.</p><p>\"The mean age of the French donors was 17 years older than the United States,\" Reese said. \"They are responding to the organ crisis by accepting older and older donors.\"</p><p>Accepted kidneys in France also tended to be more often from donors with chronic conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes, Reese said.</p><p>Because of this, the French average KDPI rose from 54 to 67 during the decade, while the U.S. average KDPI increased only from 42 to 44.</p><p>\"Over 10 years in the United States, there was really no change in the age of the donors and the quality of the donors,\" Reese said.</p><p>The United States could do a better job matching kidneys to recipients, even if the organs aren't the best quality, Reese concluded.</p><p>He gave the example of a kidney donated by an 80-year-old person.</p><p>\"It would be a mistake to take that kidney in the United States if the recipient is 30 years old, but we have people who are on our kidney transplant waiting list who are over 70,\" Reese said. \"If we tried hard, I don't think we would have too much difficulty finding appropriate recipients for these kidneys from older donors.\"</p><p>Klassen, who wasn't involved with the study, said that U.S. transplant centers tend to be risk-averse because they don't want to run afoul of regulators and endanger their certification.</p><p>\"Transplanting organs that might be viewed as higher risk into potential recipients who might be viewed as higher risk, transplant centers view that as something they would choose not to do,\" Klassen said.</p><p>To be fair, there are some donated organs that simply shouldn't be taken. \"Just because a kidney is procured and possibly could be transplanted doesn't mean that it should be,\" Klassen said.</p><p>There also are major differences in the organ donation and transplant system between France and the United States, in terms of how organ quality is judged and kidneys are biopsied at the time of organ offer. \"It's hard to say the results of one country would directly translate to another country,\" Klassen said.</p><p>But the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services tacitly admitted there's an oversight problem. The agency has put out for comment a rule change that would loosen its monitoring criteria, Klassen said.</p><p>\"They would look at other measures of program quality and not focus specifically on patient one-year outcomes as the sole measure of program quality,\" Klassen said. \"I don't think monitoring of patient and graft outcomes will ever go away, but I think using a broader palette of quality of measures would be an appropriate thing to do in terms of judging transplant programs.\"</p><p>The study was scheduled for presentation Sunday at the American Society of Nephrology's annual meeting, in San Diego. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network has more about the <a href=\"https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/resources/guidance/kidney-donor-profile-index-kdpi-guide-for-clinicians/\" target=\"_new\">Kidney Donor Profile Index</a>.</p>",

And that usually takes self-control, or the ability to resist temptation.</p><p>Think of self-control as the inner voice that keeps you from indulging in high-calorie food and prompts you to stick to your diet.</p><p>But having to constantly resist temptation can be exhausting and quickly use up the limited store of willpower you wake up with each day -- and which is at its lowest point at night when people typically need it most.</p><p>These steps can help you boost the self-control you need to lose weight.</p><p>Cravings are the enemy. They're usually a conditioned response. For instance, you smell the aroma of apple pie, the smell makes you want to eat it, and you grab a fork to act on that impulse. This is where the old saying, out of sight, out of mind, can help.</p><p>Scientists looked at people with high self-control and found that this ability was linked to avoiding -- rather than resisting -- temptation. This means making small but significant changes, such as altering the route you take to work to avoid passing a tempting bakery.</p><p>It's also important to avoid any activities that trigger your urge to eat. If watching TV goes hand-in-hand with snacking, limit TV time. Ditto if you usually munch while you surf the internet. Whenever you're facing a screen with free hands, replace eating with a non-food activity, like walking in place or knitting.</p><p>The third step is to reinforce self-control by writing out -- and constantly reminding yourself of -- the exact behaviors you're trying to change, noting the new behaviors needed to get there, and continually tracking your progress.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart Association has additional ideas to help you <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/WeightManagement/LosingWeight/Conquer-the-Craving---Learning-to-Resist-Temptation_UCM_427999_Article.jsp#.Wzghqy2ZOCQ\" target=\"_new\">conquer your cravings</a> in moments of weakness.</p>",

About half of the participants said they typically slept less than 6.3 hours a night.</p><p>The researchers noted a number of surprising findings. Most people who slept four hours or less performed as if they were almost nine years older, and the amount of sleep associated with the best test results was the same for all ages.</p><p>Reasoning and verbal abilities were two of the mental skills most strongly affected by sleep, while short-term memory was relatively unaffected by sleep patterns, the researchers said.</p><p>There was some evidence that even a single night's sleep can affect thinking abilities. Participants who slept more than usual the night before taking the tests did better than those who slept their usual amount or less.</p><p>The study was published Oct. 9 in the journal <i>Sleep</i>.</p><p>\"We really wanted to capture the sleeping habits of people around the entire globe. Obviously, there have been many smaller sleep studies of people in laboratories, but we wanted to find out what sleep is like in the real world,\" said study co-author Adrian Owen, a researcher in Cognitive Neuroscience and Imaging at the University of Western Ontario, Canada.</p><p>\"People who logged in gave us a lot of information about themselves. We had a fairly extensive questionnaire and they told us things like which medications they were on, how old they were, where they were in the world and what kind of education they'd received because these are all factors that might have contributed to some of the results,\" Owen explained in a university news release.</p><p>Study lead author Conor Wild, a research associate in Owen's lab, said, \"We found that the optimum amount of sleep to keep your brain performing its best is seven to eight hours every night, and that corresponds to what the doctors will tell you need to keep your body in tiptop shape, as well.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more on <a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Understanding-Sleep\" target=\"_new\">sleep</a>.</p>",

People whose noses have a lot of <i>Staphylococcus</i> bacteria had more severe nasal symptoms than those with less of this type of bacteria.</p><p>The bacteria inside the noses of the participants followed one of six different patterns, which were associated with variations in the severity of their symptoms. The mix of nasal bacteria was also linked with their viral load, or the amount of the virus in their body.</p><p>\"There were effects on virus load and how much virus you shed in your nasal secretions. So the background microbiome, the background bacterial pattern in your nose, had influences on the way that you reacted to the virus and how sick you got,\" said researcher Dr. Ronald Turner, who's with the University of Virginia School of Medicine. </p><p>But the researchers added that their findings don't prove a cause-and-effect relationship.</p><p>\"What we're reporting is an association, so it's entirely possible that the fact that you have staph in your nose and you have more symptoms is not directly related,\" Turner explained in a university news release. \"It may well be that there's some underlying host characteristic that makes you likely to have staph in your nose and also makes you more likely to become ill.\"</p><p>The researchers noted that the composition of nasal bacteria and the severity of people's symptoms could boil down to genetics.</p><p>\"Whether there are environmental characteristics that also influence it -- whether you're exposed to pollution or whether you're allergic or whether any number of things might impact it -- I don't know,\" Turner said. \"But I suspect there is some interaction among the host and the environment and the pathogen that determines what you end up with.\"</p><p>The study participants were also treated with probiotics to determine if beneficial bacteria would ease their symptoms or affect the composition of their nasal bacteria. Neither happened. It also didn't affect the microbiomes in their stomachs, Turner's team reported.</p><p>The researchers, who received funding from DuPont, the probiotic's manufacturer, suggested that a more direct approach, such as a probiotic nasal spray, could possibly have a more noticeable effect.</p><p>\"One of the things that would be interesting to ask, and this would be a completely different study, is, what happens if you give antibiotics?\" Turner said. \"Can you change the nasal flora by giving antibiotic? And is that a good thing or is that a bad thing? Those are all unknowns.\"</p><p>The findings were published recently in the journal <i>Scientific Reports</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides more on the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/features/rhinoviruses/index.html\" target=\"_new\">common cold</a>.</p>",

New research suggests this weekly routine might help.</p><p>The researchers found that taking two or more standard-dose (325 milligram) pills a week was associated with a 49 percent lower risk of liver cancer.</p><p>\"Regular use of aspirin led to significantly lower risk of developing [liver cancer], compared to infrequent or no aspirin use. And we also found that the risk declined progressively with increasing aspirin dose and duration of use,\" said lead study author Dr. Tracey Simon. She's a research fellow in gastroenterology at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.</p><p>It should be noted, however, that the study did not prove that aspirin reduced liver cause risk, just that there was an association. </p><p>For the study, researchers analyzed long-term data from more than 45,800 women and 87,500 men in the United States. </p><p>The investigators reported that aspirin's protective effect increased over time. Risk of liver cancer was 59 percent lower among those who took aspirin regularly for five years or more.</p><p>The risk reduction declined after people stopped taking aspirin, however. And it disappeared altogether eight years after aspirin was discontinued, the findings showed.</p><p>Regular use of acetaminophen (Tylenol) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) was not linked to reduced risk of liver cancer, according to the study. The results were published Oct. 4 in <i>JAMA Oncology</i>.</p><p>The findings support results from previous studies, the researchers said. </p><p>However, Simon said additional research is still needed. \"Since regular aspirin use carries the risk of increased bleeding, the next step should be to study its impact in populations with established liver disease, since that group is already at risk for primary liver cancer,\" she said in a hospital news release.</p><p>Liver cancer is relatively rare, but it has increased in the United States over the past 40 years. Also, liver cancer death rates have risen faster than those of any other cancer, the researchers noted.</p><p> Senior study author Dr. Andrew Chan pointed out that \"aspirin use is already recommended for prevention of heart disease and colorectal cancer in certain U.S. adults.\" Chan is the hospital's chief of clinical and translational epidemiology unit.</p><p>\"These data also add to a growing list of cancers for which aspirin appears to have anti-cancer activity,\" he said in the news release.</p><p>This could be a rationale for more patients to discuss an aspirin regimen with their doctors, Chan said. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Cancer Society has more on <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/liver-cancer/about/what-is-liver-cancer.html\" target=\"_new\">liver cancer</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Oct. 29, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Children may suffer delayed language skills if their mothers come in contact with common chemicals called phthalates in early pregnancy, new research suggests.</p><p>Phthalates are in countless products from nail polish and hair spray to food packaging and vinyl flooring. As plasticizers, they make things more pliable; as solvents, they enable other substances to dissolve. </p><p>In the new study, researchers found that the risk for language delay at about age 3 years was up to 30 percent higher among children whose mothers had higher exposure to two phthalates in particular: dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP). Both chemicals are in products such as older vinyl flooring, cosmetics and plastic toys.</p><p>\"Phthalates are known to be hormonally active and affect the body's hormone system,\" said researcher Shanna Swan, a professor of environmental and public health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.</p><p>Although the study cannot prove these chemicals cause delays in language development, Swan believes there is good reason to think they do. </p><p>Both DBP and BBP have been shown to lower testosterone in the mother during early pregnancy, Swan said. That helps explain how they can affect intellectual development, she noted.</p><p>Phthalates previously have been linked to developmental delays, lower IQ and underdeveloped male sex organs, the researchers said. </p><p>Because they are so commonplace, \"we are all exposed all the time,\" said lead researcher Carl-Gustaf Bornehag, a professor at Karlstad University in Sweden.</p><p>DBP and BBP are banned in many products, but they have very long life cycles. For example, vinyl flooring can be used for 20 to 30 years, meaning people are exposed for a very long time, he said.</p><p>Also, phthalates are routinely detected in indoor air, dust, food and water because they leach into the air, according to background notes with the study.</p><p>Swan said the only way to avoid these chemicals is to buy products labeled phthalate-free or to carefully read label ingredients.</p><p>However, steering clear of the chemicals is easier said than done, Bornehag pointed out.</p><p>\"It is often hard to get information about chemicals in products and articles, which makes it difficult to avoid exposure. We need better labeling systems,\" he said. </p><p>And Swan added that  banned phthalates have been replaced by similarly troublesome chemicals. </p><p>\"Manufacturers have taken out the worst offenders and put in a slight change, which changes its name, but they are equally hormonally active,\" she said. \"There have been some substitutions.\" </p><p>According to Steven Gilbert, director of the Institute of Neurotoxicology and Neurological Disorders, in Seattle, the real issue is that chemicals put into everyday household products are not regulated. </p><p>They're only tested and potentially banned when a problem arises after years of use, he said. </p><p>\"What we need to do is change the laws,\" Gilbert said. \"We've shown that these are bad actors and they cause cell changes, and we just need to stop using them.\" </p><p>The study involved pregnant women and their children who took part in long-term studies in Sweden or the United States. Nearly 1,000 mothers were in Sweden; 370 were in the United States.</p><p>Parents were asked about how many words their kids understood at about 30 months to 37 months of age. Children who understood 50 or fewer words were said to have a language delay.</p><p>Overall, 10 percent had a language delay, boys more often than girls, the researchers found. </p><p>Urine samples collected from the mothers in the 10th week of pregnancy revealed a correlation between phthalate exposure and language delay, according to the study. </p><p>The researchers said the results were statistically significant in the Swedish study, but not in the U.S. study. They believe the difference is probably due to the U.S. study's smaller sample size.</p><p>The report was published online Oct. 29 in <i>JAMA Pediatrics</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more about phthalates, visit the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/Phthalates_FactSheet.html\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

This is a growing concern as recreational marijuana becomes legal in more U.S. states, she added.</p><p>\"As we as a country move toward widespread legalization, we should pay attention to smart prevention programming for children,\" Schuster said.</p><p>The researchers cited a 2016 survey that found almost 14 percent of middle and high school students had used pot in the prior month. It also showed daily use doubling between eighth and 12th grades.</p>  <p>Maturation of critical parts of the brain occurs in adolescence, and regular pot use in those years may cause more harm than later use, the researchers said in background notes. </p><p>Marijuana legalization proponents countered that the new study supports their contention that the effects of pot are temporary.</p><p>\"These conclusions are consistent with those of prior studies finding that cannabis exposure is not likely to be associated with any sort of permanent adverse impact on the brain or cognitive performance,\" said Paul Armentano, deputy director of NORML.</p><p>\"These findings dispute the long-standing 'stoner-stupid' stereotype and should help to assuage fears that cannabis' acute effects on behavior may persist long after drug ingestion, or that they may pose greater potential risks to the developing brain,\" Armentano said.</p><p>For their study, Schuster and her colleagues asked two-thirds of a group of 88 marijuana users ages 16 to 25 to drop pot for a month.</p><p>The Boston-area participants were not all heavy users, but did use regularly. \"We have kids using a minimum of one day a week or more,\" Schuster said.</p><p>Urine tests revealed that 9 out of 10 participants did follow through on their promise to stop using pot for the study period.</p><p>Once a week, the young people took part in computerized brain games that tested their attention and memory, to see if stopping their pot use would help improve their brain function.</p><p>The computer tests showed that memory -- specifically the ability to learn and recall new information -- improved only among those who stopped using cannabis. The improvement occurred largely during the first week.</p><p>The study only showed an association between quitting pot and better learning ability, not a direct cause-and-effect relationship. Still, specialists are taking note of the findings.</p><p>\"Cannabis use impacts learning and memory, and this study showed improvement in these domains after quitting,\" said Dr. Scott Krakower, assistant unit chief of psychiatry at Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks, N.Y.</p><p>\"This research may motivate practitioners to encourage their patients to quit using marijuana and maintain abstinence,\" Krakower said.</p><p>However, quitting marijuana did not appear to affect the participants' ability to pay attention. Both groups performed similarly in that area.</p><p>Future studies will test whether this memory recovery brings marijuana quitters back to full function by comparing them with teens who've never used in the first place, Schuster said.</p><p>\"What we don't know is, by that one week are they back to the levels of their non-using peers, or is there a deficit that's still measurable?\" Schuster said.</p><p>The study appears in the Oct. 30 <i>Journal of Clinical Psychiatry</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse has more about <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/what-are-marijuanas-long-term-effects-brain\" target=\"_new\">marijuana's long-term effects on the brain</a>.</p>",

He's clinical professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at the University of Miami. </p><p>Water appears to work its magic \"presumably via the flushing effect of increased urine volume, but there may be other effects we are not aware of,\" Hooton said in a university news release.</p><p>One specialist in women's health said the UTI-fighting benefits of hydrating with H2O have long been suspected, but not confirmed in a clinical trial until now.</p><p>\"Ask anyone who's had even one UTI, they are no fun,\" said Dr. Jill Rabin, who helps direct Women's Health Services at Northwell Health in New Hyde Park, N.Y. </p><p> \"In this study, women were included if they'd had three or more episodes in the prior year -- definitely painful and life-disrupting,\" noted Rabin, who wasn't involved in the new study. </p><p>\"Drinking more water to improve one's health is probably safe and, if tap is used, pretty inexpensive,\" she added. \"Producing additional urine -- and thus increasing voiding frequency  -- may raise one's awareness of the importance of keeping the bladder as empty as possible, which can help reduce UTIs.\" </p><p>The new trial included 140 younger, premenopausal women in Europe who had all experienced high numbers of recurrent UTIs. Their total daily fluid intake at the start of the study totaled less than six 8-ounce glasses per day.</p><p>During the year-long trial, half of the women drank just over six cups more each day of water, in addition to their regular daily fluid intake. Intake remained the same for the other half of women.</p><p>The reduction in UTI frequency for those who drank the additional water was significant. While  the average number of UTIs during the study period was 3.2  for women who did not increase their water intake, it fell to 1.7 for those women whose intake rose, the findings showed.</p><p>There was also a significant reduction in antibiotic use among the women who drank more water. Antibiotics are the main treatment of UTIs, and cutting down on the overuse of antibiotics is key to curbing the emergence of microbes resistant to the drugs.</p><p>Hooton said the trial was long overdue.</p><p>\"While it's been widely assumed that increased water intake helps to flush out bacteria and reduce the risk of recurrent UTI, there has been no supporting research data showing such a beneficial effect of water,\" he said.</p><p>The study did not determine the ideal amount of daily water intake to reduce the risk of UTIs, or whether boosting water intake would help women who are at a lower risk of recurrent UTIs than the group chosen for this trial.</p><p>Dr. Elizabeth Kavaler is a urology specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. She said the trial highlights the notion that \"water is the preferred beverage for overall bladder and kidney health.\" She added that \"the amount that we each need depends on the environment, activity level and diet.\"</p><p>The study was published online Oct. 1 in <i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i>.

He's an epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital's division of sleep and circadian disorders, in Boston.</p><p>Compared to eight-hour-a-night sleepers, those who averaged less than six hours a night were twice as likely to say they had smoked cigarettes, used alcohol, marijuana or other drugs, or had driven after  drinking. They were also three times more likely to consider or attempt suicide, and almost twice as likely to carry a weapon or to fight, the researchers found.</p><p>\"Many of these behaviors are common precursors to accidents and suicides, which are the leading causes of death for teens in the U.S.,\" added Weaver. </p><p>The findings are based on an analysis of 2007-2015 data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveys. Nearly 68,000 high schoolers were involved in all. About 6 in 10 were white, and they attended public and private schools.</p><p>The researchers found that less than one-third of the students were getting eight or more hours of sleep on weeknights. Twenty-two percent said they logged about six hours daily, while about 18 percent reported less than six hours of sleep on average.</p><p>Weaver cautioned, however, that while the survey suggests \"an association between sleep and these behaviors,\" it cannot prove cause and effect. It's possible that kids who engage in risky behavior may undermine the quantity and quality of their sleep, rather than the other way around, he said.</p><p>Also, because the information was self-reported, it might not be completely reliable.</p><p>Nevertheless, Weaver said it's critical to ensure that teens get enough sleep.</p><p>\"Insufficient sleep in youth raises multiple public health concerns, including mental health, substance abuse, and motor vehicle crashes,\" he said. He added that more research is needed to determine the specific relationships between sleep and these behaviors.</p><p>Parents can help, Weaver noted. Be aware of what time homework and other activities must end so kids can get eight to 10 hours in bed.</p><p>\"Limiting the use of [electronic] devices at night can also be helpful. These activities are engaging and tend to lead to later bedtimes,\" he added.</p><p>The study findings appear in a letter to the editor in the Oct. 1 issue of <i>JAMA Pediatrics</i>.</p><p>Dr. Nathaniel Watson is a professor of neurology at the University of Washington Medicine Sleep Center in Seattle.</p><p>\"The single best way to address this problem is to delay school start times,\" said Watson, past president of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.</p><p>\"Adolescent physiology is such that bedtimes before 11 p.m. can be difficult,\" he said. \"So later school start times allow a bedtime of 11 p.m., and at least eight hours of sleep.\"</p><p>Watson advised parents to attend school board meetings to push for later school start times. Starting at 8:30 a.m. or after would benefit student health and well-being, he added.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on teens and sleep at the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072503/\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institutes of Health</a>.</p>",

Conservative estimates say that 19 percent of adults put in 48 hours or more a week and 7 percent log in 60 or more.</p><p>But what you might not realize is that, after a certain point, extra hours could be hurting both your health and your productivity.</p><p>In addition to a variety of medical issues and unhealthy lifestyle choices associated with long hours, a British study used cognitive tests to show that working 55 hours a week was associated with lower scores in vocabulary and reasoning, and can lead to cognitive problems as you get older.</p><p>Adding insult to injury, research done at Stanford University found that, besides the personal toll that overtime takes, you probably aren't working effectively. Productivity starts to fall considerably after the 50th work hour of the week and gets worse with every additional hour. So, if you put in 70 hours a week, you're not likely to accomplish anything worthwhile during those last 15.</p><p>One reason for this is that you might be too stressed or tired to function at peak level since working overtime usually results in your getting less sleep -- and that in turn leads to making mistakes that can set you back at work.</p><p>Take action to improve the balance between your personal life and your work life. Prioritize responsibilities and focus on the most important ones. Assert more control over time-draining tasks like answering emails. If you check your email every few minutes, cut down to every half hour or just scan the subject lines and open the most essential ones.</p><p>And when you must stay late, make getting sleep a priority so that you'll be well rested when you're back at work in the morning.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has an archive of webinars on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/workschedules/webinars.html\" target=\"_new\">the hazards of working overtime</a>, as well as how to get better sleep.</p>",

For most of us, dry skin makes an appearance in the winter due to changes in temperature and humidity, so you need to think about appropriate skin care formulations,\" said Dr.  Rajani Katta. She's a clinical professor of dermatology with the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.</p><p>Katta and her colleague, Dr. Megan Rogge, an assistant professor of dermatology at the university, offered these tips to protect your skin:</p><ul> <li><b>Choose thick skin creams over watery lotions.</b> \"Lotions are the least moisturizing, because they have such a high quantity of water. Creams are a better choice for those with dry skin,\" Katta said in a university news release.</li><li><b>Use sunblock.</b> Rogge explained that \"even when the temperature drops, the sun's rays can still emit powerful ultraviolet radiation. If you're close to snow or water, those UV rays can be even more potent due to the reflective surfaces, which makes wearing protection paramount.\"</li><li><b>Don't take long, hot showers.</b>  \"Many of us love to linger longer in steaming hot showers, particularly when it's cold outside. These feel great, especially when your skin is itchy,\" Rogge added. \"But this can actually damage your skin barrier, and also exacerbate dry, itchy skin. That's why it's recommended to limit showers to 10 minutes, and use lukewarm water instead of hot water.\"</li><li><b>Soak and smear to help lock moisture into your skin.</b> Katta said, \"After soaking your skin, you want to smear on your moisturizer. In other words, after you take a shower, you'll step out of the shower, pat dry just a little bit, then apply a moisturizer while your skin is still damp.\"</li><li><b>Wear gloves.</b> \"An important part of looking after your skin is using the right protective gear,\" Katta noted. \"Gloves keep your fingers warm and protect them, too.\" </li><li><b>Use a humidifier in your home.</b> According to Rogge, \"Winter dry skin gets worse once you start turning on the heat in your home. That heat starts to dry the air in your home, which in turn starts to dry your skin.

The patient is now in isolation, the wire service reported.</p><p>Mikael Kohler, chief medical officer for the Uppsala region, said the patient visited \"mostly urban areas in Burundi, where there isn't thought to be any active Ebola as far as we know.\"</p><p>However, upon arrival at the hospital in Enkoping the patient displayed symptoms of Ebola infection, including vomiting blood, Kohler said.  Test results are expected by 12 p.m. ET, he added.</p><p>The emergency room where the patient was cared for has been closed, and any staff who had contact with the patient are being monitored, officials said.</p><p>Ebola is caused by a virus and can cause fever, hemorrhaging and severe headaches. It is fatal in about half of cases.</p><p>There's an outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which borders Burundi, with case numbers topping 600 by Wednesday, <i>CNN</i> reported.  The largest Ebola outbreak occurred in 2014 in West Africa and claimed more than 11,000 lives.</p><p>In related news, Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha is currently monitoring an American who was potentially exposed to Ebola whole providing medical assistance in the Congo, <i>CNN</i> said.</p><p>In a Dec. 29 statement, Dr. Ted Cieslak, an infectious disease specialist at the medical center,  said \"the person may have been exposed to the virus but is not ill and is not contagious.\"</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Social Media Tied to Depression in Teens, Especially Girls</b></span></p><p>Using social media for five hours or more per day is tied to a big jump in risk for depression among 14-year-olds, and especially for girls, a new British study shows.</p><p>As compared to girls who spent just one to three hours daily on social media, girls who spent five or more hours on Snapchat, Instagram and the like had 50 percent higher odds for depressive symptoms, says a team from University College London.</p><p>The number was somewhat less for boys -- a 35 percent hike in risk for boys who used social media five-plus hours per day.</p><p>\"We were quite surprised when we saw the figures and we saw those raw percentages: the fact that the magnitude of association was so much larger for girls than for boys,\" study author Yvonne Kelly, a professor of epidemiology and public health at the university, told <i>CNN</i>.</p><p>The researchers stressed that the study couldn't prove that excessive social media use caused depressive symptoms, only that there was an association. Depressive symptoms included feelings of loneliness, unhappiness or restlessness.</p><p>The researchers looked at data from a national study that included nearly 11,000 British 14-year-olds born between 2000 and 2002.</p><p>The data showed that girls were typically on social media more than boys: about 43 percent of girls used social media three or more hours per day, compared to about 22 percent of boys.</p><p>\"For both girls and boys, the more social media they use, the more likely they are to have mental health problems, but not that many studies have been able to look for the explanations why,\" Kelly told <i>CNN</i>.</p><p>\"We looked at four potential explanations simultaneously, and this is the first paper to do that. We looked at sleeping habits; experiences online, so cyberbullying; how they thought about their bodies, or their body image, and whether they were happy with how they looked; and their self-esteem,\" she explained.</p><p>\"All of those four things -- the sleep, the cyberharassment, the body image or happiness with appearance, and the self-esteem -- they are all linked with the risk of having depression,\" Kelly said.</p><p>She noted that girls tend to gravitate towards Instagram and Snapchat. Those platforms are \"more based around physical appearance, taking photographs and commenting on those photographs,\" she said, so the stronger link between social media and depression in girls may have \"to do with the nature of use.\"</p><p>The findings were published Jan. 3 in <i>EClinicalMedicine</i>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 16, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Comfort-inducing seasonal drinks abound during the fall and winter. From the sweet, spicy goodness of pumpkin spice latte -- PSL to its fans on Instagram -- to peppermint-flavored, well, everything. </p> <p>But the calories are everywhere, too.  </p> <p>And, experts say, those liquid calories can be more problematic than the ones we get from solid food. Some studies have shown that we feel less full from liquid calories, so we may consume more than we should.</p> <p>\"We are less sensitive to liquid calories than we are to solid calories,\" said Marie-Pierre St-Onge, an associate professor of nutritional medicine at Columbia University. \"The calories from solid food tend to produce greater signals for fullness, making it easier to adjust our caloric intakes. With liquids, those signals are weaker and that's how you can get into trouble in terms of overconsumption.\"</p> <p>Just one 16-ounce pumpkin spice latte with 2 percent milk and whipped cream contains about 380 calories, with 14 grams of fat and a whopping 50 grams of sugar.</p> <p>It's not just a PSL problem. All sorts of seasonal drinks pack in the calories, from peppermint mocha, chai latte and sugary apple cider to eggnog and warmed-up cocktails. Alcohol, though, also lowers inhibitions, which can lead to overeating  among other unhealthy behaviors.</p> <p>Spices and flavors such as peppermint, pumpkin, ginger, cloves or cinnamon can give almost any drink a seasonal twist. The challenge is finding a drink that's healthy on its own, with or without the spices.</p> <p>\"Pumpkin spice is virtually no calories, it's one or two calories,\" said Judith Wylie-Rosett, a professor and division head for health promotion and nutrition research at New York's Albert Einstein College of Medicine. But when you put in syrups and milk, \"the latte can be very high in calories.\" </p> <p>Some ways to make traditional cold-weather favorites a little healthier: </p> <ul> <li>Ask your barista for fewer pumps of syrup  one instead of three  or simply use spices instead of flavored syrup if making your own drink at home.</li> <li>Use plant-based or low-fat milk instead of whole or condensed milk.</li> <li>Choose black coffee or espresso instead of a milky latte, then add spices to create seasonal flavors.</li> <li>Buy hot chocolate mix without vegetable oil.</li> <li>Skip the whipped cream on top.</li> </ul> <p>Generally, homemade drinks tend to be healthier, St-Onge said, because you're able to control how much sweetener you put in. </p> <p>Milk can be an important ingredient because it adds vitamin D, which is needed in the fall and winter months as days become shorter and colder and as people spend less time exercising outside. So, choosing fat-free or low-fat milk over whole milk as an ingredient is one easy solution.</p> <p>There are other sources of vitamin D as well. St-Onge said fall and winter are good times to experiment with putting fruits and vegetables  as well as seasonal spices  into smoothies, although she cautioned that people may not get all the health benefits of foods when they're liquefied. </p> <p>Regardless of the season, St-Onge said, people shouldn't look to drinks as a source of energy. </p> <p>\"The calories from solid food tend to produce greater signals for fullness, making it easier to adjust our caloric intakes. With liquids, those signals are weaker and that's how you can get into trouble in terms of overconsumption.\"</p> <p>Research shows to get the cozy effect of a typical cold-weather drink, you may not even have to consume it at all. A University of Colorado study a decade ago found people who hold warm beverages are judged as having a warmer personality.</p> <p>\"The feelings of warmth when one holds a hot cup of coffee or takes a warm bath might activate memories of other feelings associated with warmth (trust and comfort),\" researchers wrote, \"because of early experiences with caretakers who provide warmth, shelter, safety, and nourishment.\"</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Oct. 19, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Gerard Blaney figured his excruciating headache was simply due to a combination of too much stress and too little food. It was budget season at Einstein Healthcare Network in Philadelphia, and as the network's chief financial officer, his entire lunch that day in April 2016 consisted of a single pretzel.</p> <p>He arrived home that evening hungry, hurting and harried.</p> <p>\"He looked awful,\" said his wife, Mariann.</p> <p>Hoping food would help him feel better, the couple and their then-23-year-old daughter, Chelsea, headed to a restaurant. But as soon as they were seated, Gerard put his head down on the table. His bad headache was worse, he was sweating and the burning that had been in his chest was now in his throat. Before they could even place their orders, he told his family that he needed to go home.</p> <p>Although Gerard had driven to the restaurant, he handed the keys to Mariann and climbed into the back seat to lie down. Mariann figured he was suffering from an allergy-related headache and prepared to drive home.</p> <p>\"Mom, whatever you do, don't go home,\" Chelsea whispered.</p> <p>Chelsea suggested going to a hospital. Mariann agreed. Gerard did, too, but on one condition: The only place he would go was Einstein, where he'd worked for 35 years. But it was 40 minutes away.</p> <p>Mariann agreed, although she also formulated a Plan B.</p> <p>\"I was prepared to call 911 if I had to,\" she said.</p> <p>Fortunately, the backup plan was not needed. When they arrived, a team of health professionals was waiting, and they whisked away her husband.</p> <p>Cardiologist Dr. Lynn Morris evaluated Gerard and broke the news to him. He was having a heart attack.</p> <p>\"I'm not having a heart attack,\" Gerard said.</p> <p>\"Yes, you are,\" Morris said. \"I know a little more than you.\"</p> <p> Even though an older brother had recently had a heart attack, Gerard didn't consider himself at risk. He never smoked and rarely drank. He exercised regularly and had been taking cholesterol-lowering medicine for years. Plus, he wasn't experiencing typical heart attack symptoms such as arm or chest pain.</p> <p>\"It was probably hard-headedness on my side,\" he said. \"When they're going to rush you right into the emergency room and you're only 59 years old and think you're in pretty good health, it's hard to accept that you're having a heart attack.\"</p> <p>Morris found the \"culprit artery\" and was able to open the blockage. In doing so, he noticed more disease in another artery, prompting coronary bypass surgery days later.</p> <p>About three weeks after the heart attack, Gerard was back at work, though in a limited capacity. Soon after, he was able to attend the graduation of his younger daughter, Cailin, from Penn State University.</p> <p>Today, Gerard exercises more and tries to eat better, opting for turkey burgers instead of hamburgers. And while he is still swamped with work, he's picked up one additional responsibility: chair of the Philadelphia Heart Walk on Oct. 27.</p> <p>Gerard said the information he's received preparing for the American Heart Association's flagship event has helped not only him, but his extended family as well. Now he hopes to help others remain heart-healthy, too.</p> <p>\"The big moral of the story is, if you have symptoms and aren't feeling right, you have to get to the doctor,\" he said.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 21, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Does your teenager's personality actually predict how long he or she will live?</p><p>Yes, claims new research that finds high school students who tend to be calm, empathetic and intellectually curious are more likely to still be alive 50 years later than their peers who are less so.</p><p>The finding does not prove that certain traits in adolescence actually cause people to live longer; it only reveals an association between the two.</p><p>But the conclusion stems from an in-depth analysis of personality surveys conducted in 1960,  involving nearly 27,000 high school students across the United States. Those results were then stacked up against participant deaths due to all causes over nearly 50 years.</p><p>\"Essentially, we find that high school students who report adaptive personality characteristics -- things like high levels of calmness and low levels of impulsivity -- have a lower risk of death over the ensuing half century,\" said study author Benjamin Chapman. He is an associate professor in the departments of psychiatry and public health sciences at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.</p><p>In addition to calmness and impulsivity, the initial survey gauged teenage levels of social sensitivity;  leadership; energetic disposition; self-confidence; tidiness; sociability; intellectual curiosity; and maturity.</p><p>Chapman said his team \"looked initially at each trait one by one.\" That meant that calmness was linked to a reduced risk of early death, whether or not the same teen also possessed other protective or risky traits.</p><p>Still, \"adolescents who are more sociable tended also to be more self-confident, and so forth,\" he observed, suggesting that some traits tend to group together in the same person.</p><p>Chapman also noted that personality traits were assessed on a spectrum, so that each teen was characterized as having relatively high or low levels of a particular trait. And that meant that the degree to which a teenage trait was associated with a lower premature death risk also fell across a continuum.</p><p>For example, highly mature teens saw their long-term risk for an early death fall by about 6 percent for every statistically significant move up along the maturity spectrum; it fell by 8 percent for every notable bump in calmness and energetic disposition.</p><p>Bigger trait differences would likely produce even more dramatic protective benefits, the study authors suggested.</p><p>The findings were published online Nov. 20  in the <i>Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health</i>.</p><p>The initial personality survey asked more than 377,000 high schoolers to complete a battery of psychological tests back in 1960.</p><p>Death records dating up to 2009 were obtained for nearly 27,000 of them. By that point, 13 percent had died. The team did not assess specific causes of death.</p><p>And regardless of a teen's ethnic or family background, those who scored higher in terms of energy, empathy, calmness, tidiness, intellectual curiosity and maturity -- as well as lower for impulsivity -- faced a lower risk of death over the 48-year period.</p><p>\"The insight of this work is that characteristics that we think are not particularly helpful in teens for immediate outcomes -- like getting good grades, getting into college, adjusting socially and emotionally to everyday life -- actually can have very long-term health consequences,\" said Chapman.</p><p>\"The good news is that people can and often do change,\" he added. \"There are many points in life between high school and a half-century later where chains of negative events can be halted or reversed in a sense.\"</p><p>Kit Yarrow is professor emeritus of psychology at Golden Gate University in San Francisco. She suggested the findings make intuitive sense.</p><p>\"Human connection is strongly correlated with health and happiness, so it's no surprise that those with more empathy -- our social glue -- would fare better,\" she said.</p><p>\"Meanwhile, impulsivity is dangerous,\" Yarrow added. \"[And] people with stronger personal control are more likely to avoid substances and reckless behavior which are detrimental to health.\"</p><p>By contrast, \"a calmer, more mature person will make better lifestyle choices that have long-reaching consequences,\" she said.</p><p>William Chopik, an assistant professor of psychology at Michigan State University, agreed that personality drives the everyday health decisions that ultimately impact longevity.</p> <p>\"Personality is pervasive in predicting everything about us,\" he said. \"Who we think we are, what we achieve, the type of job we have, how we deal with stress, whether our relationships last. And now, thanks to this and other research projects, how long we live.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on mental outlook and health at the <a href=\"https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2015/08/positive-emotions-your-health\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institutes of Health</a>.</p>",

But according to a new report, 75 percent of supplements tested still contain the  compounds.</p><p>\"Consumers turn to supplements for safe, natural ways to increase energy, improve workouts or lose weight,\" said study author Dr. Pieter Cohen, an associate professor with Harvard Medical School. \"[But] what most consumers don't know is that supplements can be sold as if they give you energy, help you lose weight or just about anything, as long as the supplement does not claim to cure or treat disease.\"</p><p>His team's findings centered on four unapproved stimulants: DMAA, DMBA, BMPEA and oxilofrine.</p><p>The four have become replacements for the stimulant ephedra, which the FDA banned from supplements in 2004 following reports that it raised the risk for heart attack, stroke and death.</p><p>Between 2013 and 2016, the FDA found that 12 different supplement brands contained one or more of the four unapproved stimulants. But despite public notice warnings from the agency, three-quarters of the supplements still contained at least one prohibited stimulant in 2017. And half contained two or more.</p><p>The finding raises fresh concerns about supplement safety, and comes on the heels of another troubling analysis published just last week by the California Department of Public Health's Food and Drug Branch.</p><p>That investigation revealed that the FDA had issued more than 700 warnings over the last decade about potentially hazardous ingredients found in supplements promoted as sexual, weight-loss and muscle growth aids.</p><p>But because the FDA classifies dietary supplements as a food -- rather than as drugs -- supplement manufacturers do not have to prove a supplement is safe or effective before selling it to the public.</p><p>If, however, the FDA ultimately determines that a supplement already on the market is potentially hazardous, it can recall the product or issue a \"public notice\" concerning problematic ingredients.</p><p>In a letter published online Oct. 22 in the journal <i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i>, Cohen and his colleagues point to an earlier study that suggests that FDA recalls, for one, are largely ineffective.</p><p>The latest investigation focused on the effectiveness of public notice warnings, and found equally poor results.</p><p>\"The FDA seems to imagine that if they simply request that firms remove an experimental stimulant from commerce, the stimulant will be removed,\" Cohen said. \"Clearly this is wishful thinking on the part of the FDA.\"</p><p>Cohen noted that he and his associates conducted two analyses of 12 supplements previously issued public notices for unapproved ingredients.</p><p>The first analysis took place in 2014. At that time, all 12 supplements contained at least one of the four prohibited stimulants.</p><p>The second analysis took place in 2017. At that point, nine of the 12 brands contained at least one prohibited supplement and six contained two.</p><p>The team also pointed out that although DMBA had not been found in any of the 12 supplements in 2014, it <i>was</i> found in a third of the supplements in 2017, two years <i>after</i> the FDA issued a public notice raising concern about the ingredient.</p><p>\"Until the law is reformed and the FDA aggressively enforces the law, these potentially dangerous ingredients will likely remain in supplements,\" said Cohen.</p><p>Dr. Mitchell Katz is president and CEO of NYC Health and Hospitals in New York City, and author of an accompanying editorial. He suggested that the upshot is that the FDA is hamstrung in what it can do.</p><p>\"The FDA is not allowed by federal law to investigate a product before it is marketed,\" Katz noted. \"Therefore, all that the FDA can do under current law is respond to complaints and issue guidelines of what can and cannot be in supplements.\"</p><p>The bottom line, said Katz, is that \"people should know that the supplements they are taking are not tested [and] may contain substances that are not on the label.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on supplement regulations at <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/food/dietarysupplements\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Oct. 2, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The most dangerous play in football can be rendered safer through a simple rule change, a new study out of the Ivy League suggests.</p><p>Moving the kickoff line forward by just five yards -- from the 35- to the 40-yard line -- reduced the average annual concussion rate in Ivy League football by more than 68 percent, the study revealed.</p><p>That change makes players less likely to run the ball forward, eliminating the potential for high-speed collisions during kickoff returns, said study author Douglas Wiebe, director of the Penn Injury Science Center at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>\"At the end of the day, the results are really quite compelling,\" Wiebe said.</p><p>Kickoff returns account for more concussions than any other play in football.</p><p>In 2015, kickoffs accounted for 6 percent of all plays during a game but 21 percent of all concussions in the Ivy League, the researchers said.</p><p>Statistics compiled by the National Football League (NFL) show that concussions are five times more likely to happen during kickoffs, <i>ESPN</i> has reported.</p><p>\"Players on the receiving team have the time and space to get up to full speed running forward. Players on the team that just kicked the ball are running at full speed toward them,\" Wiebe said. \"High-speed high-impact collisions are just quite likely to occur during this type of play, relative to other types of play.\"</p><p>Because of this, the Ivy League in 2016 decided to move the kickoff line forward five yards.</p><p>\"The rationale is it would give the kickers a better chance for the ball to reach or go beyond the end zone,\" Wiebe said. \"Players would be more likely to take a knee rather than move the ball forward.\"</p><p>Kickoffs happen frequently during a football game, including at the start of each half and after a scoring play.</p><p>One team kicks the ball to the other. The receiving team tries to get the football as far back down field as possible, while the opposing team tries to tackle the ball carrier as quickly as possible.</p><p>But if the kicked ball goes past the goal line, the receiving team can decide to \"take a knee\" and down the ball in what is called a \"touchback.\" Play then starts with the ball placed at a set position on the field, which in the Ivy League is the 20-yard line.</p><p>Ivy League coaches asked for the kickoff line to be moved forward, likely with the idea that more kicks would go past the goal line and more ball receivers would take a touchback instead of running the ball forward, said co-researcher Bernadette D'Alonzo, a clinical research coordinator with Penn Injury Science.</p><p>Results from the 2016 and 2017 seasons show that the rule change paid off, the study authors noted.</p><p>Kickoff plays resulting in a touchback increased from an average 18 percent annually to 48 percent after the rule change, meaning fewer instances of high-speed collisions, the researchers reported.</p><p>As a result, the rate of concussions during kickoff plays went from 10.9 per 1,000 plays down to 2 per 1,000 plays, Wiebe said.</p><p>To make sure this was the result of the rule change, the researchers compared kickoffs to a control group consisting of all other football plays during the season.</p><p>They found that for other play types, the concussion rate went from 2.5 per 1,000 down to 1.2 per 1,000 following the rule change.</p><p>\"Over time, there was a small reduction in the rate of concussion in other play types, but after pulling that out and accounting for it, we still see that evidently the kickoff rule appears to explain there was a reduction in kickoff return concussions to the tune of 7.5 fewer per 1,000,\" Wiebe said.</p><p>The NFL already moved its own kickoff line forward in 2011, from the 30- to the 35-yard line, in an attempt to limit concussions, the researchers noted. One analysis concluded that the NFL's change reduced injuries overall but not head injuries, but the prior study did not compare kickoffs against all other play types.</p><p>The NFL is considering eliminating the kickoff altogether if it can't be made safer, <i>ESPN</i> has reported.</p><p>The Ivy League study is \"great news,\" said Kristen Dams-O'Connor, director of the Brain Injury Research Center at Mount Sinai, in New York City.</p><p>\"This is a really great example of how this much-loved sport can be made safer,\" Dams-O'Connor said.</p><p>Another sports safety expert agreed.</p><p>The rule change makes a great deal of sense, given how dangerous kickoff plays can be, said Dr. Michael Stuart, co-director of sports medicine at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minn.</p><p>\"When I played football, we were taught on kickoffs on punts that you had to play with reckless abandon, complete disregard for personal safety,\" Stuart said. \"You had to run as fast as you could down the field and knock anyone out of the way who was trying to block you, and try to be the first one to the kickoff returner and tackle them at high speed.\"</p><p>However, Stuart noted that even on touchbacks, the rest of the team still is running toward each other at full tilt until they get word the play has ended.</p><p>\"Clearly, the kickoff returner is not at risk of concussion, but the other 21 players can still be involved in high-speed contacts. That's an important recognition,\" Stuart said, adding that any discussion of potentially abandoning kickoffs should weigh this fact.</p><p>The findings were published online Oct. 1 as a research letter in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about <a href=\" https://www.cdc.gov/headsup/youthsports/index.html\" target=\"_new\">sports-related concussions</a>.</p>",

But the rates of infection were seven times higher in people with diabetes, she added.</p><p>The rise in overall infections is largely driven by increases in patients who develop sepsis while in the hospital, Harding said. \"However, we also see in people with diabetes an increase in foot ulcers, coinciding with an increase in lower limb amputations,\"  she added.</p><p>Dr. Louis Philipson, director of the University of Chicago Kovler Diabetes Center, said it isn't clear why diabetics develop more infections.</p><p>\"We do not even have data as to whether the infections occurred in people with more poorly controlled diabetes, though that seems like a reasonable guess,\" said Philipson, who is also  president-elect for medicine and science at the American Diabetes Association.</p><p>High blood sugar decreases the activity of the immune system and can cause many changes in tissue, skin and blood flow, all of which can increase the risk of infections, Philipson said.  </p><p>\"Exactly which factors are most important here, and whether access to health care played a role, we do not know yet,\" he added.</p><p>Urinary tract, skin and connective tissue infections are associated with high blood sugar levels and poorly controlled diabetes, Philipson explained. Preventing diabetes and reaching the optimum targets for blood sugar control are key to reducing infections.</p><p>\"Along with that, regular visits to a primary care doctor and specialist as needed to get the best foot care, eye care and review of kidney function will go a long way towards preventing complications of diabetes,\" Philipson said.</p><p>For the study, Harding and her colleagues used national hospitalization data from 2000 to 2015. The data captured about 20 percent of all hospitalizations in 46 states, representing more than 96 percent of the U.S. population.</p><p>The investigators found that people with diabetes are about two to seven times more likely to be hospitalized with an infection than the general population.</p><p>\"Improved access to preventive care, as well as promoting education to reduce risk factors for underlying disease processes, will be essential to decrease the risk of infections in people with diabetes,\" Harding said.</p><p>Dr. Joel Zonszein directs the Clinical Diabetes Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. He  said it's concerning that the majority of patients with diabetes are not treated properly, since high blood sugar levels predispose them to infections.</p><p>\"We have proper ways to treat diabetes, and there should be no excuse why patients shouldn't be getting the best care,\" he said. \"More research is not needed -- more effective treatment is imperative.\"</p><p>The results of the study were scheduled for presentation Tuesday at the meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, in Berlin. Research presented at medical meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/type-2/\" target=\"_new\"> American Diabetes Association</a> for more on type 2 diabetes.</p>",

But why are blacks more likely to develop high blood pressure?</p><p>The new study suggests the key factor is the traditional Southern diet -- with its deep-fried foods, pecan pies and other tasty but nutritionally dubious fare.</p><p>In fact, the diet explained more than half the excess risk of high blood pressure among black men, versus white men. Among women, the eating pattern was less important, but still explained almost 30 percent of the disparity between black and white women, according to the findings.</p><p>Diet has a critical effect on blood pressure, regardless of race, said lead researcher George Howard, of the University of Alabama at Birmingham.</p><p>But this study, he said, shows that it accounts for much of the black-white racial disparity in high blood pressure.</p><p>\"We were absolutely surprised by how important this factor was,\" Howard said.</p><p>And that can be seen as good news, he added.</p><p>\"Diet is something you can change,\" Howard pointed out. \"This is not all because of underlying genetics or other factors you can't change.\"</p><p>The research is based on nearly 6,900 older U.S. adults who were followed for roughly nine years. At the outset, they were 62 years old, on average, and free of high blood pressure.</p><p>By the end of the study, 46 percent of black participants had been diagnosed with high blood pressure, versus one-third of whites.</p><p>When Howard's team looked for explanations for the discrepancy, they found that the Southern diet seemed to be the single most important one.</p><p>The impact was clearer among men. There was no major difference in body mass index (BMI) or waist size between black and white men, Howard said. On the other hand, Southern-style eating explained 52 percent of the racial disparity in high blood pressure risk.</p><p>The picture was somewhat different for women. Black women had a higher average BMI and waist size than white women -- and those were two key factors in their higher blood pressure. (BMI is a measure of weight in relation to height.)</p><p>However, the Southern diet explained 29 percent of the racial disparity in women's risk of high blood pressure.</p><p>The diet mattered independent of any effects on weight and belt size. So its nutritional components may bear much of the blame, according to the researchers.</p><p>Besides deep-fried fare, the traditional Southern diet is heavy in processed meats, eggs, high-fat dairy, sugary treats and bread.</p><p>\"There's no doubt the Southern diet is like a sodium pill,\" said Howard, adding he grew up on it himself.</p><p>On top of that, he said, it's lacking in the fruits and vegetables, fiber-rich grains, healthy fats and other foods that help keep the heart and blood vessels healthy.</p><p> The study was published Oct. 2 in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>. </p><p>Cordialis Msora-Kasago is a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. She, too, was surprised by the findings.</p><p>\"The figures were really striking,\" Msora-Kasago said. \"And this is good news, because diet can be modified.\"</p><p>That does not mean people have to abandon comfort foods to become vegetarians, added Msora-Kasago, who was not involved with the study.</p><p>\"The Southern diet isn't just an eating pattern,\" she said. \"It's called 'soul food,' because it's part of a culture and tradition.\"</p><p>Fortunately, she said, it's possible to make healthier versions of Southern favorites. People can cut down on salt, and season with herbs and spices instead. They can reduce the amount of meat in dishes, and add more vegetables.</p><p>\"It's important that the changes fit into a person's lifestyle so they are sustainable,\" Msora-Kasago said.</p><p>African-Americans are at \"extraordinary risk\" of heart disease and stroke, Howard said, noting that's largely due to high blood pressure.</p><p>\"So preventing high blood pressure,\" he said, \"is the key to reducing that disparity.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has advice on <a href=\"https://www.eatright.org/food\" target=\"_new\">making healthier meals</a>.</p>",

The findings showed that while the average life span of black and yellow Labrador Retrievers is 12  years, the median life span of chocolate Labs was at least 10 percent shorter than that. </p><p>Compared with their counterparts, chocolate Labs were also two times more likely to have ear inflammation and four times more likely to have a skin condition called hot spot.</p><p>The findings came as a surprise, said lead study author Paul McGreevy, a professor at the University of Sydney, in Australia.</p><p>\"The relationships between coat color and disease may reflect an inadvertent consequence of breeding certain pigmentations,\" McGreevy said in a university news release.</p><p>\"Because chocolate color is recessive in dogs, the gene for this color must be present in both parents for their puppies to be chocolate. Breeders targeting this color may therefore be more likely to breed only Labradors carrying the chocolate coat gene,\" he explained.</p><p>\"It may be that the resulting reduced gene pool includes a higher proportion of genes conducive to ear and skin conditions,\" McGreevy added.</p><p>Among all Labs in the study, the most common health problems were obesity, ear infections and joint conditions.</p><p>Nearly 9 percent of the Labradors in the study were overweight or obese, one of the highest percentages among dog breeds.

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Oct. 25, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The wave of marijuana legalization that's swept across the United States in recent years has been fueled in part by the popular belief that pot is essentially harmless.</p><p>But a new study shows that some heavy users will experience withdrawal symptoms while coming down from their high.</p><p>About 1 in 10 frequent cannabis users reports symptoms like anxiety, hostility, insomnia and depression after the intoxicating effects of weed start to wear off, said senior researcher Deborah Hasin, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.</p><p>These folks might be using pot to help treat their anxiety or depression, unaware that they're putting the cart before the horse, Hasin said.</p><p>\"There's a lot of overlap between the symptoms of cannabis withdrawal and the symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorders,\" Hasin said. \"People may actually mistakenly feel that cannabis is helping a depression or an anxiety disorder, when what's happening in reality is they're perpetuating a withdrawal syndrome. Using cannabis makes the symptoms go away, but it's not a good solution to it.\"</p><p>Advocates of marijuana legalization acknowledge that pot can cause withdrawal symptoms, but point out that its addictive potential is far less than other products that have been legally available to consumers for decades.</p><p>\"The fact that these withdrawal symptoms are relatively mild and short-lived is one of the reasons why cannabis possesses a far lower dependence liability than most other controlled substances, including alcohol and tobacco,\" said Paul Armentano, deputy director of NORML, a group advocating for reform of marijuana laws.</p><p>\"For instance, the profound physical withdrawal effects associated with tobacco are so severe that many subjects who strongly desire to quit end up reinitiating their use,\" Armentano explained. </p><p>\"In the case of alcohol, the abrupt ceasing of use in heavy users can be so severe that it can lead to death. Simply withdrawing from caffeine can lead to a number of adverse side effects, like rebound headaches,\" he said.</p><p>At this point, 30 states have laws that legalize marijuana in some form. Nine states and Washington, D.C., have made pot legal for recreational use, while the rest allow for use of medical marijuana.</p><p>To test the notion that pot is harmless, Hasin and her colleagues analyzed data gathered by a 2012-2013 federal survey on health problems caused by alcohol and other substance use. During the survey, federal researchers conducted face-to-face interviews with more than 36,000 participants across the United States.</p><p>The new study focused specifically on responses from more than 1,500 survey participants who reported using pot three or more times a week during the previous year, Hasin said. They were considered frequent or heavy marijuana users.</p><p>About 12 percent of heavy pot users reported symptoms that align with those of cannabis withdrawal syndrome, a condition outlined in DSM-5, a diagnostic manual produced by the American Psychiatric Association.</p><p>These included nervousness or anxiety (76 percent), hostility (72 percent), sleep difficulty (68 percent) and depressed mood (59 percent), researchers reported.</p><p>Physical symptoms were reported less frequently, but heavy users were more likely to experience headaches, shakiness or tremors, and sweating, the study found.</p><p>People with a history of mood or personality disorders had a greater risk for experiencing withdrawal symptoms, Hasin said.</p><p>Frequency of use within a week was not significantly associated with withdrawal symptoms, but the number of joints smoked per day did make a difference, researchers found.</p><p>Smoking six or more joints per day was associated with cannabis withdrawal syndrome, while smoking five or fewer joints per day was not.</p><p>\"If people are using cannabis frequently and they're experiencing these symptoms, they should really consider cutting down on their use, at least to see what happens,\" Hasin said.</p><p>\"While many people can use cannabis without harm, there are some people who have adverse consequences from using it,\" she continued. \"If they're frequent users and they're experiencing some of these symptoms, they should consider the possibility that cannabis may be causing rather than helping them with those symptoms.\"</p><p>Emily Feinstein, executive vice president for the Center on Addiction, praised the study for shedding new light on the relative safety of marijuana use.</p><p>\"Misinformation and misunderstanding about marijuana is rampant,\" Feinstein said. \"Marijuana is addictive, and people who are dependent on the drug exhibit the same symptoms as those with other addictions, including cravings and withdrawal.\" She was not involved with the study.</p><p>\"When teens and young adults use marijuana, they are nearly twice as likely to become addicted as adults. In the debate about legalizing recreational marijuana, we can't lose sight of that,\" Feinstein continued. \"We need to take the public health risks associated with expanded use of the drug seriously.\"</p><p>The new study was published recently in the journal <i>Drug and Alcohol Dependence</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse has more about <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/marijuana-addictive\" target=\"_new\">marijuana and addiction</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 3, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Doctors are not doing nearly enough to help peripheral artery disease patients quit smoking, a key risk factor for the disease, a new study shows.</p> <p>The study, published Oct. 3 in the <i>Journal of the American Heart Association</i>, took a close look at the relationship between smoking and peripheral artery disease, or PAD, a narrowing of the peripheral arteries serving the legs, arms, head and stomach. More than 202 million people are affected by PAD worldwide, and many of them smoke: More than one-third of PAD patients in the study were active smokers.</p> <p>\"Smoking is the single most important modifiable risk factor for peripheral artery disease. It is associated with faster progression of the disease, greater risk of complications such as limb amputations, heart attacks and death, and also poor response to treatment,\" said the study's lead author, Dr. Krishna Patel, a cardiology fellow at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute.</p> <p>\"Smoking cessation is the cornerstone for managing patients with PAD. It could halt the disease progression and improve and reverse some of these risks,\" she said.</p> <p>Researchers studied 1,275 patients at vascular specialty clinics in the United States, Australia and the Netherlands who were in advanced stages of PAD with blockages in limb arteries. The year-long study found that few doctors emphasized smoking cessation or gave patients adequate resources to help them quit, Patel said.</p> <p>\"Less than one in five smokers received a referral to a smoking cessation counseling program from their doctors, and only one in 10 received medicines or nicotine replacement therapy to help them quit,\" she said. \"Perhaps as a result, these patients either continue smoking or have a very high rate of relapse if they make an attempt to quit.\"</p> <p>Patel said one-third of smokers in the study who tried to quit relapsed within a year. \"Doctors taking care of these patients need to be aware of this and should treat smoking as any other chronic addiction problem and provide consistent, repeated and continuous smoking cessation support,\" she said.</p> <p>Dr. Aruna Pradhan, a cardiologist and epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, called the study \"a call to action to the vascular community.\"</p> <p>\"This is a unique, well-conducted study that provides a clear message to providers that we're not doing enough about this issue,\" said Pradhan, who was not involved in the research.</p> <p>Pradhan said there were several reasons why she and other cardiologists might not have done enough to help PAD patients quit smoking, including a lack of time and not being aware of how effective smoking cessation therapies can be.</p> <p>\"We're guilty of not going out of our comfort zone into areas like nutrition and smoking cessation and lifestyle behavioral modifications,\" she said. \"We're often so focused on pharmacotherapies for things we know we can treat &ndash; things like LDL cholesterol and blood pressure.\"</p> <p>She said she'd like to see studies on the best ways to get cardiologists to include smoking cessation in PAD treatment, especially because more and more health insurance plans now cover smoking cessation.</p> <p>Whatever the answer is, the study offers a clear message that cardiologists need to increase their time and effort in this area, Pradhan said.</p> <p>\"Smoking cessation is an intervention that can prevent progression of this disease. We really need to get on board,\" she said.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 3, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Decades-old allegations of sexual assault have consumed the nation for the past two weeks, as the Senate, the FBI and the public wrestle with what it all may mean for both the U.S. Supreme Court and American society at large in the age of &#35;MeToo.</p><p>The high-stakes debate is still unfolding. But now comes a new study that warns that sexual assault and harassment often take a significant long-term toll on a victim's mental and physical health, increasing the risk not only for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but also high blood pressure and sleep loss.</p><p>\"The long-term health effects related to sexual harassment and assault is not just about the impact that it has on a person's mental health,\" said study author Karestan Koenen. \"This study is evidence that this kind of trauma has a real and measurable physical impact, which needs to be considered.\"</p>  <p>Koenen is a professor of psychiatric epidemiology with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.</p><p>She and her colleagues reported their findings online Oct. 3 in <i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i>. The findings are also scheduled for presentation this week at a meeting of the North American Menopause Society, in San Diego.</p><p>For the study, researchers focused on just over 300 women between 40 and 60 years old, with an average age of 54. All were residents of Pittsburgh and were part of a broader study examining the link between menopausal hot flashes and atherosclerosis, commonly known as hardening of the arteries. Roughly three-quarters of the women were white.</p><p>All completed a full physical assessment, and a trauma interview and questionnaire.</p><p>Nearly one in five (19 percent) said they'd experienced verbal or physical sexual harassment in the workplace. Just over one in five (22 percent) said they'd been sexually assaulted. About 10 percent said they had been the victim of both.</p><p>Women who had been sexually harassed tended to be college-educated, though they were also more likely to struggle financially.</p><p>The study found that sexual harassment was linked to significantly higher blood pressure -- and a 20 percent increase in heart disease risk -- among those not already taking blood pressure drugs. Higher blood fat levels also were observed, as was poor sleep quality that equated to a doubling of insomnia risk.</p><p>Sexual assault victims saw their risk for major depression symptoms triple and their anxiety risk double. Their risk for poor sleep quality and insomnia doubled, the study authors reported.</p><p>The study only uncovered an association between sexual assault and subsequent health troubles, however, not a cause-and-effect connection.</p><p>Koenen said the findings indicate \"that sexual assault and harassment may need to be screened as significant health risk factors by primary care physicians, the way physicians often screen patients for depression or smoking.\"</p><p>That suggestion was seconded by Dean Kilpatrick, a distinguished university professor of clinical psychology at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston.</p><p>\"Not everyone will experience persistent and long-term effects following assault or harassment. Some people are helped by being surrounded by a lot of good social support,\" he said. </p><p>\"But many people are not,\" Kilpatrick added. \"In fact, many women don't talk about their experience with anybody, sometimes for decades, often for fear of not being believed or of being called either a 'nut' or a 'slut.' So they carry around a secret, which sort of eats away at them, and precludes them from getting the help they need. And these are very, very stressful experiences, both physically and psychologically. So the risk for long-term mental and physical health problems is very real and should not be trivialized.\"</p><p>Kilpatrick said that, without reaching out and getting needed help, victims often find that the notion that \"things get better with time\" is not borne out.</p><p>Why? \"There's some evidence that when you have these sorts of very extreme and scary experiences happen early in life that it can really dis-regulate the stress response system, meaning the normal impetus to 'fight, flight or freeze.' And we've known that about 60 percent of all sexual assaults and rapes or attempted rapes happen before the age of 18.\"</p><p>And, he added, \"that can lead to a build-up of years of chronic stress&hellip; And we're not built to stay under chronic stress for a long time. So in the end, it's that stress that may end up accounting for the higher blood pressure and other things this investigation found.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on sexual assault at the <a href=\"https://www.womenshealth.gov/relationships-and-safety/sexual-assault-and-rape/sexual-assault/\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a>.</p>",

He is associate director of the Center for Integrative Pain Neuroimaging at Harvard Medical School.</p> <p>The new research used an advanced imaging test called positron emission tomography (PET) and looked at 31 people with fibromyalgia and 27 healthy \"controls\" from Boston and Stockholm, Sweden.</p><p>Dr. Harry Gewanter, a master of the American College of Rheumatology, agreed the findings could bring comfort to patients.</p><p>\"There's a heck of a lot of stigma associated with chronic pain conditions like fibromyalgia. I think it's going to make a lot of people feel much better to know that there are physiologic changes you can find,\" Gewanter said.</p><p>Fibromyalgia causes pain throughout the body, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The condition also causes sleep problems, fatigue and difficulty with thinking and memory.</p> <p>The disorder affects about 4 million Americans, the CDC reports. The exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, though the researchers said it's likely a disease of the central nervous system. Medications and lifestyle modifications can help manage the condition.</p><p>All of the volunteers in the study underwent PET scans. Fibromyalgia patients in Boston were heavier than the healthy controls in Boston, and those in Stockholm with fibromyalgia.  The researchers said this was the only significantly different variable between the two groups.</p><p>When the researchers compared the scans of people with fibromyalgia to healthy controls, they saw more inflammation in the immune cells of the brain (glia) in people with fibromyalgia.</p><p>Loggia said the findings might lead to better ways to test fibromyalgia treatments, to see if they reduce inflammation.  It's also possible that this finding may eventually help researchers tease out the cause of the disorder.</p> <p>Gewanter said this study gives scientists a number of possible directions to go. One is to be able to follow a treatment to see how well it works. Another is possibly developing ways to intervene with new treatments.</p><p>Now, treatment focuses on medication and lifestyle changes. According to the CDC, people with fibromyalgia are encouraged to try to exercise 30 minutes daily most days of the week. And establishing regular sleep habits can help, as can reducing stress as much as possible, perhaps using yoga or meditation.</p><p>The study was published recently in the journal <i>Brain, Behavior, and Immunity</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about fibromyalgia from the <a href=\"https://www.rheumatology.org/I-Am-A/Patient-Caregiver/Diseases-Conditions/Fibromyalgia\" target=\"_new\">American College of Rheumatology</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 6, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Despite three decades of declines in secondhand smoke exposure, 58 million Americans -- children included -- are still breathing in tobacco fumes, federal health officials reported Thursday.</p><p>Nearly 40 percent of children aged 3 to 11 are exposed to secondhand smoke, as are nearly 50 percent of the poor and almost 40 percent of people living in apartments, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>\"The good news is that secondhand smoke is down since we started measuring it in the late 1980s,\" said Brian King, deputy director for research translation in the CDC's Office on Smoking and Health. </p><p>Nearly 90 percent of Americans were exposed to secondhand smoke in 1988, but that number dropped to 25 percent in 2014, he said. </p><p>\"The bad news is that we still have marked disparities across population groups, and we haven't seen any change since 2011,\" King added. </p><p>The dangers of secondhand smoke are well-known. Secondhand smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals, including some 70 that can cause cancer, the CDC team said in background notes. </p><p>Secondhand smoke can also cause sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, ear infections, asthma attacks in infants and children, as well as heart disease, stroke and lung cancer, the researchers pointed out.</p><p>Each year, exposure to secondhand smoke causes more than 41,000 deaths from lung cancer and heart disease among nonsmoking adults and 400 cases of SIDS, according to the 2014 U.S. Surgeon General's Report. </p><p>In the new study, the researchers used readings of cotinine levels, a marker of secondhand smoke found in the blood, from the 2011 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.</p><p>They found that the number of people exposed to secondhand smoke did not decline among most groups. That could be because many states have still not enacted laws that forbid smoking in workplaces, restaurants or bars at the state and local levels, the researchers said.</p><p>Only 27 states and the District of Columbia have such laws. Since 2014, however, some laws have been enacted in local areas that might eventually trigger more reductions in exposure to secondhand smoke.</p><p>From 2015 to 2017, nearly 200 communities adopted comprehensive smoke-free laws and another 21 have implemented these laws since July 2018, according to the report. </p><p>Children's exposure to secondhand smoke usually happens in homes when parents smoke. Exposure also occurs in apartment buildings and public housing where smokers live. Exposure should decline in public housing, however, as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development adopted a rule requiring public housing to be smoke-free after July 31, 2018.</p><p>Since laws banning smoking in public places have been enacted, \"private places like homes and vehicles are the last bastion of places where people can smoke cigarettes,\" King said. </p><p>According to the report: </p><ul><li>Among blacks who don't smoke, half are exposed to secondhand smoke, including 2 out of 3 children.</li><li>Among people who don't smoke and didn't graduate from high school, 3 of 10 are exposed to secondhand smoke.</li><li>Among people living in a home with a smoker, 7 of 10 are exposed to secondhand smoke.</li></ul><p>The report will be published Dec. 7 in the CDC's <i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</i>.</p><p>Although fewer adults are smoking cigarettes than ever before, too many Americans are still exposed to secondhand smoke, said Thomas Carr, director of national policy at the American Lung Association.</p><p>\"Exposure continues to be prevalent in certain populations, and we need more smoke-free laws,\" he said.</p><p>Proven ways to reduce exposure to secondhand smoke include laws that prohibit smoking in workplaces and public places, along with smoke-free home and car rules. Educational programs warning people about the risks of secondhand smoke are effective, the CDC researchers said. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/secondhand_smoke/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">secondhand smoke</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Jan. 4, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- The  flu is now spreading throughout the United States, health officials said Friday.</p><p>Since last week, when nine states and New York City were reporting high flu activity, 19 states and New York City are now seeing a lot of flu, and it's widespread in 24 states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p> <p>\"The season is really starting to pick up,\" said Lynnette Brammer, the lead of CDC's domestic influenza surveillance team.</p><p>The most common type of flu around is the influenza A strain H1N1. That strain has been circulating and was pandemic in 2009 and in 1918. </p><p>In 1918, H1N1 flu killed 50 million people  around the world. But the current vaccine works exceedingly well against H1N1 -- it is up to  65 percent effective, which is highly effective for a flu vaccine, according to the CDC.</p><p>\"H1N1 is the most common [strain] in most of the country,\" Brammer said. \"But it's odd that in the Southeast, the H3N2 virus is more common.\"</p><p>The influenza A H3N2 strain is the one that made last year's flu season so severe. When that strain predominated, nearly 1 million Americans were hospitalized and 80,000 died.</p><p>According to the CDC, flu activity is high in Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Virginia.</p><p>It's too early to tell how severe this season will be or what the mix of viruses will be, Brammer said. Right now, the hospitalization rate is still relatively low compared with last year, and deaths are still below epidemic levels, she said.  </p><p>\"But as we see a jump in activity as we did this week, we would expect an increase in hospitalizations, and unfortunately, probably an increase in mortality,\" Brammer said.</p><p>The CDC doesn't track adult deaths from flu, but they do keep tabs on pediatric deaths. This week two more children have died from flu, bringing the total to 13.</p><p>\"There's still a lot more flu season to come,\" she said.  \"I expect activity to continue for several more weeks.\"</p><p>The best way to protect yourself and those around you is to get a flu shot, and there's still plenty of time to get vaccinated, Brammer said.</p><p>\"Anybody who hasn't been vaccinated should go and get vaccinated,\" she said. This year's vaccine is well matched to the circulating strains of flu and a lot of vaccine is available, Brammer added.</p> <p>The CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get vaccinated. Getting your kids their flu shot is the best way to protect them and prevent deaths from the complications of flu, she said.</p><p>Getting a flu shot should be at the top of the list for those at high risk for flu, including the elderly and people with heart disease or lung disease and pregnant women.</p><p>Getting vaccinated won't guarantee that you won't come down with flu, but if you do, your illness will be milder, health experts say.</p><p>If you get the flu, antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu and Relenza can make your illness less severe. But if you're sick, the CDC recommends that you stay home so you won't infect others.</p> <p>Brammer can't predict when the flu season will peak, but it most likely won't be until the end of February or March. So there's still a long way to go, she said. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on the flu, visit the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.htm/\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

The feel-good effects also appeared to linger into the following day.</p><p>\"This finding is consistent with multiple emerging lines of evidence demonstrating the ability of touch behaviors within close relationships to reduce perceptions of threat and increase feelings of security and well-being,\" said study author Michael Murphy. He's a postdoctoral research associate in psychology at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.</p><p>\"While this research is still in its preliminary stages, our study suggests that consensual hugs might be a simple yet effective way to provide support to both women and men enduring relationship conflict,\" Murphy added.</p><p>While most prior research has focused on the role of touch in romantic relationships, Murphy and his team concentrated on consensual -- not sexual -- hugging. More than 400 women and men were interviewed each night for 14 consecutive days about their conflicts, hugs received, and positive and negative feelings.</p><p>The researchers found no difference in the stress-reducing effects of hugs in women and men. Also, no difference was noted between those who were married or in a committed relationship and those who were not.</p> <p>But several important questions remain, Murphy said, including whether a hug's timing matters in relation to conflicts.</p> <p>\"Does who provides the hug matter? Does it matter if hugs are offered in direct response to conflict or independent of conflict?\" he asked, noting that he's undertaking new research to examine that.</p><p>A 2015 Carnegie Mellon study found that those who were hugged more had a lower risk of catching colds after being exposed to the virus, Murphy noted.</p><p>And other physically beneficial effects of hugs have been documented, said Harris Stratyner, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City.</p><p>Hugging can increase natural levels of oxytocin, a feel-good chemical that helps mothers and babies bond, said Stratyner, who wasn't involved with the study.</p><p>It's amazing to see what hugs can do, so I wasn't surprised by the study's findings in the least,\" said Stratyner. \"We have always known that hugs can soothe. A hug transcends anger and anguish and loss.</p><p>\"Hugs are transformational,\" he added, \"and like music, they're universal.\"</p><p>Murphy and Stratyner agreed that people can likely tell the difference between a heartfelt hug and a more perfunctory one.</p><p>\"They have to have the quality of genuineness,\" Stratyner noted. \"It can't be a hug that's a standoffish kind of thing.\"</p><p>The study was published Oct. 3 in the journal <i>PLOS ONE</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Oregon Health and Science University offers <a href=\"https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/faculty/mentoring/mentoring-best-practices/challenges/resolving-conflict.cfm\" target=\"_new\">tips on resolving conflict</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Oct. 2, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Americans' love affair with fast food continues, with 1 in every 3 adults chowing down on the fare on any given day.</p><p>That's the finding from a new report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When asked by researchers, 37 percent of adults said they'd eaten fast food at least once over the past 24 hours.</p><p>There was one surprise: Bucking the notion that poorer Americans favor fast food the most, the report found that intake actually rose with income.</p><p>For example, while about 32 percent of lower-income folks ate fast food daily, more than 36 percent of middle-income consumers had fast food on a given day, as did 42 percent of those with higher incomes, the report found.</p><p>Whatever your income bracket, fast food probably isn't doing your health any favors. That's because it \"has been associated with increased intake of calories, fat and sodium,\" the CDC team said.</p><p>All that adds up to widening waistlines and hardening arteries, one nutritionist warned.</p><p>\"Most fast food is not good for our bodies,\" said Liz Weinandy, a registered dietitian at Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center. </p><p>\"The more of it we eat, the more likely we are to be overweight or obese and have increased risk for several diseases like type 2 diabetes, heart disease and metabolic syndrome when talking to patients,\" she said.</p><p>Too often, though, Americans ignore the danger.</p><p>\"When we see news clips of a shark swimming near a beach, it scares us into not going near that beach,\" Weinandy said. But \"what we <i>should</i> be scared of is double cheeseburgers, french fries and large amounts of sugary beverages.\"</p><p>The new report was led by Cheryl Fryar of the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. Her team tracked data from in-person government surveys conducted with thousands of U.S. adults between 2013 and 2016. People were asked to recall what they'd eaten in the past 24 hours.</p><p>The report found that Americans tend to taper off fast foods as they age.

But this study is the first to show that it can easily spread between the nose and the hands.</p><p>The health implications are nothing to sniff at, the research team said.</p><p>\"Pneumococcal infection is a major cause of death around the world, and it is estimated that it is responsible for 1.3 million deaths in children under 5 years [of age] annually,\" said lead researcher  Victoria Connor.  She's a clinical research fellow at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in England.</p><p> \"The elderly and people with other causes of impaired immunity, such as chronic illness, are also at an increased risk of pneumococcal infections,\" she added.</p><p>Connor called the current understanding of how pneumonia is transmitted \"poor, so we wanted to look at how it may be spread in the community.\"</p><p>In the study, the hands of the 40 healthy adults were contaminated with pneumococcus bacteria.  Participants were divided into four groups. The \"wet sniff\" group sniffed their hands, which had been contaminated with water laden with pneumococcus bacteria. The \"dry sniff\" group did the same, but this time the bacteria were applied dry, to the back of the hand. A third group, called \"wet poke,\" picked or poked their nose with a finger that had been contaminated with bacteria-laden water, while the \"dry poke\" group did the same, but with fingers tainted with air-dried bacteria samples.</p><p>The result: while pneumococcus was readily passed on in all of the test groups, hand-to-nose spread of the germ was highest among the \"wet sniff\" and \"wet poke\" groups, probably because bacteria die off more in dryer environments, the team said.</p><p>The findings were reported Oct. 10 in the <i>European Respiratory Journal</i>.</p><p>The study suggests that good hand hygiene, as well as keeping kids' toys clean, could help protect youngsters from catching and spreading the bacteria to other children. It could also cut down on spread to a child's elderly relatives, who may be more susceptible to infection, the researchers noted.</p><p>Of course, Connor acknowledged that \"it might not be realistic to get children to stop picking, poking and rubbing their noses.\"</p><p>There might even be one positive side to nose-picking. \"[The] presence of the bacteria can sometimes boost the immune system of children and can reduce their chances of carrying it again later in life,\" Connor noted in a journal news release.</p><p>But spreading these germs can cause real harm to others, she stressed.</p><p>So, restraining kids from picking their noses \"may be important when children are in contact with elderly relatives or relatives with reduced immune systems,\" Connor suggested.</p> <p>\"In these situations, ensuring good hand hygiene and cleaning of toys or surfaces would likely reduce transmission, and reduce the risk of developing pneumococcal infection such as pneumonia,\" she said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians has more on <a href=\"https://familydoctor.org/condition/pneumonia/?adfree=true\" target=\"_new\">pneumonia</a>.</p>",

The death rate associated with this cancer tends to be high because it is routinely diagnosed at a late stage. </p><p>\"This important work could explain why there is an increase in the oral cancers among World Trade Center-exposed workers, who had a massive exposure to fine particulate matter,\" said Moline, who was not involved with the new study. </p><p>\"Further research like this is critical to understanding the implications of air pollution, whether from industrial facilities, or the aftermath of a disaster such as the World Trade Center attacks,\" she added.</p><p>Fine-particle pollution -- the main cause of haze -- stems from chemicals emitted by power plants, industries and automobiles, as well as smoke from fires, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p>For this study, researchers compared the health records of more than 482,000 men 40 and older with pollution data gathered from 66 air quality monitoring stations across Taiwan. </p><p>Smoking and frequent betel quid chewing were associated with increased risk, but so too were heavy levels of particulate pollution.</p><p>Because the particles in pollution are so tiny, the heavy metals contained within them might be easily absorbed by the tissues of the mouth, researchers said. Their size might also allow them to wreak greater havoc on the body.</p><p>Liaw said people concerned about mouth cancer should pay attention to air quality reports and avoid prolonged outdoor activities when particulate pollution levels are too high. They also might consider wearing a face mask when outdoors to reduce the amount of air pollutants they inhale.</p><p>\"Because it is hard to completely avoid exposure to air pollution, modification of lifestyles associated with oral cancer is encouraged,\" Liaw said. For instance, not smoking, not chewing betel quid and avoiding exposure to air pollutants may help prevent the malignancy, he said.</p><p>Liaw also recommended mouth-cancer screening for people living in smoggy areas, \"to avoid late diagnosis and subsequent mortality.\"</p><p>The findings were published Oct. 9 in the <i>BMJ</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Oral Cancer Foundation has more about <a href=\"https://oralcancerfoundation.org/facts/\" target=\"_new\">mouth cancer</a>.</p>",

But Yale University researchers found many hospitals make the process too confusing or expensive.</p><p>\"There were overwhelming inconsistencies in information relayed to patients regarding the personal health information they are allowed to request, as well as the formats and costs of release, both within institutions and across institutions,\" said Carolyn Lye, the study's first author.</p><p>\"We also found considerable noncompliance with state and federal regulations and recommendations with respect to the costs and processing times,\" Lye, a medical student, said in a university news release.</p><p>She and her colleagues evaluated the medical records departments at 83 top-ranked hospitals in 29 states.</p><p>On their record request forms, only 53 percent of the hospitals gave patients an option to access their full medical record. But when asked over the telephone, all 83 hospitals said they could release full medical records to patients.</p><p>There were also discrepancies between request forms and phone information about formats in which medical records could be released (electronic, paper or in person).</p><p>The researchers also found that 58 percent of the hospitals charged more than the federally recommended $6.50 for medical records stored electronically. One hospital charged $541.50 for a 200-page record.</p><p>The study was published online Oct. 5 in <i>JAMA Network Open</i>.</p><p>Stricter enforcement of the patients' right of access is necessary to ensure that the request process across hospitals is easy to navigate, timely and affordable, Lye suggested.</p><p>\"We are also in an era in which patients are participants in their own health care,\" she added. \"Inhibiting access for patients to their own medical records with complicated, lengthy and costly request processes prevents patients from obtaining information that they may need to better understand their medical conditions and communicate with their physicians.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>HealthIT.gov has more on <a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/faq/how-can-i-access-my-health-informationmedical-record\" target=\"_new\">accessing your medical records</a>.</p>",

Now use these tips to make the most of these workouts.</p><p>If you're using a machine, like a treadmill or stationary bike, check that you're maintaining proper form. Just as coasting when riding a bike outdoors doesn't provide a workout, resting your upper body on the handles of a machine or slumping on its console means you aren't working as well as you could be. If you're having a hard time staying upright, you may have set the machine at too fast or challenging a setting.</p><p>Speaking of machines, resist making one machine in particular your only type of cardio workout. You'll expand your horizons and get some fresh air by running or walking outdoors or taking a swim when weather permits. You might find that being outside makes the workout more interesting and invigorating.</p><p>When working out at a gym, add a fun element by creating a cardio fitness circuit, especially if you find yourself getting bored after the first 10 minutes on a machine. Break up your workout into a mini triathlon: 10 minutes on the treadmill, 10 on the bike and 10 in the pool doing laps or water exercises.</p><p>Remember that cardio doesn't always have to feel like hard work. Spend a fun evening going dancing with friends or your significant other. It may not seem like it, but if you break into a sweat, you're getting your heart rate up.</p><p>Finally, make a plan to regularly try a new form of cardio, not just to stave off boredom, but also to challenge different muscles and add to your overall fitness level.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Council on Exercise has tips to help you make the most of <a href=\"https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/lifestyle/blog/3701/4-cardio-training-mistakes-to-avoid\" target=\"_new\">cardio workouts</a>.</p>",

If you plan to do a race, go for a run or run/walk ahead of time to assess your fitness level.</li><li>Slowly ease into new activities. Cross-train to vary the stresses on your joints. Stretch after an activity and do recovery workouts to reduce soreness. Dress appropriately for the weather. If you've previously had an injury, do preventive exercises before an activity.</li><li>Instead of touch football or a holiday 5K over the holidays, consider low-impact strength-training activities such as a walk or bike ride, yoga and Pilates.</li></ul><p>Another option is to look for a holiday deal at a local gym, rather than waiting after New Year's Day to begin a fitness program, Shybut suggested.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/features/healthytips/index.html\" target=\"_new\">holiday health tips</a>.</p>",

Wear several layers of clothing to trap warm air between the layers.</li><li>Let others know when you're planning to spend time outside and have a fully charged cellphone with you.</li><li>Keep your home warm. Set the thermostat to at least 68 degrees Fahrenheit.

Between 2012 and 2017, the patients had visited one of 57 federally qualified health centers that provide health care to underserved communities in 19 states.</p><p>Of the 875 people with diagnosed opioid addiction, only 36 percent were tested for hepatitis C. Of those, 11 percent had been exposed to hepatitis C and almost 7 percent had evidence of chronic hepatitis C infection, the researchers found.</p><p>Overall, 2.5 percent, or more than 6,800 teens and young adults who visited the health centers, were tested for hepatitis C. Of those, 122 tested positive for it. Those most likely to be tested were black, had any substance use disorder, and were ages 19 to 21.</p><p>The study was presented Thursday at IDWeek, a meeting of infectious disease specialists, in San Francisco.</p><p>Injection drug users who share needles often spread hepatitis C. It's possible that doctors don't test suspected opioid abusers because the drugs are available in pill form, which doesn't increase the risk of hepatitis C. However, studies show many youths who misuse prescription opioid pills eventually begin injecting drugs, the researchers noted.</p><p>Current guidelines only recommend hepatitis C testing for known injection drug users.</p><p>\"The issue is complicated by the fact that not enough at-risk youth are screened for opioid or other drug use for a variety of reasons, including lack of time, comfort level between clinician and patient, and privacy and stigma concerns,\" Epstein said in a meeting news release.</p><p>\"And even when drug use is identified, there's a belief that youth are less likely to test positive for hepatitis C, which isn't necessarily the case as we show in our study. Clearly, this is an overlooked group that is at high risk,\" she concluded.</p><p>Research presented at meetings is usually considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians has more on <a href=\"https://familydoctor.org/condition/hepatitis-c/?adfree=true\" target=\"_new\">hepatitis C</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Oct. 5, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Every now and then you might not feel well enough to exercise and decide to skip a workout. But if you have a cold that could last a full week, you probably won't want to find yourself facing a fitness setback once you've recovered.</p><p>Here's how to stay in the game.</p><p>The general guideline is that you should be able to work out if your symptoms are from the neck up, like a stuffy nose from a cold, but not when you have the whole-body achiness of the flu. Easy or moderate exercise, such as walking rather than running, should be fine. Some experts say it could even be beneficial.</p><p>But you don't want to spread germs at the gym, so work out at home to avoid infecting others. And remember to cut back on the intensity and length of your usual workout as needed to avoid further taxing your body and risking injury.</p><p>If you're sick enough that you need to significantly scale back your usual workout, a call to your doctor's office is warranted -- beyond whether it's safe to exercise with your particular illness, ask whether you need an office visit. Even if you get the go-ahead to exercise, tread lightly so you can see how your body responds. Stop if necessary -- pay attention to any clues that you just can't handle the physical exertion you're attempting.</p><p>If you have the full gamut of flu symptoms, like fever, fatigue and body aches, even moderate exercise is out. You might need to wait 2 to 4 weeks after recovery before you get back to high-level workouts. Return at a slow pace and gradually build up to avoid stressing your system.</p><p>What about exercise when you have a chronic condition?</p><p>Health experts say exercise may help you better manage it, especially if the illness is characterized by inflammation, such as an inflammatory bowel or rheumatic disease, because exercise engenders an <i>anti-</i>inflammatory response in the body. But you may need to sit out a severe flare, such as a rheumatoid arthritis attack.</p><p>And always follow your doctor's advice if you need to take any medications that make it unsafe to exercise.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Mayo Clinic has more on how to tell if you're <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/exercise/faq-20058494\" target=\"_new\">too sick to exercise</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Oct. 11, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The hormone prolactin -- most commonly associated with breastfeeding -- may play a role in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes, a new study suggests. </p><p>Researchers found that women with the highest levels of the hormone, though still in the normal range, had a 27 percent reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those with the lowest levels in the normal range. </p><p>\"Prolactin is a multi-function hormone -- it is not only related to pregnancy and breastfeeding, it also plays an important role in many other biological functions, like metabolism, immune regulation and water balance,\" said study lead author Jun Li. She is a post-doctoral research fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. </p><p>Li said previous studies have shown that prolactin may affect insulin secretion and sensitivity. Insulin carries sugar from the bloodstream into the body's cells to be used as fuel. People with type 2 diabetes don't use insulin efficiently, and as a result, their blood sugar levels rise too high. </p><p>Although the study linked higher (but still normal) levels of prolactin to a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes, Li said it's not yet clear if there are any practical implications from these findings. </p><p>\"It's too early to tell if altering prolactin concentrations is a suitable way for diabetes prevention,\" she said, adding that normally high prolactin levels are associated with a higher breast cancer risk. Plus, higher-than-normal levels can promote weight gain and increase insulin resistance, along with other adverse effects. </p><p>\"Future studies are needed to find out the mechanism and come up with practical strategies,\" Li said. </p><p>Diabetes expert Dr. Joel Zonszein said much about prolactin is unknown. \"It's a hormone made by the pituitary gland, and in women it goes up during lactation. But, we don't really know what it does in men.\" </p><p>What doctors do know is that prolactin levels normally vary a lot, he said. Zonszein is director of the clinical diabetes center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City.</p><p>Zonszein also noted that a diabetes medication called Cycloset (bromocriptine mesylate) lowers prolactin levels at the same time it lowers blood sugar levels -- an effect that would seem to contradict the new findings. </p><p>The study included more than 8,600 healthy American women whose health was tracked over time as part of a national study. Most were white and in their late 40s or 50s when the study began.</p><p>From that group, 699 women developed type 2 diabetes during an average follow-up period of 22 years.</p><p>The researchers adjusted the data to account for women's menopausal status and other diabetes risk factors.</p><p> The findings showed that the higher the women's prolactin levels (while still in the normal range), the less likely they were to develop type 2 diabetes.</p><p>But the study does not prove cause and effect.</p><p>The report was published Oct. 11 in the journal <i>Diabetologia</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/preventing-type-2-diabetes\" target=\"_new\"> preventing type 2 diabetes</a> from the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.</p>",

But what you top it with can turn it from diet delight to diet disaster.</p><p>Whether you're at home or facing a tempting all-you-can-eat salad bar at a restaurant, these tips will keep fat and calories in check.</p><p>Creamy dressings can have more than 130 calories per serving, nearly all of them fat -- and not the healthiest type of fat, either. Ranch, cheese and mayo-based dressings are all culprits. Instead, a drizzle of vinegar and a spray of olive oil will dress your lettuce with few calories.</p><p>Protein can turn salad into a meal, but stay away from fatty meats, bacon and fried chicken or shrimp. Try grilled salmon or chicken instead.</p><p>Cheese may be the worst of the salad bar mistakes -- mounds of shredded cheese add hundreds of calories. If you want some cheesy taste, sprinkle on a tablespoon of grated Parmesan. Even better, add a few chunks of fresh avocado for its healthy fats and creamy feel.</p><p>Croutons and crispy noodles add crunch, but little nutrition and lots of calories. A few nuts and seeds can provide the same type of crunch plus great nutrients. But use a spoon, not a ladle, to add them judiciously because they're relatively high in calories (due to healthful fats). Just make sure they're not sugar-glazed or overly salty.</p><p>Finally, if you're ordering a salad from a menu, watch out for the vessel it's served in. A bread or taco bowl, for instance, is just like eating extra servings of carbs and fat. Enjoy the contents, but not the shell.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Consumer Reports has a great guide for new ways to eat <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/fruits-vegetables/leafy-greens-new-ways-to-eat/\" target=\"_new\">leafy greens</a>.</p>",

He is associate director of the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.</p><p>\"We now live in a fast-paced, 'always-on' era that causes increased psycho-social stress and, possibly, an increase in the likelihood of sudden cardiac arrest,\" Chugh said in a Cedars-Sinai news release.</p><p>For the study, Chugh's team analyzed data on cardiac arrests in Oregon between 2004 and 2014. Of the 1,535 people who died from sudden cardiac arrest, only 14 percent died between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 a.m., and there was no evidence that more cardiac arrests occurred on Mondays.</p><p>Along with stress, other factors that may explain the findings include changes in how high-risk patients are being treated, and problems with how past studies have measured time of death caused by cardiac arrest, such as using time of death on a death certificate rather than the actual time of death due to cardiac arrest, the researchers added.</p><p>Cardiac arrest is different than a heart attack, which is typically caused by reduced blood flow to the heart due to clogged arteries. Cardiac arrest is caused by defective electrical activity of the heart. Patients may have little or no warning, and usually experience sudden death. Each year in the United States, there are about 300,000 deaths from sudden cardiac arrest.</p><p>\"Because sudden cardiac arrest is usually fatal, we have to prevent it before it strikes,\" Chugh said. \"This is just another piece to the puzzle.

Your day might start with a relaxing yoga class, then progress to a massage or body wrap and finish with a mani-pedi. If you're unclear about any offerings, be sure to call for further descriptions or simply to ask questions.</p><p>Before booking, mention any health considerations you have, such as allergies or skin conditions. Typically a spa will also want to know if you're pregnant. If you're having a massage, state whether you prefer a man or woman practitioner, and be sure to specify the type of massage you want since techniques can vary from extremely gentle to very deep.</p><p>Often, a spa will recommend that you eat only a light meal before your visit so that your digestive system isn't working overtime while you're trying to relax. You might want to skip or at least limit the amount of caffeine you drink in the hours before you go.</p><p>To make the day effortless and prolong the spa feeling, arrange to be dropped off and picked up if possible so that maneuvering through rush-hour traffic won't erase your newfound feeling of tranquility.</p><p>Arrive about a half-hour before your first service to check in, put on a robe, and maybe even sip an herbal tea. And later, feel free to linger after your treatments. Some spas offer meals or snacks at a juice bar. Or maybe just enjoy leafing through a magazine in the reading room, soaking in the peace and quiet before returning to the real world.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Need help with your search for a great day spa?

But there are some signs that suggest your young person needs more serious help than a care package from home.</p><p>Some problems are temporary, like anxiety and stress, which affect huge numbers of college students. Some lifelong conditions, like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, may first appear now.</p><p>It may be hard for parents to tell if their college student needs better coping skills, a stronger support network or treatment for a serious mental health issue. But reaching out at the first signs of trouble can enable your child to get help before he or she reaches a crisis point.</p><p>Untreated mental health issues can lead to substance abuse, other dangerous behaviors and even suicide -- the second leading cause of death among college students after accidents.</p><p>Being unable to study, attend class or sleep and eat well are red flags for many problems, including anxiety disorders, depression and substance abuse.</p><p>Some Signs of Drug and Alcohol Abuse:</p><ul><li>Not remembering actions and events.</li> <li>Relationship problems.</li> <li>Risky behaviors like driving drunk.</li> <li>Falling and other injuries.</li></ul><p>Some Signs of Anxiety Disorders:</p><ul><li>Frequent feelings of fear or panic.</li> <li>Recurring nightmares and other sleep problems.</li> <li>Difficulty concentrating.</li> <li>Obsessive thoughts.</li></ul><p>Some Signs of Depression:</p><ul><li>Deep sadness, anxiety and irritability.</li><li>Loss of interest in social activities and favorite pastimes.</li><li>Sleeping difficulties.</li><li>Loss of or increase in appetite.</li></ul> <p>If you notice troubling signs, talk to your child about accessing on-campus resources like a student counseling center or health service. If your child is reluctant to get college counseling but willing to seek help off-campus, you might start the search for a community mental health center, hospital outpatient clinic or private therapist experienced with the situation your child is facing.</p><p>Once your child agrees to talk to a counselor or doctor, the next step is for him or her to make the appointment and take an active role in treatment.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Jed Foundation has detailed information to help parents spot <a href=\"https://www.jedfoundation.org/depresion-and-anxiety-among-college-students/\" target=\"_new\">transition year difficulties</a> early on.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<!--Spanish ID: 738459 --><p>MONDAY, Oct. 8, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- If you're gluten-sensitive, watch out: One-third of the \"gluten-free\" foods sold in U.S. restaurants actually contain trace levels of the substance, new research suggests.</p><p>The finding will be of particular concern to the 1 percent of Americans with the autoimmune disorder known as celiac disease. For them, even a minuscule amount of gluten -- a protein in wheat and other grains -- can damage the intestinal lining.</p><p>\"As awareness of celiac disease and the gluten-free diet have increased in recent years, restaurants have sought to offer selections that are compatible with these restrictions,\" said study author Dr. Benjamin Lebwohl. \"But some establishments do a better job than others at preventing cross-contamination.\"</p><p>And some gluten-free foods were riskier than others. For example, more than half of all purportedly gluten-free pastas and pizzas had gluten, according to the study.</p><p>Why?</p><p>\"The fact that gluten was so often found in pizza suggests that sharing an oven with gluten-containing pizza is a prime setting for cross-contamination,\" explained Lebwohl, of Columbia University's Celiac Disease Center. \"Gluten-free pasta can be contaminated if prepared in a pot of water that was used to prepare gluten-containing pasta.\"</p><p>Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates packaged foods with gluten-free labeling, there's no federal oversight of gluten-free claims in restaurants, said Lebwohl. </p><p>For the study, more than 800 investigators set out to assess the true gluten content of dishes listed as gluten-free on menus. Armed with portable gluten sensors, they tested for gluten levels that met or exceeded 20 parts per million, the standard cutoff for any gluten-free claim.</p><p>Based on more than 5,600 gluten tests over 18 months, the investigators determined that 27 percent of gluten-free breakfast meals actually contained gluten. At dinner time, this figure hit 34 percent. The rise could reflect a steady increase in gluten contamination risk as the day unfolds, the researchers said.</p><p>The concerns extend beyond the celiac community alone.</p><p>\"There are also people who don't have celiac disease but have symptoms triggered by gluten,\" Lebwohl said. People with this problem -- non-celiac gluten sensitivity -- rely on gluten-free labeling and safe food preparation practices for prevention of uncomfortable symptoms, he noted. These can include constipation, bloating and nausea.</p><p>\"These results underscore the need for education in food preparation at restaurants, and the need for diners to inquire about these precautions,\" Lebwohl said.</p><p>Dietitian Lona Sandon agreed. Gluten contamination in restaurants has long \"been a concern for those with celiac disease,\" said Sandon, an associate professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. She was not involved with the study.</p><p>\"Restaurant kitchens are just not built to assure the prevention of gluten contamination,\" Sandon said. A chef may easily set a gluten-free bun down on a cutting board that just had a wheat bun on it while trying to get food out quickly to the customer. Then again, staff may just not know what has gluten in it and what doesn't, she added.</p><p>In the absence of federal enforcement at the restaurant level, it's up to the person handling the gluten-free product to keep it from becoming contaminated, Sandon said.</p><p>The study is scheduled for presentation Monday at a meeting of the American College of Gastroenterology, in Philadelphia. Research presented at meetings is usually considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on gluten-free foods and celiac disease at <a href=\"https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2016/05/going-gluten-free/\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a>.</p>",

He's a research associate at the University of Maryland School of Medicine's  department of orthopedics, in Baltimore.</p><p>Common injuries for which people claiming workers' compensation received opioids include crushes, strains and sprains, permanent disability and chronic joint pain, the researchers reported.</p><p>Because many workers use opioids for work-related injuries, and given the danger of addiction, O'Hara believes it's a big and possibly growing problem. Common opioids include OxyContin and Vicodin.</p><p>\"Since persistent opioid use does not correlate well with injury severity, consideration should be given to not initiating opioid use for non-severe injuries,\" he said.</p><p>The main concern shared by doctors is the use of opioids for non-acute pain, said senior researcher Dr. Gerard Slobogean, an assistant professor of orthopedics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. \"Physical therapy, other complementary and alternative therapies, as well as non-opioid medical therapies, should be considered for many injured workers,\" he said.</p><p>For the study, the researchers collected data on nearly 9,600 injured workers who filed workers' compensation claims in Maryland from 2008 to 2016. All patients were initially treated with opioids.</p><p>Other factors linked to persistent opioid use included being older and having a yearly income of more than $60,000, the researchers found.</p><p>Lindsey Vuolo is associate director for health law and policy at the Center on Addiction. \"The high rate of persistent opioid use among injured workers in this study is concerning because such use may signify misuse, a risk factor for opioid use disorder,\" she said. </p><p>The progression from misuse to use of illicit opioids, such as heroin and fentanyl, is a hallmark of America's opioid crisis, said Vuolo, who was not part of the study. In 2016, more than 11.5 million Americans reported misuse of prescription opioids, with more than 14,000 people dying from overdoses involving prescription opioids, the researchers noted.</p><p>What's more, opioids are often ineffective for long-term pain management, Vuolo said. Safer treatment options, such as non-opioid painkillers and physical therapy, should be tried first to manage chronic pain, she said. </p><p>Dr. Jianguo Cheng, director of the multidisciplinary pain medicine fellowship program at the Cleveland Clinic and president of the American Academy of Pain Medicine, agreed.</p><p>Doctors need to get out of the habit of prescribing opioids as the first option to treat pain, said Cheng, who was not involved with the study. </p><p>\"Minimize exposure and use in terms of dose and frequency,\" he recommended. \"However, for certain patients who have failed other treatments, opioids are still an option and can be effective. So patients should not be denied this treatment option.\"</p><p>The report was published online Oct. 26 in the journal <i>JAMA Network Open</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse</a> for more on opioids.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<!--Spanish ID: 739157 --><p>TUESDAY, Oct. 30, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Deciding to have weight-loss surgery is tough enough, but then you have to choose between several procedures -- each with different risks and potential weight loss.</p><p> So how do you decide which one is best for you?</p><p>New research that compares three types of weight-loss surgery in more than 46,000 patients may help. The three types of surgery included gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy and adjustable gastric banding (also known as lap band). </p><p>The study found that gastric bypass surgery boasted the greatest weight loss -- both short- and long-term. But that procedure also had the highest rates of complications in the month following surgery.</p><p>\"There are trade-offs. Bypass is more effective for weight loss, but has a greater risk of short-term complications. People need to consider, 'What do I value most?' Is safety your biggest concern?  Or, is it the magnitude of the weight loss?\" said study lead author Dr. David Arterburn. He's a senior researcher at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle.</p><p>Arterburn added that it's important to consider other weight-loss treatments, such as medication. </p><p>Nearly 25,000 people in the study had Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. This procedure involves making the stomach smaller and bypassing part of the small intestine, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). After this surgery, people get fuller on much less food, and the body doesn't absorb as many calories. </p><p>Almost 19,000 people in the study had sleeve gastrectomy, which involves taking out a portion of your stomach so that you get fuller faster.</p><p>Finally, more than 2,500 people had adjustable lap-band surgery. A surgeon places an inflatable band around the top of your stomach, leaving only a small pouch that can be filled with food. The rest of your stomach is filled with a balloon containing saline solution that is attached to the band, according to NIDDK. Arterburn said this procedure has fallen out of favor in recent years. </p><p>The study found that gastric bypass appeared to be most effective for weight loss:</p><ul><li>Gastric bypass surgery resulted in an average 31 percent loss of total body weight in the first year and 25 percent of total body weight after five years.</li><li>Sleeve gastrectomy led to a 25 percent loss in total body weight in the first year and 19 percent loss of total body weight after five years.</li><li>Adjustable gastric banding led to a 14 percent total weight loss after a year and 12 percent at five years.</li></ul><p>For the average person in this study, there was a 19-pound weight loss difference between the bypass and sleeve procedures after five years. The average person in this study weighed 277 pounds before surgery, the researchers said.</p><p>But the 30-day rate of serious complications for gastric bypass was nearly double the risk of the sleeve procedure. The rate of complications in the 30-day period after surgery was 5 percent for gastric bypass, 2.6 percent for sleeve gastrectomy and 2.9 percent for adjustable gastric banding. </p><p>The complications measured in the study included death, reoperation/repair procedures, clots, or failure to be discharged from the hospital within 30 days.</p><p>Gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy are similar in terms of cost, according to Arterburn. Each procedure averages between $20,000 and $30,000, he estimated. Adjustable gastric banding is less expensive and may average around $15,000, he noted. Insurance coverage for these procedures varies quite a bit, and not all will cover weight-loss surgery. </p><p>Dr. Mitchell Roslin, director of the bariatric surgery program at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y., said that people shouldn't only focus on the total weight loss when trying to select a procedure. </p><p>\"There is no perfect way. The more we change the body, the higher the weight loss, but complications may be higher. There's no one-size-fits-all weight-loss surgery,\" said Roslin, who wasn't involved with the study. </p><p>\"The decision really requires detailed conversation and education. You need to understand your own individual medical issues and objectives,\" he said. </p><p>Arterburn added that people should look for a surgeon that has experience in multiple weight-loss procedures. </p><p>\"Not every surgeon is equally comfortable with all of the procedures. Have a conversation with a surgeon who does all of the surgeries so the conversation is about what's right for you,\" he said. </p><p>The findings were published Oct. 29 in the <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases has more about <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/bariatric-surgery\" target=\"_new\"> weight-loss surgery</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Oct. 22, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- For some college students in the United States, the 2016 presidential election triggered significant distress symptoms, a new survey suggests.</p><p>Nearly 800 students were surveyed at one university. One-quarter suffered distress levels similar to what's seen among witnesses to a mass shooting, researchers said.</p><p>Such stress can interfere with daily tasks, including academic work. It can also be predictive of symptoms seen in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the researchers said in background notes.</p><p>However, the findings don't mean the election caused PTSD in those students, said Melissa Hagan, the lead researcher on the study.</p><p>The election and its outcome do not constitute a \"trauma\" as defined by the American Psychiatric Association, explained Hagan, an assistant professor of psychiatry at San Francisco State University.</p><p>By that definition, a trauma refers to an immediate threat to a person's physical safety or life.</p><p>\"These students were not assessed for PTSD, and therefore cannot be diagnosed as having PTSD or not,\" Hagan said.</p><p>But the findings do add to evidence that the political climate since the 2016 election has been a source of stress for many Americans.</p><p>The American Psychological Association (APA) conducts an annual \"Stress in America\" survey. Last year, it found that nearly two-thirds of Americans were stressed over the future of the nation -- making it the most commonly reported source of stress (just beating out perennial issues such as money and work.)</p><p>Lynn Bufka is a psychologist and associate executive director of practice research and policy at the APA.</p><p>While the new study asked different questions, the findings are \"certainly consistent\" with the APA survey, said Bufka.</p><p>She said the post-election political climate may have been enough to create an unusual amount of stress for some people.</p><p>Bufka noted that the survey was done about two to three months after the 2016 election.</p><p>\"At that point, people may have come to terms with the election results,\" Bufka said.</p><p>But, she added, many people may have been increasingly stressed by news reports, social media posts and face-to-face interactions with people who did not necessarily share their political views.</p><p>\"The general tenor of conversations shifted after the election. And that can be stressful in itself,\" Bufka said.</p><p>Hagan agreed that the aftermath of the election may partly explain students' distress levels.</p><p>The findings come from a survey of 769 students at Arizona State University.</p><p>They all completed a standard questionnaire on stress responses to \"significant life events.\" It asked them, for example, whether thoughts of the election cropped up in their daily lives, when they didn't actually want to think about it; or whether they actively avoided reminders of the election.</p><p>Not surprisingly, perhaps, students who identified as Democrats or Independents had higher distress scores than Republicans. Racial minorities, women, lower-income people and non-Christians scored higher, too.</p><p>The findings were reported Oct. 22 in the <i>Journal of American College Health</i>.</p><p>Since the survey was done at one university, Hagan said, the results would not be representative of all young Americans. </p><p>But she said that, to her, the message is straightforward: If the election stressed you out, \"you're not alone.\"</p><b>Unplugging may help</b><p>For people who are distressed by today's political climate, Hagan said it might help to take more breaks from political news, including social media -- unless that's how you get your social support.</p><p>Bufka agreed that media breaks can offer some needed perspective, especially for people who think they need to stay on top of all the news.</p><p>She also suggested volunteering, either with a political campaign or any cause you care about. \"That helps you feel that you're having an impact, even when things feel like they're out of your control,\" she said.</p><p>And, Bufka said, never underestimate the importance of adequate sleep, exercise and a healthy diet -- especially when you're stressed.</p><p>Those tips do not just apply to unhappy Democrats -- or any one group, Bufka said. In the APA survey, stress over the nation's future cut across party lines.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For advice on dealing with stress related to political change, visit the <a href=\" https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/stress-political-change.aspx\" target=\"_new\">American Psychological Association</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 21, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- No  respectable Thanksgiving plate is without some form of cranberry, but the  fruit's popularity seems to plummet the other 364 days of the year.</p><p>That's a shame, nutrition experts say, because cranberries  deliver a bundle of health benefits. And they're quite efficient: A cup of raw cranberries  carries just 50 calories.</p><p>So why aren't they more of an everyday food? It may come  down to taste.</p><p>\"They're  a little bit more bitter than blueberries or other berries that have those  phytochemicals  and a little bit crunchier,\" said Maya Vadiveloo, an assistant  professor in the Department of Nutrition and Food Sciences at the University of  Rhode Island.</p><p>\"I  think you can start to get used to almost any flavor over time, but I think we  may have this bias that all fruit needs to be sweet,\" she  said. \"It might just be that people have not really thought that much  about cranberries, unless it's around Thanksgiving.\" </p><p>Among the health benefits associated with cranberries:</p><ul>  <li> The vitamins and minerals they contain boost the body's digestive  health and antioxidant system and promote good heart health  even possibly  improving blood pressure and cholesterol.</li>  <li>They are high in fiber. But contrary to common perception,  the most recent research has not definitively shown that cranberry products  help prevent or treat urinary tract infections.</li>  <li>In laboratory studies, they've been linked to a lower risk  of certain types of cancer.</li>  <li>They contain chemicals that may combat norovirus and other  food-borne illnesses.</li></ul><p>\"Cranberries may be a little underutilized,\" Vadiveloo said.  \"They're not nearly as expensive as many other berries, and at Thanksgiving,  the greater variety of fruits and vegetables that you have around  things like  stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy  if you're balancing your plate with a little  bit of everything, you tend to eat less of all the things and still feel very  satisfied.\"</p><p>One popular way to work cranberries into a daily diet all  year long is by adding dried cranberries to a salad. And while cranberries may  taste better when they're dried than when they're raw, that sweetness comes at  a high cost.</p><p>Nutritionally speaking, dried cranberries may be closer to  candy than they are to fruit. A 1/3-cup serving of dried cranberries carries  123 calories. Worse, most of the nutrients found in raw cranberries are nowhere  to be found in the dried version.</p><p>One cup of chopped raw cranberries, for example, contains  14.6 mg of vitamin C per serving, while one cup of dried cranberries contains  0.3 mg.</p><p>\"If you start to think that one of the snack-size Halloween  candies is 60 to 110 calories, you could have two cups of raw cranberries for  that amount  and feel fuller, and have a lot of the beneficial effects,\"  Vadiveloo said.</p><p>Similarly, sweetened cranberry sauce, a Thanksgiving staple,  contains 418 calories with just 5.5 mg of vitamin C per one-cup serving.</p><p>\"For almost any food, the preparation matters,\" Vadiveloo  said. \"Most foods can be healthy, especially in their raw form. But when we  start doing things to them, we need to be more concerned about the health  effects. If you're trying to start eating more cranberries, even if you're  planning to add sweetener, doing it yourself versus buying something that's  already pre-processed is better.</p><p>\"People tend to add far less of their own sweetener than  what's in commercially prepared food.\"</p><p>Another popular way people may try to add cranberries to the  diet is by drinking them. Cranberry juice is often combined with other fruit  juices, such as grape or apple, for a better flavor.</p><p>As with any juice, it's important to consider the amount of  sweetener that's added. Unsweetened cranberry juice contains 116 calories and  23.5 mg of vitamin C per one-cup serving. Also, it's worth noting that  cranberry juice may interact with certain medications.</p><p>And of course, cranberries are popular in muffins. But  depending on how they are made, muffins aren't necessarily a nutritionist's  favorite choice, Vadiveloo said: \"We don't want to see a muffin claim health  benefits just because it has cranberries, you know?\"</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 22, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- With more and more research uncovering the best foods for health, people are learning how important it is to focus on food <i>quality</i> to prevent weight gain and live longer.</p><p>There are many approaches to consider. For instance, findings show that a diet high in fiber, especially from fruits and vegetables, can lower stroke risk. Following a DASH-style diet -- which is rich in whole grains and low in red meat -- boosts heart health by lowering blood pressure and cholesterol. And the Mediterranean-style diet, which uses olive oil as the primary fat and encourages mostly plant-based foods, is another great choice for longevity.</p><p>Principles from each of these diets can be combined to raise the overall quality of your diet and help you meet health goals. In fact, a Harvard study found that simply eating more whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and fewer sweetened beverages and less saturated fat can reduce type 2 diabetes risk by about 20 percent.</p><p>People also need to know what's not healthy and should be avoided. Another Harvard study identified key culprits -- potato chips, processed and unprocessed red meat, as well as sugar-sweetened beverages. Starches, refined grains, fats and sugars all lead to weight gain, while increasing high-quality foods can actually help you eat fewer calories overall because they're more satisfying.</p><p>One interesting finding is that the healthiest diets are made up of a rather small range of good-for-you foods. And the concept of eating whatever you want if you do so in moderation isn't the sound approach it was thought to be.</p><p>Boosting diet quality starts at the supermarket. Focus on the perimeter where you'll find produce, low-fat dairy, seafood and poultry, rather than the aisles where packaged and process foods are stocked.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn about the benefits of the <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/dash-eating-plan \" target=\"_new\">DASH diet</a> from the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.</p>",

And you don't have to give up your home gym or on-your-own workouts. Think of adding a gym routine as a way to make your fitness efforts more well-rounded.</p><p>According to the American Council on Exercise (ACE), one of the top benefits of belonging to a gym is the individualized guidance you'll get from a professional, something lacking when it's just you and your DVD player at home, for instance.</p><p>Signing up for a regular class will heighten your sense of accountability. You'll be more likely to stick with your fitness plan if you've paid for a membership or a block of classes in advance.</p><p>Classes also offer a social component you can't get at home, with support from your peers and an increased sense of motivation as participants encourage each other. Almost any type of exercise class can turn a workout from drudgery to a fun experience, one you'll really look forward to.</p><p>Even if you're a master in your favorite fitness activity, joining a class can bring a new dynamic to your workout or enable you to take it to a more challenging level.</p><p>It's important to note that teaching group classes is as much of a skill as being a personal trainer.

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Oct. 11, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- During the last few months of her pregnancy, Lisa Livesay closed the door to the nursery she and her husband, Chris, had created for their third child. She couldn't bear to look inside, not knowing if the cozy space would ever be home to their baby.</p> <p>The couple had anticipated their usual complications -- Lisa's first two pregnancies were rough and those children (another son and a daughter) were delivered prematurely. But an ultrasound taken 17 weeks into this pregnancy led to a discovery much more frightening: Their unborn son, Kaden, had a rare congenital heart defect. Instead of having two separate arteries to carry blood to the lungs and body, he had only a large one for the body, thus compromising the lungs. The condition is called truncus arteriosus.</p> <p>Doctors downplayed the diagnosis, saying, \"He'll just have a few heart surgeries and he'll be fine.\" But then Lisa and Chris visited with specialists at Children's Hospital Colorado in Denver.</p> <p>\"You don't understand how bad this is,\" doctors told them, \"and we don't know if we can fix this.\" </p> <p>Adding to their concern was the detection of a second serious issue, a leaky aortic valve.</p> <p>Worst of all, the doctors described a Catch-22 situation: If Lisa delivered Kaden prematurely, he might be too small to operate on; if he went to full term, the stress of the birth would likely leave him in late-stage heart failure.</p> <p>\"I felt like a ticking time bomb,\" she said. \"We had no idea if he could be fixed or if he'd survive the birth.\"</p> <p>Kaden was born six weeks early, on Nov. 5, 2013, sharing a birthday with his father. Unlike Lisa's other two deliveries, there were no complications, so she was able to hold him briefly, which she hadn't been able to do with her son Nathan, now 12, and Emma, 7. </p> <p>\"I wanted to be able to touch my baby first before anyone else,\" she said. \"It was very special. He came out screaming at the top of his lungs and shaking his fists. And although he was a little grayish blue, you could tell he was ready for a fight.\"</p> <p>Still, Chris said, \"We were afraid that in a few days we were going to be saying goodbye to him.\" </p> <p>Six days later, Kaden underwent a surgery to correct his congenital heart defect. Doctors used a conduit to reroute his blood flow. Doctors feared that Kaden wouldn't survive the trauma of the nine-hour operation.</p> <p>\"The doctors were absolutely blown away,\" Lisa said. \"They started calling him Rocky because he was such a fighter.\"</p> <p>The leaky valve remained a threat. However, because Kaden was so small, doctors chose to wait to repair it.</p> <p>\"Those were the worst six months of my life,\" Lisa said. \"I wasn't the mom with a child -- I was the nurse with a patient. It was all about therapies and doctor's visits -- every single field of medicine. He was on oxygen and 12 medications and didn't have the energy to eat, so we had to put a tube directly into his stomach.\"</p> <p>Kaden's breathing eventually became more labored, adding to the urgency of repairing the valve. But doctors said he was still too small.</p> <p>Searching for a solution, their surgeon, Dr. Max Mitchell, read an article about a case in which surgeons came at this same problem in a different way. The next day, he told Lisa and Chris about it. He acknowledged that it was \"extraordinarily high risk\" but he also seemed confident.</p> <p>\"Let's do it,\" they said.</p> <p>The procedure took 13 hours. Finally, Mitchell appeared.</p> <p>\"He was smiling, and we rarely saw him smile,\" Lisa said. \"If he was feeling good, so were we.\"</p> <p>Kaden improved every month, becoming pinker and more energetic. He eventually went off supplemental oxygen and a feeding tube. His immune system continues to strengthen.</p> <p>Four years later, he remains on blood thinners because of his mechanical valve. He'll face more surgeries as his heart endures more wear and tear.</p> <p>\"We welcome the fact that he's great for now, but we also know that harder days will be ahead,\" Chris said. \"And while we don't want to treat Kaden with kid gloves, of course we have to be careful. It's a balancing act.\"</p>",

All were randomly assigned either to a control group that received usual discharge instructions and stroke pamphlets, or to a group that took part in a culturally tailored, skills-based stroke prevention program that used bilingual materials. </p><p>Before leaving the hospital, patients in the program worked with a community health coordinator to learn how to communicate with their doctors, take prescribed medicines as recommended, and improve their blood vessel health.</p><p>Patients received follow-up phone calls three days, one month and three months after leaving the hospital.</p><p>One year after discharge, blood pressure among Hispanics who participated in the program averaged 9.9 mm Hg lower than in the control group. That translates to a nearly 40 percent reduction in their stroke risk, according to the New York University researchers.</p> <p>There were no significant differences, however, in blood pressure between groups of white and black patients in the study.</p><p>\"Our findings show the promise of focusing on skills that people can really use -- enhancing communication with their physician, or clarifying their medication regimen -- so they feel they can do something to reduce their risk of stroke,\" study lead author Bernadette Boden-Albala said in an NYU news release.

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Oct. 15, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Despite a flood of news reports on the opioid crisis, many people still want the potentially addictive painkillers after surgery, a new survey suggests.</p><p>The survey, of more than 500 patients scheduled for surgery, found that more than three-quarters expected to get opioids afterward. Most also thought opioids were the most effective treatment for post-surgery pain.</p><p>But experts said that while the drugs do ease pain in the short term, they are not the only option -- or necessarily the best one.</p><p>Prescription opioids -- which include painkillers like OxyContin, Vicodin and codeine -- carry a risk of breathing suppression, overdose and possible addiction.</p><p>But even their more mundane-sounding side effects can be significant, said Dr. Asokumar Buvanendran, who chairs the American Society of Anesthesiology's Pain Committee.</p><p>The drugs can cause constipation, nausea and vomiting, he said -- which are not trivial matters, particularly for older people with medical conditions.</p><p>So surgery patients should discuss all their pain relief options with their doctor, and balance the benefits against the risks, said Buvanendran, who was not involved in the new study.</p><p>\"For more severe acute pain, opioids are effective,\" he said. \"But the question is, are they the best choice for your surgery?\"</p><p>After years of skyrocketing, prescriptions for opioids have been declining in the United States since 2012, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Recently, concern has focused on the rising rate of overdose deaths from illegal opioids -- namely, heroin and illicitly made synthetic fentanyl.</p><p>Still, in 2017, doctors wrote almost 58 opioid prescriptions for every 100 Americans, the CDC says. And nationwide, about 40 percent of opioid overdose deaths involved a prescription drug.</p><p>Various medical groups say doctors should prescribe opioids sparingly for acute pain -- including after surgery. That means prescribing just a small number of pills -- usually a three-day supply or less -- at the lowest dose possible, according to the CDC.</p><p>For the latest study, researchers surveyed 503 adults undergoing surgery at their hospital. The procedures including knee or hip replacements, and back, abdominal or ear/nose/throat surgeries.</p><p>Overall, 77 percent said they expected to get opioids, while 37 percent expected acetaminophen (such as Tylenol), and only 18 percent thought they'd receive ibuprofen (such as Motrin).</p><p>Most patients also believed opioids were the best way to manage post-surgery pain -- including 94 percent of those who expected to receive the drugs.</p><p>Dr. Nirmal Shah presented the findings this weekend at the annual meeting of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, in San Francisco. </p><p>\"People naturally want the most effective pain treatment, and they often assume that means opioids,\" said Shah, an anesthesia resident at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.</p><p>But, he said, the right pain management depends on various factors, including the type of surgery and patients' personal health and pain tolerance.</p><p>Opioids might help for a short time after surgery in the hospital, according to Shah. But ideally, he said, patients should be discharged with other pain-relief plans.</p><p>A second study presented at the meeting found that when it came to back surgery, patients on opioids seemed to fare worse.</p><p>In a review of nine studies, researchers found that patients prescribed opioids after surgery had more pain and gave lower ratings to their quality of life, versus those who used non-drug options -- such as exercise therapy.</p><p>And those who were using opioids for pain relief before surgery generally faced tougher recoveries: They tended to have a longer hospital stay after surgery, and were more likely to be readmitted to the hospital, compared with other patients.</p><p>In an earlier study, Shah said, his team found that relatively younger surgery patients were \"more reluctant\" to use opioids, while older patients had fewer reservations.</p><p>\"That may be because the younger generation is more educated about the opioid epidemic,\" he speculated.</p><p>Yet, Buvanendran said, the side effects of opioids can be more dangerous for older patients.</p><p>Shah suggested that patients talk to their surgical team and their anesthesiologist about what to expect as far as pain, and what can be done about it during surgery, during their hospital stay, and after they go home.</p><p>Findings presented at meetings are generally considered preliminary until they are published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Mayo Clinic has more on <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/pain-medications/art-20046452\" target=\"_new\">pain relief after surgery</a>.</p>",

The agency will also mandate age-verification measures for online sales to prevent minors from buying the flavor pods.</p><p> \"I think that there's a perception that e-cigarettes are a safer alternative for kids,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a recent interview with the <i>Times</i>. \"But it can lead to a lifelong addiction, and some percentage will migrate to combustible products.\" </p><p>So, \"in order to close the on-ramp to e-cigarettes for kids, we have to put in place some speed bumps for adults,\" Gottlieb said, referring to efforts such as the proposed ban.</p><p>The FDA first began its crackdown on flavored e-cigarettes earlier this year, as the number of teens using the products reached epidemic proportions, the <i>Times</i> reported. By far, the leading vaping product is made by Juul, whose e-cigarette devices resemble small computer flash drives. Use of Juul has skyrocketed among teens over the past year, and the company's products now command 70 percent of the market.</p><p>Flavored versions of e-cigarettes -- including chicken and waffles, rocket Popsicle and \"unicorn milk\" -- have boosted sales among the young even further, experts contend.</p><p>\"The availability of flavors in e-cigarettes is one of the top reasons that middle and high school students cite as their motivation for using e-cigarettes,\" said Patricia Folan, director of the Center for Tobacco Control at Northwell Health in Great Neck, N.Y. \"Young people are more likely to try flavored e-cigarettes and consider them less harmful than tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes.\"</p><p>Responding to the trend, the FDA recently warned several e-cigarette makers to stop marketing to teenagers or risk being banned. Major companies were given 60 days to prove they could keep their devices away from minors, and the deadline is this weekend. Companies involved include Juul, RJR Vapor Co.'s Vuse, Imperial Brands' blu and devices made by Logic.</p><p>None of the companies have responded to requests by the <i>Times</i> for comment.</p><p>The FDA also warned 1,100 retailers to stop selling e-cigarettes to minors and fined some of them, the <i>Times</i> reported.</p><p>Folan applauded the FDA's move.</p><p>\"Although the FDA plan is not a complete ban of flavored e-cigarettes, this measure is a very significant step in preventing youth initiation of e-cigarette products, which some studies have shown results in teens smoking combustible cigarettes as well,\" she said.</p><p>The proposed ban comes after months of meetings between the FDA and e-cigarette makers on how to reduce teen use of the devices.</p><p>In a statement last week, Gottlieb said some e-cigarette makers also seemed to support raising the minimum age for buying tobacco products to 21 years, the <i>Times</i> reported.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse has more about <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/electronic-cigarettes-e-cigarettes\" target=\"_new\">e-cigarettes</a>.</p>",

Medications called bile acid sequestrants can help, but patients have to take them several times a day,\" explained study co-author Dr. Violeta Popov. She's an assistant professor of medicine at NYU School of Medicine and Langone Medical Center in New York City. </p><p>In years past, surgeons often removed the gallbladder as part of weight-loss surgeries. However, as weight-loss surgeries have become less invasive, with smaller and smaller incisions, surgeons stopped taking the gallbladder out during the procedure, Popov said. She's also director of bariatric endoscopy at VA New York Harbor Healthcare System. </p><p>The researchers looked at records from a national sample of inpatient admissions and found more than 1.5 million admissions for gallstones, other gallbladder conditions and acute pancreatitis from 2006 to 2014. The average patient age was between 52 and 64 years old. </p><p>The findings showed that there was a 10- to 100-fold higher risk of these conditions in people who had undergone weight-loss surgery. And the average patient age was 43 to 55. </p><p>People who'd had  weight-loss surgery were less likely to die, tended to stay less time in the hospital and their gallbladder disease tended to cost less to treat, the researchers said. </p><p>Dr. David Victor III, an American College of Gastroenterology expert, said it wasn't clear before this study that bariatric surgery boosted the risk of gallstones and other gallbladder conditions. </p><p>\"Obesity is known to increase the risk of gallstones, so patients who have indications for bariatric surgery would have an increased risk of gallstones,\" said Victor, who's also an assistant professor of medicine at the Institute for Academic Medicine at Houston Methodist.</p><p>\"This study is interesting because patients who have bariatric surgery may be at risk for gallstones that we have underappreciated before,\" Victor said.</p><p>Both Victor and Popov said it's too soon to recommend again removing the gallbladder when having weight-loss surgery, but it's a question worthy of additional study.</p><p>Popov said the rapid weight loss is likely what triggers the gallbladder conditions, though the study did not prove that.</p><p> Victor said it's also too soon to know why there's an increased risk, but it could be because people are obese or it may be a technical aspect of the surgery that boosts the risk. And, he added, it's possible the risk is not permanent.</p><p>He agreed that doctors should consider putting patients on bile acid sequestrants to help prevent gallstones and other conditions. </p><p>The study was presented Monday at the American College of Gastroenterology annual meeting, in Philadelphia. Research presented at medical meetings should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. </p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>Learn more about gallstones from the <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/gallstones\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Oct. 19, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- As the use of marijuana is growing, with Canada legalizing the drug just this week, a new study that ties pot to a raised risk for stroke might give users pause.</p><p>The risk for any stroke could increase by 15 percent and it could jump 29 percent for an ischemic stroke -- the most common kind, said lead investigator Dr. Krupa Patel. She is a research physician at Avalon University School of Medicine in Willemstad, Curacao.</p><p>Patel cautioned that the study can't prove that using marijuana causes strokes, only that the two are associated.</p><p>\"We can't establish causation, but what we can say is that recreational marijuana users are at higher risk in terms of stroke,\" she said.</p><p>In addition, the researchers don't know if the risk is tied to smoking marijuana or ingesting it in other ways, and whether it depends on the amount of the drug used or if it is due to other psychoactive ingredients mixed in with the marijuana.</p><p>Patel said the risk may be exacerbated by chronic medical conditions of the marijuana users who had strokes, such as diabetes or obesity.</p><p>Also, the researchers could not tell from the data whether marijuana users used other drugs like cocaine or smoked tobacco, she said.</p><p>Still, more strokes occurred among marijuana users than nonusers, which leaves open the question of what accounts for the increase in risk.</p><p>\"At this point we can just say there is this increased risk,\" Patel said.</p><p>The best way to sort out whether marijuana is truly associated with an increase in stroke is in a clinical trial, said Dr. Thalia Field, an assistant professor of neurology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.</p><p>\"It's too early to say that this is causative,\" she said. \"It has to be borne out in other studies.\"</p><p>In the study, Patel and her colleagues found that among more than 2.3 million American  recreational marijuana users who were hospitalized, the risk of stroke rose, compared with people who didn't use the drug.</p><p>Between 2010 and 2014, strokes among marijuana users steadily increased, even though the overall stroke rate remained unchanged, Patel said.</p><p>Among marijuana users in the study, more than 32,000 had a stroke -- including nearly 19,500 who suffered an ischemic stroke.

Those samples revealed that 46 percent of the youngsters had detectable levels of the marijuana metabolite tetrahydrocannabinol carboxylic acid (COOH-THC), and 11 percent had detectable levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.</p><p>THC is an indicator of both recent and active exposure to marijuana, and a higher level of exposure overall.</p><p>\"These are worrisome results, suggesting nearly half of the children of parents who smoke marijuana are getting exposed, and 11 percent are exposed to a much greater degree,\" Wilson said.</p><p>Most parents (84 percent) said no one ever smoked marijuana inside their homes, while 7.4 percent said marijuana was smoked in their home daily, the researchers said.</p><p>When asked what happened if someone wanted to smoke marijuana in the home while the children were present, 52 percent of parents said there was no smoking when children were home, 22 percent stepped outside, and nearly one in 10 smoked in another room or another floor.</p><p>One-third of children whose parents stepped outside to smoke tested positive for COOH-THC, according to the report published online Nov. 19 in <i>Pediatrics</i>.</p><p>\"Stepping outside might sound like a good idea, but the evidence we collected suggests that kids are still getting exposed through secondhand or possibly thirdhand smoke exposure,\" Wilson said.</p><p>\"We know that thirdhand smoke -- smoke that lingers in our hair, our clothes, even our skin -- results in biological exposure that we can detect.

You may also have a higher risk of complications during labor.</p><p>Just as it's now recommended to start taking supplemental nutrients such as folic acid before getting pregnant, talk to your primary care doctor or your ob-gyn about steps you can take to lose weight. Those steps can include improving your diet and getting more exercise as part of a multi-prong way to shed pounds well before you try to conceive. Also work with your healthcare provider to get any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, under good control.</p><p>Know that your starting weight is now used to determine what you should gain during pregnancy. The guideline for an average weight gain during pregnancy is 25 to 35 pounds if you're at normal weight.</p><p>But if you're overweight, with a body mass index between 25 and 29.9, you should gain only 15 to 25 pounds. And if you're obese, with a body mass index of 30 or higher, the recommendation is for a pregnancy weight gain of between 11 to 20 pounds.</p><p>It's very hard to get through pregnancy without gaining more weight than you planned.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently launched an ambitious campaign to warn teens about the dangers of e-cigarettes and to stop Juul sales to young people.</p><p>Juul devices resemble a traditional USB flash drive, but they pack a potent nicotine punch. Each colorful e-liquid pod contains as much nicotine as a pack-and-a-half to two packs of traditional cigarettes, Halpern-Felsher said.</p><p>Experts are concerned that Juuls are tailor-made to target a youth audience, given the sleek look of the devices and the fact that the pods come in many different fruit and candy flavors.</p><p>Juul Labs responded to the new study with a statement denying the products' appeal to young people.</p><p>\"We agree that underage use of Juul is completely unacceptable and it is directly opposed to our mission of eliminating cigarettes by offering existing adult smokers a true alternative to combustible cigarettes. We stand committed to working with those who want to keep nicotine products out of the hands of young people,\" the company said in a statement.</p><p>For the study, the researchers asked 445 California teens and young adults about their knowledge of and use of Juul, as part of a larger tobacco study that's been ongoing since 2014.</p><p>About half of the participants had heard of Juul, and around 16 percent had used the brand -- fewer than had used other forms of e-cigarettes (30 percent) or conventional tobacco cigarettes (24 percent).</p><p>But Juul users reported using their device more often over the past week and past month than either smokers or other e-cigarette users, the findings showed.</p><p>Juul users had vaped an average 1.5 days during the past week, and 6.7 days within the past month.</p><p>By comparison, cigarette users smoked an average 0.7 days during the past week and 3 days within the past month. Users of other types of e-cigarettes vaped 0.8 days within the past week and 3.2 days during the past month.</p><p>Juul users also scored as high as users of other e-cigarettes on the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist, a questionnaire designed to gauge nicotine addiction, the researchers found.</p><p>Flavors appeared to be attractive to Juul users. About 28 percent said their first pod ever vaped was fruit-flavored and 27 percent said it was menthol or mint-flavored, according to the report.</p><p>\"Youth are using more the fruit- and mint-flavored,\" Halpern-Felsher said. \"That's what's attracting them to using these products, whereas if you kept Juul as a product that was more for adults and only flavored like classic tobacco, youth may not be using them.\"</p><p>Halpern-Felsher added that she's very concerned that teenagers are creating a lifelong addiction by using Juul.</p><p>\"In young people with developing brains, you can become addicted with a few cigarettes if you're using regularly,\" Halpern-Felsher said. \"We do know from other vaping products that adolescents and young adults who use those products are significantly more likely to go on to use a combustible cigarette product.\"</p><p>But Dr. Christy Sadreameli, a spokeswoman for the American Lung Association, said that even if teens don't move on to smoking cigarettes after using Juul, they are still creating an addiction that will cost them.</p><p>\"I would say even if they just stay with Juul forever, indefinitely, they've created an addiction that's going to be expensive. It may be life-long,\" Sadreameli said. </p><p>\"It's much more likely to be a permanent thing, because teens have an underdeveloped prefrontal cortex of their brain. They're more likely to get addicted, in general,\" she explained. \"Using a very high-potency nicotine product during that vulnerable period of life, it's just a bad combination.\"</p><p>Action needs to be taken to remove flavors from all e-cigarettes, including Juul, Halpern-Felsher said. Regulators also should step in and block advertising that targets teenagers.</p><p>\"Youth, when shown advertisements for flavored vapes, they really believe those ads are targeting them,\" Halpern-Felsher said. \"We really need to get flavors out of the products and out of the ads.\"</p><p>The new study was published online Oct. 19 in the journal <i>JAMA Network Open</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Cancer Institute has more about the <a href=\"https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/tcrb/guide-measures/honc.html\" target=\"_new\">Hooked on Nicotine Checklist</a>.</p>",

This means blood can pool and form clots that go to the brain, causing a stroke. </p><p>The good news from this study: Blood thinners can reduce the odds for stroke and maybe delay or prevent dementia, researchers say. </p><p>\"Our findings emphasize the need to improve the clinical management of patients with atrial fibrillation, which is very important since a considerable proportion of older people with atrial fibrillation are not using [anti-clotting] drugs,\" said study first author Mozhu Ding. She is with the Aging Research Center at the Karolinska Institute in Solna, Sweden. </p><p>For the study, Ding and her colleagues collected data on nearly 2,700 Swedes, average age 73. </p><p>Participants were examined at the start of the study and again after six years if they were younger than 78 or every three years for those older than that. None had dementia at the outset, and 9 percent had atrial fibrillation.</p><p>Over the study period, an additional 11 percent developed A-fib, and 15 percent developed dementia.</p><p>The researchers found that thinking and memory skills declined faster among those who had atrial fibrillation. They were 40 percent more likely to develop dementia than those without the heart condition.</p><p>However, those who took blood thinners because of the heart disorder had a 60 percent lower risk of developing dementia -- 11 percent taking anti-clot drugs developed dementia compared to 22 percent not taking them. No decreased risk was seen among those taking aspirin, the researchers found.</p><p>This study is observational, so it cannot prove that A-fib is a cause of dementia or that blood thinners prevent it. Still, the researchers believe additional efforts should be made to increase blood thinner use among older people with atrial fibrillation.</p><p>One limitation of the study is that Ding's group did not distinguish between different types of atrial fibrillation. Also, some A-fib cases may have been missed among those who didn't have symptoms.</p><p>One specialist said even tiny strokes that go unnoticed can be a gateway to dementia. </p><p>\"Atrial fibrillation is associated with formation of clots that travel to the brain,\" said Dr. Sam Gandy, director of the Mount Sinai Center for Cognitive Health in New York City. </p><p>It's been thought that blood thinners effectively prevent this, he said. </p><p>\"But with more refined neuropsychological exams and higher resolution scans we now see that while we are preventing major strokes, we apparently are not preventing formation of micro-clots that do more damage than previously realized,\" Gandy said. \"This is being recognized and documented more and more, as in the current study.\" </p><p>The report was published online Oct. 10 in the journal <i>Neurology</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Alzheimer's Association offers more details on <a href=\"https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia\" target=\"_new\">dementia</a>.</p>",

So now families have to go back every 3 months and pay $300 to get their temporary medical exemption updated.\"</p><p>These doctors are flying in the face of decades of work to develop and improve vaccines that \"beat back infectious diseases that plagued humanity since the species evolved,\" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore.</p><p>\"To hear of physicians advertising to issue medical exemptions, which are mostly unwarranted, is to spit in the face of those pioneers who gave us vaccines, and has made those physicians advocates of the primitive Dark Ages when vaccine-preventable diseases flourished,\" Adalja said.</p><p>The 2015 law made California the first state in nearly 35 years to eliminate personal belief exemptions for mandatory vaccinations, the study authors said in background notes. The law was prompted in part by a 2014 measles outbreak at Disneyland.</p><p>The law has had a positive effect on immunization rates overall in California, the researchers reported.</p><p>Following the law's implementation, the proportion of kindergartners who received all required vaccines increased to 95.1 percent in 2017-2018, up from 92.8 percent in 2015-2016.</p><p>The findings were published online Oct. 29 in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i>.</p><p>To get a ground-level assessment of the law's rollout, researchers interviewed 40 health officers representing about half of the local health jurisdictions in California.</p><p>The public health officials said they are concerned anti-vaccine parents denied personal belief exemptions for their children now are seeking out doctors willing to issue medical exemptions for a fee, Mohanty said.</p><p>Many of these medical exemptions cite conditions typically not considered barriers to immunization by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, such as a family history of allergies or autoimmune disorders, Mohanty said.</p><p>However, these conditions squeak by based on the regulatory language of the law, she said.</p><p>The number of medical exemptions issued has not yet reached the level of personal belief exemptions claimed prior to the law's passage, which for the 2015-2016 school year was about 2.4 percent, Mohanty said.</p><p>But if left unchecked, the rapid increase of medical exemptions could weaken vaccine protection for school kids, said Democratic state Sen. Dr. Richard Pan, a pediatrician and author of the California law.</p><p>\"They threaten community immunity and threaten the health of all children,\" Pan said of the exemptions.</p><p>Anti-vaccine parent groups appear to be sharing lists of doctors willing to issue medical exemptions for a fee, Pan said.</p><p>\"It's a very small number, but that's all it takes, right?\" said Pan, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study. \"They're charging $500 or more a pop for these exemptions, so they're definitely in it for the money.\"</p><p>Some of these doctors have been brought before the California Medical Board on ethics charges, the study reported.</p><p>But Pan suggested a more straightforward solution. He'd like to amend California law so public health officials would have the power to revoke doctors' authority to issue medical exemptions.</p><p>Pan argued the power to issue medical exemptions is a state-level public health function that has been delegated to doctors, and therefore could be rescinded if it's found they're taking advantage of patients.</p> <p>For example, West Virginia pediatricians do not have the ability to issue medical exemptions -- instead, they must apply to their state health department for exemptions on patients' behalf, Pan noted.</p><p>\"When someone abuses that authority that's been delegated to them, then the state should be able to take back that authority from that person,\" Pan said. \"And not only revoke that authority but then invalidate all of the medical exemptions that have been inappropriately written, as a threat to public health.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have more about <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/laws/state-reqs.html\" target=\"_new\">state vaccination requirements</a>.</p>",

He's assistant professor at the Litwin-Zucker Center for Alzheimer's Disease and Memory Disorders at The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, N.Y.</p> <p>In the new study, conducted on autopsied brains, Haroutunian and his colleagues developed a way to separate the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) in the brain from adjacent brain tissue. </p><p>They first used this method on the brains of 34 people who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and type 2 diabetes treated with standard diabetes drugs.</p><p>The researchers then compared those findings to an examination of 30 brains from people with Alzheimer's who did not have diabetes, and 19 brains of people who had experienced neither disease.</p><p>The study focused on changes in certain genetic \"markers\" tied closely to proper brain signaling.</p><p>According to the researchers, levels of about half of these markers were lower in the vessels and brain tissue of patients who had both Alzheimer's and diabetes. And the majority of the unhealthy genetic changes that are usually seen in Alzheimer's were missing in patients who had taken diabetes drugs. </p> <p>This all suggests that diabetes medications have a protective effect on the brains of Alzheimer's patients, the researchers said, which in turn might boost the search for effective therapies.</p><p>\"Most modern Alzheimer's treatments target amyloid plaques and haven't succeeded in effectively treating the disease,\" Haroutunian said in a Mount Sinai news release.</p><p>But the new study focused on \"insulin and diabetes medications such as metformin, [which are] FDA-approved and safely administered to millions of people,\" he said.</p><p>The new study suggests these drugs may \"have a beneficial effect on people with Alzheimer's,\" Haroutunian said. \"This opens opportunities to conduct research trials on people using similar drugs or on drugs that have similar effects on the brains' biological pathways and cell types identified in this study.\"</p><p>For his part, Giliberto said the results \"are not surprising,\" since experts have long noted links between diabetes' effects on blood sugar and blood vessel health, and brain health.</p><p>But he added that the study doesn't prove that these issues cause Alzheimer's, or whether diabetes medications could curb or stop the brain-wasting disease once it had begun.</p><p>However, \"treating chronic hyperglycemia will result in a reduction of further brain insult,\" Giliberto reasoned. For people with Alzheimer's disease, that \"might result in better cognitive performance and quality of life,\" he said.</p><p>Dr. Satjit Bhusri is a cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. Reviewing the study, he said it \"establishes a relationship between the blood vessels of the brain and Alzheimer's disease.\"</p><p>The findings could \"open the door to a new pathway that may be of therapeutic use in patients with Alzheimer's disease,\" Bhusri said.</p><p>The report was published online Nov. 1 in the journal <i>PLOS One</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Alzheimer's Association offers more on <a href=\"https://www.alz.org\" target=\"_new\">Alzheimer's disease</a>.</p>",

Most of the deaths were due to flash floods, tropical storms and heat waves.</p><p>The council urges everyone to keep an emergency kit at home and in the car. Kits should have basic needs to sustain a family for at least 72 hours.</p><p>Your emergency plan should include several methods of evacuation and identify places to shelter. You should also make emergency contact lists in case families get separated. And learn how your town alerts residents when severe weather or a natural disaster is near. </p><p>Tips for staying safe in hurricanes include: </p><ul><li>Board up windows and tie down loose items like patio furniture.</li><li>Establish a point for family members to meet if separated, and pick one person everyone can contact.</li><li>Shelter in sturdy buildings. Avoid isolated sheds or other small structures, open areas, hilltops, the beach and boats.</li><li>If you are driving in heavy rain, try to exit the road, stay in the car and turn on the emergency flashers.</li><li>Don't drive into flooded areas. If flood waters surround your car, leave the car and go to higher ground.</li><li>Avoid touching electrical equipment, cords, metal and water.</li><li>Listen for sirens, stay away from windows and outside doors, and seek shelter in a bathroom or basement.</li><li>Stay indoors until you're told it's safe to go outside.</li> </ul><p>Tips for flash floods include: </p><ul><li>Know your distance to rivers, streams and dams.</li><li>In heavy rain, stay away from underpasses, underground parking garages and basements.</li><li>Never walk in water above your ankles -- you could be swept off your feet in as little as 6 inches of rushing water.</li><li>Shut off the electricity and other utilities. </li></ul><p><small>Hurricane Michael as seen from the International Space Station<br>Video: NASA</small></p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the American Red Cross for more on <a href=\"https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/hurricane.html\" target=\"_new\">hurricane safety</a>.</p>",

Any dispute about a person's sex would have to be settled through genetic testing.</p><p>\"The sex listed on a person's birth certificate, as originally issued, shall constitute definitive proof of a person's sex unless rebutted by reliable genetic evidence,\" according to the proposed HHS definition, <i>The Times</i> reported.</p><p>After more than a year of discussions, HHS is expected to formally present the new definition to the Justice Department before the end of the year, according to Trump administration officials.</p><p>If the Justice Department decides that the new definition is legal, it can be enforced across government agencies.</p><p>The new definition would halt federal recognition of about 1.4 million people who recognize themselves as a gender other than the one they were born into, <i>The Times</i> reported.</p><p>\"This takes a position that what the medical community understands about their patients -- what people understand about themselves -- is irrelevant because the government disagrees,\" Catherine Lhamon, who led the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights in the Obama administration and helped write transgender guidance, told <i>The Times</i>.</p><p>This is the latest in a series of Trump administration attempts to reverse recognition and protections of transgender people. It has sought to prevent transgender people from serving in the military and has legally challenged transgender civil rights protections in the health care law.</p><p>\"Transgender people are frightened,\" Sarah Warbelow, the legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, which promotes the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, told <i>The Times</i>.</p><p>\"At every step where the administration has had the choice, they've opted to turn their back on transgender people,\" Warbelow said.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Immunotherapy-Chemo Combo Extends Lives of Women With Aggressive Breast Cancer</b></span></p><p>Treatment with immunotherapy plus chemotherapy extended the lives of women with an aggressive form of breast cancer longer than chemotherapy alone, researchers report.</p><p>The findings could lead to the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of an immunotherapy drug to treat breast cancer and may change the standard of care for women with advanced triple-negative breast cancer, according to <i>The New York Times</i>.</p><p>Triple-negative tumors occur in only about 15 percent of patients with invasive breast cancer in the United States (nearly 40,000 each year), but account for as many as 30 to 40 percent of breast cancer deaths.</p><p>The study included 902 patients treated at 246 medical centers in 41 countries. Half received chemotherapy alone (nab-paclitaxel/Abraxane), and half received chemotherapy plus Genentech's immunotherapy drug atezolizumab (Tecentriq), <i>The Times</i> reported.</p><p>Atezolizumab belongs to a class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, which help immune system T-cells recognize cancer and attack it.</p><p>Median survival was 17.6 months among those who received chemotherapy alone and 21.3 months among those who received the combination therapy. That difference was not statistically significant.</p><p>But among women with a marker called PD-L1 on their cancer cells, median survival was 15.5 months among those who received chemotherapy alone and 25 months in the combination group.</p><p>Those results have not been analyzed statistically, and the patients are still being followed, <i>The Times</i> reported.</p><p>The study was published Oct. 20 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> and was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology annual meeting in Munich.</p><p>Genentech has submitted the data to the FDA  to get approval of atezolizumab for treatment of triple-negative patients with the PD-L1 marker.</p><p>\"This is truly a game changer,\" study author Dr. Sylvia Adams, from NYU Langone Health's Perlmutter Cancer Center, told <i>The Times</i>.</p><p>She noted that cancer patients with the PD-L1 marker tend to respond better to checkpoint inhibitors than those without it. The marker was present in 41 percent of patients in this study.</p><p>After initial treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy, some patients have been doing well for two or three years with immunotherapy alone, Adams told <i>The Times</i>.</p><p>She added that the \"million-dollar question\" is whether they can safely stop the immunotherapy if they have no sign of cancer. For now, they are continuing with immunotherapy.</p><p>While she has received no payments from drug companies, her medical center did receive funding from Genentech to pay for the research, Adams said.</p><p>The new study \"is a big deal and has been the buzz of the breast cancer research world,\" Dr. Larry Norton, of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, told <i>The Times</i>.</p><p>He was not involved in the study, but has done paid consulting work for the past two years for Genentech.</p><p>The study results are \"very significant\" and it seems that chemotherapy \"takes away the invisibility cloak the cancer has managed to put on,\" Dr. Ingrid Mayer, a breast cancer specialist at Vanderbilt University, told <i>The Times</i>.</p><p>She was not part of the study, but has received consulting fees from seven drug companies, including Genentech.</p><p>The chemotherapy may help trigger the immune system, in part by killing cancer cells that then leak compounds that T-cells detect and begin to hunt, Mayer explained.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Ready-to-Eat Salads Recalled</b></span></p><p>Possible salmonella and listeria contamination has led to the recall of ready-to-eat salads sold at Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and other stores, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) said.</p><p>A number of companies have announced recalls.

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 29, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Cost and how much they can lose matter more to folks considering weight-loss surgery than recovery time or the risk of complications, a new study finds.</p><p>\"Instead of asking patients about the reasons for or against particular procedures, we asked patients to tell us what procedure characteristics mattered to them the most,\" said study lead author Michael Rozier. He worked on the study while studying health care policy at the University of Michigan.</p><p>The results show out-of-pocket costs matter a great deal to patients facing weight-loss (bariatric) surgery, Rozier said in a university news release.</p><p>The survey of 800 adults considering obesity surgery also found that the most commonly performed operation, sleeve gastrectomy, doesn't meet patients' highest priorities.</p><p>With sleeve gastrectomy, a portion of the stomach is removed, leaving a thinner stomach. With a gastric bypass, the stomach is made much smaller and rerouted to bypass part of the small intestine. Patients who have sleeve gastrectomy lose less weight the first year, on average, than patients who have gastric bypass surgery, according to the university research team. </p><p>\"We know there may be slightly better weight loss and increased comorbidity resolution [more weight-related health issues solved] with bypass, so recommending sleeve gastrectomy may be somewhat different than what patients in this study valued,\" said study co-author Dr. Amir Ghaferi, a bariatric surgeon at Michigan Medicine.</p><p>The findings can help doctors guide conversations with patients pondering weight-loss surgery, the researchers said.</p><p>They noted that even though cost is a main consideration for patients, health care providers are rarely trained to discuss that issue.</p><p>\"We probably need to figure out an appropriate way to incorporate cost into conversations providers have with their patients,\" said Rozier, now an assistant professor of health management and policy at Saint Louis University.</p><p>The study was published Nov. 28 in the journal <i>JAMA Surgery</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases has more on <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/bariatric-surgery\" target=\"_new\">weight-loss surgery</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Oct. 11, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Lesbian and gay couples might one day be able to produce offspring that share genetic traits from both parents, a study in mice has determined.</p><p>Researchers with the Chinese Academy of Sciences produced 29 healthy mouse pups from two mothers using stem cells and targeted gene editing, according to a new report.</p><p>\"Not only were they born, the reassuring part was that these pups went ahead and had offspring of their own later on,\" said Dr. Tomer Singer, director of reproductive endocrinology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>\"They were healthy enough to reproduce, which is important,\" added Singer, who was not involved in the experiment. </p><p>The Chinese research team also produced 12 live offspring from two genetic fathers, but the process was more complicated and the offspring lived only a few days. </p><p>Nevertheless, \"this study is a very important first step to prove the concept that in mammals, you may not need a male and a female parent,\" Singer said.</p><p>Still, experts note that research in animals often doesn't pan out in humans.</p><p>The research was published online Oct. 11 in the journal <i>Cell Stem Cell</i>. </p><p>Some reptiles, fish and amphibians can have babies without requiring sperm from a father and an egg from a mother, but that's not the case with mammals, said co-senior study author Qi Zhou. He is a professor with the Institute of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.</p><p>\"We were interested in the question of why mammals can only undergo sexual reproduction,\" Zhou said in a journal news release.</p><p>For their experiment, the investigators relied on haploid embryonic stem cells. Haploid stem cells contain half the number of  chromosomes and DNA as normal stem cells, which typically have a blend of genetic material from both parents.</p><p> Singer explained that the researchers \"removed half of the genetic material because that's what happens in nature, once the sperm penetrates the egg. Half of the genetic material comes from the mom, and half comes from the dad.\"</p><p>But there was another reproductive hurdle that had to be overcome --  that of genomic imprinting.</p><p>Mammals inherit two working copies of most genes, one from mom and one from dad. But in specific cases, genes are \"imprinted\" and mammals inherit only one working copy -- either from the dad or the mom.</p><p>\"This is a very important step in reproduction that essentially shuts down some genes once the egg and sperm are fertilized and create an embryo,\" Singer said.</p><p>In mice, more than 100 genes have been confirmed to be imprinted, and about 50 imprinted genes have been detected in humans, according to a 2013 report in the journal <i>Molecular Aspects of Medicine</i>.</p><p>Inadequate genomic imprinting can cause reproductive failure, as well as severe developmental abnormalities, cancer and other health problems in babies who survive.</p><p>To get around this, the Chinese researchers deleted three genes involved in imprinting from the genetic information derived from the female mouse pair, and seven genes from the male mouse pair.</p><p>For the female couple, the process was relatively simple, according to the report. The haploid stem cells from one female essentially acted as sperm that was then injected into an egg from the other female mouse, who carried the pups to term.</p><p>The male couple required a donated empty egg from a female mouse. Into it went a blend of the two males' edited genetic information. A female mouse also was required to serve as a surrogate mother, carrying the male/male progeny to term.</p><p>Offspring from the male couple was not viable, probably because the correct imprinted genes were not deleted, Singer said.</p><p>\"It's either that they didn't shut down enough genes or too many genes or the wrong genes,\" Singer suggested.</p><p>For this process to work in humans, researchers would have to figure out which imprinted genes would need to be deleted in both women and men, he noted.</p><p>Scientists last year isolated and replicated the very first haploid human stem cells. But Singer predicts it will take decades to identify the specific imprinted genes that would need to be shut down to allow for healthy same-sex reproduction in humans.</p><p>Getting it wrong could cause birth defects, as well as other health problems that might not emerge for decades, Singer added.</p><p>\"That brings us to an ethical dilemma,\" he said. \"Are we creating a generation of animals and, in the future, human beings where we cannot predict how this will affect them? Will they have the life expectancy, will they develop cancer or heart disease or mental retardation or autism or other conditions?\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The University of Utah has more about <a href=\"https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/epigenetics/imprinting/\" target=\"_new\">genomic imprinting</a>.</p>",

Gout is caused by hyperuricemia -- high blood levels of uric acid, which forms crystals that collect around the joints.</p><p>In the study, New Zealand researchers analyzed genetic and diet data from nearly 17,000 American men and women of European ancestry.</p><p>The investigators found that diet was much less important than the individual patient's genes in deciding whether or not they would develop hyperuricemia.</p><p>The findings \"are important in showing the relative contributions of overall diet and inherited genetic factors\" in gout, wrote a team led by Dr. Tony Merriman of the University of Otago.</p><p>In a related editorial, rheumatologist Dr. Ed Roddy, of Keele University in the United Kingdom, said the findings have important psychological implications for patients.</p><p>That's because people with gout often face stigma due to the misconception that gout is a \"self-inflicted\" condition, caused by unhealthy lifestyle habits. That, in turn, can make some patients reluctant to seek medical help.</p><p>But the new research \"provides important evidence that much of patients' preponderance to hyperuricemia and gout is [genetic and] non-modifiable, countering these harmful but well-established views and practices,\" Roddy said.</p><p>For centuries, diet was considered the main risk factor for gout, and recent studies suggest that certain foods such as meat, shellfish, alcohol and sugary soft drinks are associated with a higher risk of gout, while other foods such as fruit, vegetables, low-fat dairy products and coffee may protect against gout.</p><p>But other studies have also shown that genetics plays an important role in gout.</p><p>Dr. Waseem Mir is a rheumatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

And with massive rainfall and 13-foot storm surges, flooding is a major danger as the storm tracks northward.</p><p>\"Floodwater places virtually all people at risk for drowning, even for experienced swimmers,\" warned Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"Fast-moving water can be lethal, and even shallow-appearing water can be deadly for toddlers and small children.\"</p><p>He stressed that trying to outrun the storm has its own dangers.</p><p>\"It's important to realize that vehicles do not guarantee sufficient protection from fast-moving floodwaters, as it's possible to stall out or be swept away in fast-moving water,\" Glatter said.</p><p>He added that the storm surge associated with a hurricane is particularly dangerous, especially if you live near the ocean, lakes or streams, which can rapidly overflow and lead to drowning.</p><p>One potentially lifesaving tip: \"Never drive into a standing pool of water on a road after a hurricane, as the water may rise rapidly and trap you in your vehicle,\" Glatter said.</p><p>Already, at least two people have died due to Michael -- a man from Greensboro, Fla., was killed when a tree crashed onto his home, and a girl in Seminole County, Ga., died when debris hit her home, <i>The New York Times</i> reported. Winds from the category 4 storm have topped 150 miles per hour.</p><p>\"It's vital to respect this dangerous time, and make plans to stay abreast of news alerts and keep in touch with family,\" Glatter said.</p><p>The aftermath of serious flooding brings other hazards, he said.</p><p>Flooded areas pose risks for fire hazards or electrical injury associated with downed power lines. \"Never approach a downed power line, as the risk of being electrocuted always exists,\" Glatter said. If you come upon one, contact the power company. </p><p>Floods may also increase the spread of waterborne diseases, including cholera, typhoid fever, hepatitis A, as well as leptospirosis.</p> <p>\"While most floods do not result in serious outbreaks of infectious disease or chemical toxicity, they can result in bacterial and viral infections involving the lung and GI tract in those who are exposed to contaminated floodwater,\" Glatter explained.</p><p>Waterborne infection may occur after washing, drinking or bathing in contaminated water, or by eating infected food. It's essential to boil all water for bathing, brushing your teeth or drinking after a flood, the ER doctor said. Bottled water is the safest bet. </p><p>\"Use only bottled water until the water supply is declared safe,\" Glatter said.</p><p>Hurricane Michael is tracking northward through the Carolinas, before it will make its way to the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>For anyone who still has time to evacuate, Glatter offered this advice:</p><ul><li>Have a family communications plan in case you get separated during the storm. Take your cellphone, and if it uses replaceable batteries, take extras. </li> <li>Carry a one- to two-week supply of any prescription medications. (Diabetics should keep extra insulin on hand, as well as a ready supply of snacks in case their sugar level drops. Store insulin or any liquid antibiotics on ice or cold packs during power failures. Have a list of your doctors with their contact information.</li><li>Patients who use a CPAP machine for sleep apnea or COPD may need an alternative power source during the storm. This includes a CPAP battery pack or marine battery adapters in case of electrical outage.</li><li>Take bottled water (at least 1 gallon daily per person for three to seven days).</li><li>Pack enough nonperishable food for three to seven days.</li><li>Take a flashlight with extra batteries, road maps, basic tools (pliers, wrench, duct tape), cash and coins, sleeping bags.</li><li>Store important documents in a water-resistant container or plastic bag.</li><li>Pack a first aid kit with ibuprofen, acetaminophen, antacids, adhesive tape, Benadryl (for any allergic reactions), motion-sickness medicine, alcohol wipes, forceps and tweezers, instant cold packs, bandage scissors, sterile gauze, elastic wraps, antiseptic solution, adhesive bandages, triple antibiotic ointment, exam gloves, gauze sponges (4 inch-by-4 inch), butterfly tape, sterile saline, hydrogen peroxide, and thermometer with extra batteries.</li><li>For infants, have plenty of diapers and wipes available, as well as formula, powdered milk and extra sanitized bottles.</li><li>Take along an extra pair of contact lenses or eyeglasses with cleaner.</li></ul><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the American Red Cross for more on <a href=\"https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/hurricane.html\" target=\"_new\">hurricane safety</a>.</p>",

She is head of family medicine and primary health care at Ghent University in Belgium.</p><p>Certain decongestants \"can have serious side-effects, such as hypertension, excitation and convulsions,\" De Sutter said.</p><p>The new evidence review lends additional weight to a 2008 warning issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that no cough and cold product should be given to children younger than 2, and they should be used only with caution in older kids.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics also recommends against the use of OTC cough and cold remedies for children younger than 4, said Dr. Jeffrey Gerber, medical director of the Antimicrobial Stewardship Program at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.</p><p>\"Generally speaking, at best in adults the risks and benefits are probably around equal. And in kids the risks outweigh the benefits,\" Gerber said.</p><p>The common cold is usually caused by viruses, and symptoms usually clear in seven to 10 days, the study authors noted in background notes. Children get about six to eight colds a year, compared with two to four colds annually for adults.</p><p>Current evidence from clinical trials shows decongestants provide little to no relief for children, the researchers said.</p><p>The study authors concluded that decongestants or medicines containing antihistamines should not be given to children under 6, and used with caution in children aged 6 to 12.</p><p>The tradeoff simply isn't worth it, Gerber said, even if the chances of a severe side-effect are minimal.</p><p>\"You can have interactions that can make your heart race, for example,\" he explained. \"If you had some type of underlying condition you may or may not know about, you could exacerbate that and cause an arrhythmia. That doesn't happen so often, but it is a possibility.\"</p><p>The OTC remedies don't work much better for adults, the study found. Using decongestants either alone or with antihistamines or pain relievers can have a small effect on blocked or runny noses, for up to three to seven days, the researchers said.</p><p>But adults run an increased risk of side-effects like insomnia, drowsiness, headache or stomach upset, the findings showed. Ironically, long-term use of decongestants can lead to chronic nasal congestion.</p><p>There's also inadequate evidence supporting other commonly used OTC or home treatments, such as steam, heated air humidifiers, analgesics, vapor rub, echinacea or probiotics, the report said.</p><p>Saline nasal irrigation or drops are a parent's safest way to relieve a child's stuffy nose, according to the report, but these may not work.</p><p>Parents can use acetaminophen (children's Tylenol) or ibuprofen (children's Motrin) to reduce fever, aches and pains in children, and a cool-mist humidifier can help nasal passages shrink to allow for easier breathing, the FDA suggests.

Now, new research suggests widening waistlines may be one reason why.</p><p>In the study, women aged 20 to 49 who were overweight or obese had up to twice the risk for colon cancer before age 50, compared with normal-weight women.</p><p>\"Our findings really highlight the importance of maintaining a healthy weight, beginning in early adulthood, for the prevention of early onset colorectal cancer,\" said study co-author Yin Cao. She's an assistant professor of surgery at Washington University in St. Louis.  </p><p>Even though obesity has been floated as a possible reason for rising colon cancer rates among the young, \"we were surprised by the strength of the link,\" Cao said in a university news release.</p><p>The study wasn't designed to prove cause and effect, only an association. But one colon cancer expert wasn't surprised by the finding.</p><p>Dr. Jeffrey Aronoff, a colorectal surgeon at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, noted that obesity has long been a risk factor for colon cancer in people over 50. \"I do believe that a healthy lifestyle, which includes diet, exercise,\" may help curb even younger people's odds for the disease, he said.</p><p>In the new study, Cao and her colleagues collected data on more than 85,000 U.S. women ages 25 to 44 who took part in a large, ongoing study.</p><p>Women who were heavy as teens and gained weight in early adulthood had an increased risk of colon cancer before age 50, the researchers found.</p><p>In fact, they estimated that about 22 percent of early onset colon cancers could have been prevented if those who were diagnosed had maintained a healthy weight. Across the whole American population, that could represent thousands of cases of early onset colon cancer that might be prevented.</p><p>The risk of early onset colon cancer for overweight and obese women was the same regardless of whether or not the woman had a family history of the disease. </p><p>Cao and her team members cautioned that the study cannot prove that increased weight causes early onset colon cancer, only that the two are associated. It is possible that weight is just a marker for other risk factors, such as diabetes or metabolic issues like high blood pressure or higher cholesterol, which have also been on the rise.</p><p>And the researchers stress that despite the rise in colon cancer among people under 50, it remains relatively rare, at about 8 cases per 100,000 people. Still, because screening for colon cancer usually starts at 50, those who develop it younger are often diagnosed when the disease is in its late stages and more difficult to treat. </p><p>That's why the American Cancer Society recently lowered its recommended age at which most people should have a first screening colonoscopy. The new guidelines advise that screening begins at 45, not 50 as in the previous guidelines. </p><p>Colon cancer expert Dr. Sherif Andrawes directs endoscopy at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City. He said the study \"is very important and confirms a recent observation among clinicians and experts in the field.\"</p><p>And Andrawes said there's another reason to urge Americans to get screened for colon cancer earlier.</p><p>\"A bigger concern is those younger patients with cancer present symptomatic at diagnosis -- which may reflect aggressive disease and an advanced stage at onset of discovery, which leads to overall worse outcomes in a younger individual,\" he said.</p><p>And what about the risk for young obese men? According to Cao's team, one limitation of the study is that it included mostly white women, so more research is needed to see if these associations hold for men and other populations.</p><p>The report was published online Oct. 11 in the journal <i>JAMA Oncology</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more information on obesity and cancer, visit the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/diet-physical-activity/body-weight-and-cancer-risk/effects.html\" target=\"_new\"> American Cancer Society</a>.</p>",

But there are multiple social and psychological factors that also play a role in determining why some smokers who decide to quit are successful while others aren't.</p> <p> For women, weight gain is a common reason for relapse, said Dani, chair of the department of neuroscience at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.</p> <p> He advises women and men to substitute exercise for food when battling the cravings and nervous energy that often accompany nicotine withdrawal.</p> <p>\"Healthy habits like running or walking or doing yoga are great alternatives,\" Dani said. \"I know people who started walking the steps of their building at work instead of walking out to the parking lot to smoke a cigarette.\"</p> <p> Thomas Payne, director of ACT Center for Tobacco Treatment, Education and Research at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, said moments of extreme tension and strain often play a powerful role in why people return to smoking. </p> <p>\"Stress undermines our coping efforts and is often associated with more intense cravings,\" he said.</p> <p> Getting enough sleep each night is essential in reducing stress and increasing a person's chance of quitting for good, he said. Trying to reduce stress with a glass of wine or beer, on the other hand, could make the problem worse.</p> <p>\"Even small amounts of alcohol are associated with an increased risk of relapsing because it causes our inhibitions to drop off a little bit,\" said Payne, who's also an investigator with the American Heart Association Tobacco Regulation and Addiction Center.</p> <p> Studies show smokers have somewhat higher quitting success rates if they use interventions such as counseling; quit lines; nicotine replacement products such as gum, patches and lozenges; and prescription medications.</p> <p>\"Professional help can make all the difference in the world, and many insurance plans cover all or most of the costs involved,\" Payne said.</p> <p> The key, he said, is for people to keep using these programs and products even after they've stopped using tobacco.</p> <p>\"Think of it like antibiotics: You need to keep taking it even if you feel great,\" Payne said. \"A minimum of three months of usage is really what we're shooting for, and for many people, as long as six months may be the sweet spot.\"</p> <p> People who want to stay quit also shouldn't fall prey to the \"one won't hurt\" myth, Dani said.</p> <p>\"Just one often turns into one every couple of weeks, and then once a week, and pretty soon, they're smokers again,\" he said. \"It's similar to how people start smoking in the first place.\"</p> <p> Those who want to quit should also realize that setbacks are manageable.</p> <p>\"People can recover from a slip if they have a good mindset about it,\" Payne said. \"The important thing is not to beat yourself up about it. Think about it as a learning opportunity. Recognize what happened that made you want a cigarette so badly and plan for how you'll react in similar situations down the road.\"</p> <p> Every day, week and month a person goes without smoking, the better their chances of kicking nicotine addiction forever, experts say.</p> <p>\"There is never no risk of relapsing,\" Payne said. \"But the greatest risk period is the first two weeks after quitting. And once a person gets past the first three months or so, relapse risk drops considerably.\"</p>",

People who are socially engaged and healthy may rate their activities as more meaningful, while at the same time this sense of meaning may contribute to more engagement, better mental health, less loneliness and so on.\"</p><p>The bottom line, added Steptoe, is that \"it seems sensible to think about how to add worthwhile activities to our lives.\"</p><p>And what, exactly, is the definition of \"worthwhile\"? That's in the eye of the beholder, he said.</p><p>The participants in his study were simply asked to rate, on a scale of 1 to 10, the extent to which they felt their daily activities were worthwhile.</p><p>\"The things that bring meaning to people's lives are hugely variable,\" Steptoe said. \"It does not have to be a big project. For some people, things like hiking in the countryside, singing in a local choir, or looking after grandchildren will provide a strong sense of living a worthwhile life.\"</p><p>The findings were published online Jan. 7 in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>. They're based on about 7,300 adults, aged 50 to 90, in the United Kingdom.</p><p>The study participants answered surveys on their health and lifestyle, and underwent objective health tests that measured their cholesterol levels, walking speed and hand strength, among other things.</p><p>Overall, the more meaning people saw in their lives, the better their physical and mental health at the outset, and four years later. The odds of developing a new disease, depression, chronic pain or a disability dipped as \"worthwhile\" ratings rose, the researchers found.</p><p>Of course, people who are in good health, or have high incomes or more education, may be more likely to see their daily activities as worthwhile. But Steptoe said his team factored in those other key variables -- and there was still a connection between viewing life as meaningful and having better health four years later.</p><p>Plus, he noted, people with high ratings on the \"worthwhile\" scale were more likely to make positive lifestyle changes over those four years -- such as starting an exercise routine or eating more fruits and vegetables.</p><p>James Maddux is a senior scholar with the Center for the Advancement of Well-Being, at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va.</p><p> Maddux said he was not surprised by the findings, since they support connections seen in other studies: The more meaning people see in their lives, the healthier they tend to be.</p><p>Why would that be? Personality enters the picture here, he believes.</p><p>People who \"naturally see the good, even in little day-to-day things,\" are likely to take steps that support their physical and mental well-being -- from exercise to eating well to spending quality time with family and friends, Maddux said.</p><p>But even though personality has a large genetic component, that doesn't mean people with a less-sunny disposition are doomed. If you are grumping on the couch, \"the first step is to get off the couch,\" he said.</p><p>Think about what things in life are truly important to you, Maddux suggested -- whether it's family, friends, a creative activity, volunteering or getting involved in a political issue. And then choose those things over Netflix marathons.</p><p>\"Try to spend time, every day, doing something that reflects who you are,\" Maddux said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The University of California Berkeley Greater Good Science Center has advice on <a href=\"https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/key\" target=\"_new\">building well-being</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Oct. 15, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- A year after a concussion, up to one-third of kids still have symptoms such as headache and irritability that may affect school performance, a new study finds.</p><p>\"Children with all types of injuries may show post-concussion symptoms,\" said lead researcher Linda Ewing-Cobbs, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas Health Science Center Medical School in Houston.</p><p>Her team found as many as 31 percent still had symptoms that included inattention or fatigue 12 months after their head injury.</p><p>Girls who had mood problems beforehand and kids from poor or troubled families seem the most vulnerable, the researchers said. </p> <p>According to Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, \"This study is valuable because it demonstrates that our approach to post-concussive management should take into consideration prior psychological issues, gender, familial harmony, as well as income disparity.\" </p><p>Taking these factors into account might help identify children at higher risk for persistent symptoms, suggested Glatter, who was not involved with the new study. </p><p>Physical symptoms are usually seen soon after the head injury, Ewing-Cobbs said. Emotional and mental symptoms may become more noticeable several weeks later when children return to school and sports. </p><p>Although symptoms often disappear within a month, some children have prolonged difficulties that likely affect their school functioning, she explained. </p> <p>\"Children with symptoms that persist beyond a month should be monitored by their pediatrician so that they can be referred for any needed physical or psychological health services,\" Ewing-Cobbs added. </p><p>For the study, the researchers looked at nearly 350 children, aged 4 to 15, who suffered either a concussion or an orthopedic injury. Parents completed surveys that asked about their kids before the injury and general information about their home life.</p><p>The researchers then used a ratings scale to evaluate post-concussion recovery. </p><p>Although girls and boys had similar pre-concussion characteristics, girls had significantly more persistent symptoms than boys. They also had twice the odds of symptoms lasting one year after injury, the findings showed.</p><p>Family dynamics were also an important factor in children's recovery, the study authors noted. </p><p>\"Children from families that are supportive, communicative, and have access to a community network of supports tend to do better in a variety of areas, including recovering from a concussion, than children who do not have these assets,\" Ewing-Cobbs said.</p><p>How soon a child can return to school and sports after a concussion needs to be tailored to each child, Ewing-Cobbs suggested. \"There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of return-to-play in high-impact sports,\" she said.  </p><p>That decision should be based on collaboration between medical and school personnel and family, she added. </p><p>Each year, 1 million to 2 million children in the United States are treated for mild traumatic brain injury, which includes concussion from sports and other causes. </p><p> Glatter said this study suggests special accommodations may be needed when kids return to school in order to ensure that recovery continues. </p><p>\"This may include medications to manage headaches, regulate mood and anxiety, as well as cognitive behavioral therapy to help with adjustment and problem solving,\" he said. </p><p>Parents and teachers need to look out for any signs of depression or anxiety that could influence school performance and social integration, Glatter advised. </p><p>\"Trainers, coaches, school administrators and parents need to be invested and aware of the gender-associated medical, family and social issues that play a role in post-concussion recovery,\" he said.</p><p>The report was published online Oct. 15 in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>To learn more about concussion, visit the <a href=\"https://www.aans.org/Patients/Neurosurgical-Conditions-and-Treatments/Concussion\" target=\"_new\"> American Association of Neurological Surgeons</a>.</p>",

In fact, there was a decline in the percentage who said they'd ever had sex: from almost 21 percent in 2008, to about 18 percent in 2013.</p><p>And when girls did have sex, they were more likely to use condoms and birth control in more recent years, the findings showed.</p><p>The findings align with smaller studies from the United States and Europe, said Ogilvie, a professor at the University of British Columbia's School of Population and Public Health.</p><p>\"This study gives us more evidence HPV vaccination is not causing kids to make poorer choices in their sexual behavior,\" she said.</p><p>Dr. Ina Park, an advisor to the American Sexual Health Association, agreed. She said she hopes the findings reassure parents who have lingering worries.</p><p>\"Any fears that HPV vaccination would lead to increased sexual risk-taking should finally be put to rest,\" said Park, who is also an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine.</p><p>\"We should continue to encourage HPV vaccination for all preteen girls and boys,\" she said.</p><p>The findings are based on nearly 300,000 girls who took part in a periodic health survey of British Columbia teenagers. The girls were 15 years old, on average. </p><p>Of girls surveyed in 2003, 21 percent said they'd ever had sex. That figure was similar in 2008, the year the HPV vaccine program began. But by 2013, only about 18 percent of girls said they'd ever had sex. </p><p>There were also signs that more girls were delaying sex in recent years. Among those who were sexually active, the percentage who'd had sex before age 14 dipped by one-quarter.</p><p>Meanwhile, more girls in 2013 said they'd used condoms or birth control pills.</p><p>\"Their sexual health choices actually got better,\" Ogilvie said. She noted that there could be various reasons for that, and no one is saying the HPV vaccine program deserves the credit.</p><p>Some parents, Ogilvie said, might wonder why their 11-year-old needs a vaccine against a sexually transmitted disease.</p><p>\"But that's exactly when we want to get them -- before they start having sex and are exposed to HPV,\" Ogilvie said. \"This is about prevention.\"</p><p>And ultimately, she added, it's about preventing cancer.</p><p>\"This is really a vaccine against cancer,\" Ogilvie said. \"And it's exciting that we have a cancer vaccine.\"</p><p>The study was published Oct. 15 in <i>CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal)</i>.

      "Body__c": "<!--Spanish ID: 739860 --><p>TUESDAY, Nov. 20, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- As the U.S. opioid epidemic rages unchecked, new research shows that pregnancy-related deaths due to opioid misuse more than doubled between 2007 and 2016.</p><p>Deaths during or soon after pregnancy rose 34 percent during that time, and the percentage involving heroin, fentanyl or prescription painkillers (such as OxyContin) jumped from 4 percent to 10 percent, the researchers said. </p><p>The findings \"largely confirmed our suspicions,\" said study lead author Alison Gemmill, of Stony Brook University in New York. </p><p>\"We know that opioid-related mortality has increased among all reproductive-aged women,\" Gemmill said. It's also known that the number of babies suffering from neonatal abstinence syndrome -- because of opioid use during pregnancy -- has increased dramatically in recent years, she added.</p><p>\"Our research points to yet another spill-over effect of these broader trends of the opioid crisis,\" added Gemmill, an assistant professor of family, population and preventive medicine.</p><p>The analysis looked at the U.S. National Vital Statistics System's death certificate data for women aged 15 to 49. The researchers focused on deaths across 22 states and Washington, D.C., that occurred during pregnancy and up to one year post-pregnancy.</p><p>The study team found that even though white women are less likely to die from any cause while pregnant, they are more likely than blacks or Hispanics to die because of opioids.</p><p>\"We think this is because what we're seeing mirrors broader race-specific trends of the epidemic,\" said Gemmill.</p><p>She pointed to research conducted by her co-authors that found that between the mid-1990s and 2010, \"the opioid epidemic expanded quickly within the white population, while opioid mortality remained stable in the black population.\"</p><p>The vast majority of opioid-related deaths in the study group (70 percent) occurred either during pregnancy or within 42 days after terminating a pregnancy, according to the new report.</p><p>Also, the underlying class of drugs implicated in a pregnant woman's death shifted over the decade, with fewer fatalities involving methadone.</p><p>By 2016, nearly 80 percent of these deaths involved either heroin or a synthetic opioid such as fentanyl. This figure was less than 20 percent in 2007, the study authors said.</p><p>Exactly how these women died -- whether it was due to overdosing, for instance -- remained outside the scope of the study.</p><p>But because pregnancy typically entails frequent contact between a woman and her health care providers, Gemmill suggested that clinicians have a great opportunity to intervene in the face of drug abuse.</p><p>She also noted that a substantial proportion of women die from opioid use more than six weeks after giving birth. This \"underlines the need for specialized strategies that address the complex needs women face after giving birth,\" she said.</p><p>\"This is a difficult task,\" Gemmill acknowledged, \"given that many women do not even attend their recommended postpartum checkup.\"</p><p>Dr. Maria Small is an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C.</p><p>\"The problem needs a policy-based and medical-based solution,\" said Small.</p><p>Any response to the growing risk will need to go beyond simply addressing each woman's immediate medical and emergency needs, she suggested. It will also require clinicians \"with knowledge of how to treat opioid and other substance toxicities,\" Small said.</p><p>Also needed are treatment programs that enlist loved ones and the community at large, Small added.</p><p>The findings were published online recently in the <i>American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on pregnancy and opioid use at the <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/women-drugs/pregnant-concerned-about-opioid-use#videos/\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Oct. 19, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The latest national tally on dieting finds that nearly half of U.S. adults are doing what they can to trim a widening waistline.</p><p>Overall, 49.3 percent of people aged 20 and older said they'd tried to lose weight over the past 12 months, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The findings were based on a 2015-2016 national health survey, the latest data available.</p><p>The new stats reflect a significant increase from prior surveys. For example, 43 percent of American adults were trying to slim down in 2007-2008, but the numbers have crept steadily upwards every year since, the CDC said.</p><p>Attempts at weight loss were higher for women than men in the latest survey (56.3 percent and 42.2 percent, respectively), but over time rates of increase have been steady for both genders.</p><p>Why are more Americans than ever concerned about overweight and obesity? Registered dietitian Stephanie Schiff cites multiple reasons.</p><p>First off, \"we are more sedentary than ever before,\" said Schiff, who guides the nutrition program at Northwell Health's Huntington Hospital, in Huntington, N.Y. \"Our entertainment is more likely to occur while we are sitting -- in front of the TV, in front of a computer, in bed with our phones in our hands.\"</p><p>Next, \"we're not cooking our own food as much, we're eating out more,\" she said. \"And when we don't have a hand in our own meals, we don't have control over what goes into it -- others do. And they add more fat, more sugar, more salt.\"</p><p>Increasing stress levels can also \"play havoc with our metabolisms,\" Schiff said, and that can prompt people to overeat. Sleeplessness is another known risk factor for poor eating, she added.</p><p>So what works to get slim and keep the weight from coming back?  Sharon Zarabi is a registered dietitian who leads the bariatric program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p>  <p>She believes the key is to incorporate healthy living habits that last a lifetime -- not just a fast fix.</p><p>\"I try to avoid using the word 'diet,' as it is something you manage for a short period of time based on food intake,\" she said. Instead, Zarabi said, she would \"encourage more healthy living, which focuses on incorporating rituals to define a new sense of optimal well-being to feel good for life.\"</p><p>\"You follow a diet when you want to lose weight -- and then what?,\" she said. \"Lifestyle is what keeps the weight off, and that comes through our behavior.\"</p><p>Schiff agreed. She noted that even the faddiest, \"odd\" diets can work to drop pounds, but then those pounds come creeping back.</p><p>\"Because eating only 500 calories a day may not be sustainable, or eating only certain foods for your blood type,\" she explained.</p><p>The real solution is finding \"a way of eating that is natural and has you feeling satisfied\" over the long term, Schiff said. That means including foods you actually enjoy.</p><p>Sticking to plant-based foods and avoiding refined sugars, refined flour and chemically processed foods works best, Schiff said.</p><p>\"Sometimes it also means changing your environment -- getting rid of problem foods in your house, the foods you have no control over, or that you eat just because they're there,\" she said.</p><p>The bottom line, she said, is to \"make changes that you know you can live with for the rest of your life.\"</p><p>And don't forget exercise. Exercise can help boost weight loss, but more importantly it's a way of \"keeping your body finely tuned and healthy and strong,\" Schiff said.  And with exercise -- especially resistance exercise -- if weight does come back, it will return as healthy muscle, not fat, she said.</p><p>The new stats on weight loss were published Oct. 18 in the CDC journal <i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There;'s more on maintaining a healthy weight at the <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute</a>.</p>",

She is a surgical resident and research fellow at Michigan Medicine.</p><p>\"This is not a phenomenon of a few outlier surgeons -- it was seen across the state, and across many operations,\" Vu noted in a university news release.</p><p>In the study, the researchers analyzed data from nearly 2,400 patients who had one of 12 common types of surgery at 33 hospitals in Michigan. On average, patients took only 27 percent of the opioids (such as OxyContin) prescribed to them. However,  for every 10 additional pills prescribed, patients took five of them.</p><p>The median number of pills prescribed was 30 and the median number used was nine, the researchers found.</p><p>Patients who had a hernia repair operation -- either open or minimally invasive surgery -- took the most opioids, while those who had their appendix or thyroid taken out took the least, the findings showed.</p><p>But the size of the opioid prescription was a more important factor in how many pills a patient took than their pain scores, the intensity of their operation and personal factors, the study authors said.</p><p>According to study first author Dr. Ryan Howard, \"In what we tell patients about what kind of pain to expect after surgery, and how many pills we give, we set their expectations -- and what the patient expects plays a huge role in their post-operative pain experience. So if they get 60 pain pills, they think they have to take many of them.\" </p><p>Howard, a surgical resident with Michigan Medicine, added, \"We hope that by shining a spotlight on the difference between prescription size and actual use, we can empower surgeons to change their prescribing habits, and be a better steward to both their patient and the broader community.\" </p><p>The report was published Nov. 7 in the journal <i>JAMA Surgery</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse has more about <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/prescription-opioids\" target=\"_new\">prescription opioids</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Oct. 19, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- There's growing evidence that the herpes virus responsible for cold sores also may cause Alzheimer's disease, a new research paper contends.</p><p>It's been long known that herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) can been found in the brains of elderly people with Alzheimer's disease, and research has shown that herpes increases Alzheimer's risk in people genetically predisposed to dementia, said researcher Ruth Itzhaki.</p><p>Newer data suggest that treating people with antiviral drugs might actually protect them from dementia, said Itzhaki, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Manchester in England.</p><p>\"We found that the antiherpes antiviral drug acyclovir blocks HSV1 DNA replication, and reduces levels of beta amyloid and of P-tau caused by HSV1 infection of cell cultures,\" Itzhaki said. Beta amyloid plaques and tangles of tau proteins are two of the hallmarks found in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.</p><p>But the effect that herpes may have on the brain is not yet fully understood, and it's unlikely that the virus alone can explain all cases of Alzheimer's, said James Hendrix, director of global science initiatives for the Alzheimer's Association.</p><p>Hendrix noted that half of all adults carry the herpes simplex 1 virus.</p><p>\"We know that 50 percent of the population isn't getting Alzheimer's disease, so it's not a 1-to-1 correlation,\" Hendrix said. \"If we took the recommendation of the author of this paper and gave everybody over the age of 55 antiviral drugs, I don't think we would wipe out Alzheimer's disease. We might lower it somewhat, but I don't think we would eliminate Alzheimer's disease.\"</p><p>Herpes simplex virus 1 infects most humans in infancy, and remains dormant within the peripheral nervous system from then on, Itzhaki said. Stress can cause the virus to reactivate and, in some people, cause cold sores.</p><p>Itzhaki and her colleagues believe that herpes contributes to Alzheimer's disease by migrating into the brains of elderly people as their immune system naturally declines.</p><p>Once it has infected the brain, Itzhaki argues, HSV1 causes damage and inflammation in brain cells whenever it's reactivated by events such as stress, immune suppression or infection by other microbes.</p><p>This damage is particularly bad in people with the APOE4 gene, which has been directly linked to Alzheimer's disease, she said.</p><p>\"The likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease is 12 times greater for APOE4 carriers who have HSV1 [the herpes virus] in the brain than for those with neither factor,\" Itzhaki said.</p><p>\"We suggest that repeated activation causes cumulative damage, leading eventually to Alzheimer's disease in people with an APOE4 allele,\" Itzhaki continued. \"Presumably, in APOE4 carriers, Alzheimer's disease develops in the brain because of greater HSV1-induced formation of toxic products, or lesser repair of damage.\"</p><p>Dr. Sam Gandy is associate director of the Mount Sinai Alzheimer's Disease Research Center in New York City. He said there's evidence that viruses can have an effect on other diseases of the brain and nervous system, in particular Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).</p><p>\"Probably the best evidence that viruses can contribute to major brain illnesses comes from ALS, where they found not a herpes virus but a retrovirus,\" Gandy said. \"The peptides of the virus appeared in the spinal fluid of patients with ALS, and when they treated those patients with antiretrovirals, they seemed to clinically stabilize.\"</p><p>Itzhaki said a newer study out of Taiwan seems to indicate that ridding the body of herpes through antiviral drugs could reduce Alzheimer's risk.</p><p>The Taiwan results showed that the risk of dementia was much greater in people infected with herpes, and that treatment with antivirals caused a dramatic decrease in the number of people severely infected by HSV1 who went on to later develop dementia, Itzhaki said.</p><p>However, Hendrix said, the Taiwanese results can be explained in other ways. For example, it might not be the antiviral drugs that reduced the rates of dementia, but the fact that those specific patients were receiving better medical treatment overall.</p><p>\"We know that better quality health care leads to lower rates of dementia,\" Hendrix said.</p><p>Gandy said that, while the link between herpes and Alzheimer's is promising, clinical trials would be needed to show that antiviral treatment can effectively head off dementia in people.</p><p>\"There's lots of circumstantial evidence. The definitive proof requires finding living people who have the virus and symptoms of dementia, giving them the antiviral, and showing that their symptoms stabilize or improve,\" Gandy said.</p><p>New research tools will be needed, including a brain scan that can specifically detect herpes in the brain, he added.</p><p>\"We have to be able to find the virus as a warning flag, to tell us to initiate the treatment, and then see whether that has an impact on the progression,\" Gandy said.</p><p>The new paper was published online Oct. 19 in the journal <i>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The World Health Organization has more about <a href=\" http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/herpes-simplex-virus#hsv1 \" target=\"_new\">herpes simplex virus 1</a>.</p>",

In a study of 12 dogs, the investigators say they've dug up some new details about how pooches process words.</p><p>\"Many dog owners think that their dogs know what some words mean, but there really isn't much scientific evidence to support that,\" said study first author Ashley Prichard, a Ph.D. candidate in psychology. \"We wanted to get data from the dogs themselves -- not just owner reports.\"</p><p>The study included various breeds. The dogs were trained for months by their owners to retrieve two different objects when told the objects' names -- \"Monkey\" and \"Piggy.\" One was a soft toy, the other a hard one.</p><p>The dogs underwent brain scans while their owners first presented the toys and said the toys' names. The owners then held up new objects and said nonsense words.</p><p>The dogs showed greater activation in the sound-processing (auditory) regions of the brain in response to the new nonsense words than to the words they were trained to recognize, the researchers found.</p><p>\"We expected to see that dogs neurally discriminate between words that they know and words that they don't,\" Prichard said in a university news release.</p><p>\"What's surprising is that the result is opposite to that of research on humans -- people typically show greater neural activation for known words than novel words,\" she noted. </p><p>The dogs may show greater brain activity in response to a new word because they sense their owners want them to understand what they are saying, and they are trying to do so, the researchers suggested.</p><p>\"Dogs ultimately want to please their owners, and perhaps also receive praise or food,\" said study senior author and neuroscientist Gregory Berns. </p><p>The findings suggest that dogs have at least a basic ability to recognize words they've been taught, and to distinguish between words they've heard before and those they haven't, according to the researchers.</p><p>\"We know that dogs have the capacity to process at least some aspects of human language since they can learn to follow verbal commands,\" Berns said. \"Previous research, however, suggests dogs may rely on many other cues to follow a verbal command, such as gaze, gestures and even emotional expressions from their owners.\"</p><p>The study was published Oct. 15 in the journal <i>Frontiers of Neuroscience</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The National Canine Research Organization has more on the <a href=\"https://www.nationalcanineresearchcouncil.com/news/are-you-happy-disgusted-your-dog-can-tell-difference\" target=\"_new\">human-dog connection</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Oct. 23, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration \"jumped the gun\" when it declared the chemical BPA safe for consumers earlier this year, experts from the Endocrine Society claimed Tuesday.</p><p>The FDA asserted in February that its \"initial review supports our determination that currently authorized uses of BPA continue to be safe for consumers.\"</p><p>But the FDA made that statement without reviewing pending evidence from ongoing studies being conducted outside the agency, said Heather Patisaul, a professor with North Carolina State University's department of biological sciences.</p><p>Further, the agency even shrugged off its own data showing that low levels of BPA could increase risk of breast and prostate cancer, said Laura Vandenberg, an associate professor with the University of Massachusetts Amherst School of Public Health and Health Sciences.</p><p>\"There are serious effects that were observed in the FDA core study, even in the groups that were exposed only to low doses of BPA,\" Vandenberg said. \"Unfortunately, these effects seem to be dismissed by the FDA, often because they aren't observed at high doses.\"</p><p>The FDA did not respond to a request from <i>HealthDay</i> for comment.</p><p>The FDA study had been designed as a groundbreaking collaboration between federal regulators and academic scientists.</p><p>In the study, researchers force-fed BPA to lab rats at varying doses and for varied amounts of time, out to two years.</p><p>The effort was aimed at clearing up safety concerns regarding BPA, a chemical used to make plastic containers and the lining of food cans. BPA mimics the hormone estrogen in the body, and has been linked to reproductive, behavior and metabolic disorders, Vandenberg said.</p><p>But the final report, which integrates the FDA data with results from academic studies, won't be released until fall of 2019, said Patisaul. She is one of the academic researchers involved in the final report. Some of the academic studies are still undergoing peer review.</p><p>Despite this, the FDA issued a statement months ago based solely on its own data, which it referred to as \"an important step for this consortium.\"</p><p>But, Patisaul explained, \"Now we're in the very critical phase where we have to take all of that information, put all of that data together, and come up with a conclusion for how BPA impacts our bodies. That will involve not only the FDA's core study data, but all of the data from the independent investigators.\"</p><p>So, she added, \"that's why there has been concern from the Endocrine Study and others that FDA is jumping the gun a little bit in its conclusion that BPA in food packaging is safe, because the data has not yet been integrated.\"</p><p>The FDA statement did note that the integrated report would be released in the future, but Patisaul said that by issuing the statement, the agency had essentially established a firm position in favor of BPA's safety.</p><p>\"The FDA has put a stake in the ground. They have said BPA is safe. And they are very reluctant to back away from that stake, because doing so requires them to admit, essentially capitulate, that they got it wrong the first time,\" Patisaul said.</p><p>However, even within the FDA's own data there's reason to doubt BPA's safety, Vandenberg said.</p><p>The FDA data shows that at low doses, BPA increased the incidence of breast cancer, prostate inflammation and kidney disease in lab rats, she explained.</p><p>For example, more than 20 percent of rats exposed to a low dose of BPA developed breast cancer, and about 45 percent had increased prostate inflammation at a similarly low dose, according to Vandenberg.</p><p>The FDA might have disregarded these findings because there wasn't a clear dose-response relationship, in that the health risk from BPA failed to increase with the level of the dose, she noted.</p><p>But substances that affect the hormone system often only show effects at low doses (where the body mistakes the substance for an actual hormone) and high doses (where levels become toxic), she said.</p><p>\"The reality is not a linear relationship between dose and effect, but a U-shaped relationship,\" Vandenberg explained.</p><p> Patisaul said that consumers worried about BPA safety can protect themselves by using less plastic, instead storing food in glass containers. They also can avoid handling thermal paper receipts or microwaving food in plastic containers.</p><p>\"If you're really worried you can avoid canned foods, particularly things like tomatoes that are acidic and react with the lining,\" Patisaul suggested.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Mayo Clinic has more about <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/bpa/faq-20058331\" target=\"_new\">BPA</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Oct. 25, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- You can get your hands on pumpkin seeds on about any store's snack aisle, but your healthiest option may be the old-fashioned way: scooping them out of the stringy guts of that jack-o'-lantern you're carving.</p> <p>That's because store-bought pumpkin seeds -- ever more popular because they're easy to eat and loaded with nutrients -- may be loaded with salt as well. But when they come straight from the source, pumpkin seeds are lower in sodium and have more of the minerals that make them so nutritious, said Judith Wylie-Rosett, a professor and division head for health promotion and nutrition research at New York's Albert Einstein College of Medicine. </p> <p>Of course, buying whole pumpkins for the seeds isn't exactly economical or practical. But you can and should find the unsalted variety, Wylie-Rosett said. </p> <p>\"We think of savory foods as having that salty flavor,\" she said. \"We're very acculturated to that. If we eat less salt, then we crave less salt, but that takes a lot of work for some people.\"</p> <p>Pumpkin seeds, also known as pepitas, can be consumed with or without their shells. Once you've scooped them out of the pumpkin, it's advisable to soak them in water for a few hours to help remove the pulp from the shells. (There's nothing wrong with consuming the fleshy bits that are attached to the shells, but many don't care for the texture.) A common practice is to add light spices and roast the seeds on a cookie sheet on the top rack of the oven for 15 to 20 minutes at 350 degrees.</p> <p>Eating the shells only adds to the seeds' high fiber content, which has been associated with a reduced risk of heart disease and obesity. Whole, roasted pumpkin seeds in their shells contain about 5.2 grams of fiber per serving, while shelled seeds contain just 1.8 grams.</p> <p>\"There is one caveat to the fiber, though,\" Wylie-Rosett said. \"If somebody has not been eating very much fiber at all, and they then eat a large quantity of pumpkin seeds  they may end up with some digestive-tract disturbance.\"</p> <p>Pumpkin seeds also are rich in other nutrients, including magnesium, which can aid in heart and bone health, lower blood pressure and even prevent migraines. Just a quarter cup of pumpkin seeds includes 42 percent of a person's recommended daily intake of magnesium, a potentially easy solution for almost half of Americans who don't get enough magnesium in their diets.</p> <p>\"As a mineral, magnesium actually helps with a lot of the somatic (bodily) functions of the body,\" Wylie-Rosett said. \"Historically we ate a lot more magnesium, but as we have processed food, it is processed out and may not be replaced that much.\" </p> <p>Other benefits of pumpkin seeds include:</p> <ul> <li> A serving of seeds contains about 6.6 mg of zinc, which accounts for almost half the recommended daily intake. Zinc is important in the diet because it's an antioxidant and an anti-inflammatory agent that also helps the metabolic process. </li> <li>They're a natural source of tryptophan, which can help promote sleep.</li> <li> They have been linked to a reduced risk of some types of cancer, including breast and prostate cancers.</li> <li> Studies have shown that pumpkin seed oil may reduce cholesterol and high blood pressure. </li> <li> Studies also have shown that seeds can reduce blood sugar, which is important for people who have diabetes.</li> </ul> <p>One cautionary note: Pumpkin-spiced everything during the autumn months is not necessarily recommended.</p> <p>Pumpkin spice itself contains just a couple of calories per serving, but it often shows up with foods and drinks that are not so healthy. </p> <p>\"People come up with methods of overdoing it that I never could think of,\" Wylie-Rosett said. \"So often we don't eat pumpkin as a vegetable. We eat it as an ingredient in a dessert. We treat it as a seasonal item.\"</p> <p>Two healthy options for eating pumpkin no matter the season are pumpkin stew and roasted pumpkin, she said. Recipes for those dishes offer a way to consume the flesh of the pumpkin, which is high in carotenoids and fiber and low in fat. </p>",
