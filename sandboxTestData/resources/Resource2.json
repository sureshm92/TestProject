      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 10, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- While therapy dogs can help ease anxiety for kids with cancer, they may also carry antibiotic-resistant bacteria that can put patients at risk for serious infections.</p><p>Cleaning the dogs with antibacterial shampoo and wipes reduces that risk, according to researchers. </p><p>The new study included therapy dogs that visit kids receiving outpatient cancer treatment at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Children's Hospital in Baltimore. The dogs do several one-on-one and group visits each day, often going to different departments or other hospitals.</p><p>\"It's amazing to watch just how excited the children get when they see the dogs for the first time, and they enjoy petting, hugging, kissing and playing fetch with them. The visits are really helpful in easing their anxiety and stress,\" said study author Kathryn Dalton. </p><p>\"But because they go from session to session, the dogs can pick up and spread MRSA (methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>),\" Dalton added. She's a doctoral candidate in the department of environmental health and engineering at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health.</p><p>MRSA can cause a staph infection that is resistant to many common antibiotics. The risk is higher for people whose immune systems are weakened, such as cancer patients. </p><p>The research team found that shampooing the dogs with the antibiotic chlorhexidine before their first visit of the day and using chlorhexidine wipes every five to 10 minutes during visits reduced the risk that the dogs would pick up and spread MRSA to the patients. </p><p>The study was presented Oct. 5, in San Francisco, at ID Week, a joint meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, the HIV Medicine Association and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society.</p><p>\"This simple, low-cost intervention helps increase patient safety while still ensuring that young patients with cancer can benefit from these therapy dogs,\" Dalton said in a meeting news release.</p><p>The study included 45 cancer patients, aged 2 to 20, and four therapy dogs. After seven sessions in which the dogs were not treated with chlorhexidine, four patients (15 percent) became MRSA carriers, as did three dogs (43 percent).</p><p>In six sessions in which chlorhexidine was used on the dogs, one patient (4.5 percent) became a MRSA carrier, as did two dogs (33 percent), the findings showed.</p><p>When the dogs weren't treated with the antibiotic, patients who had close interactions with them (petting, hugging, brushing their fur and spending more time) were six times more likely to become MRSA carriers than those who didn't, the study found.</p><p>But chlorhexidine eliminated that difference, the researchers reported.</p><p>Research presented at medical meetings should be considered preliminary until it has been published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mrsa/index.html\" target=\"_new\">MRSA</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Dec. 18, 2018 (HealthDay News)  -- The California farm where romaine lettuce was implicated in the recent nationwide E. coli outbreak said it is expanding its recall to include other forms of produce.</p><p>According to a company statement, Adam Bros. Farming Inc., in Santa Barbara County, said it is also recalling red and green leaf lettuce as well as cauliflower.</p><p>The company said it did so, \"after it was discovered that sediment from a reservoir near where the produce was grown tested positive for E. coli O157:H7,\" the strain implicated in the outbreak.</p><p>As well, \"the Adam Bros. recall has prompted asub-recall by Spokane Produce Inc., of Spokane, Wash.,\" the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in its own news release issued late Monday.</p><p>Spokane Produce \"recalled sandwiches and other products under the Northwest Cuisine Creations and Fresh&amp;Local labels,\" the FDA said.</p><p>Federal health investigators announced on Dec. 13 that they had pinpointed Adam Bros. as at least one California farm implicated in the recent outbreak of E. coli illness tied to romaine lettuce. They said that more farms in the same area are probably connected to the outbreak.</p><p>So far, 59 people across 15 states have come down with the often severe gastrointestinal illness. Health concerns were so high that just before Thanksgiving, the FDA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked Americans to temporarily stop consuming all romaine lettuce  while they investigated the source of the outbreak.</p><p>That investigation has now pinpointed Adam Bros. as a source, experts at the FDA and CDC have said.</p><p>\"One of the samples tested by the CDC was positive for the outbreak strain by genetic fingerprinting, and was found in the sediment of an agricultural water reservoir at one ranch that is owned and operated by Adam Brothers Farming in Santa Barbara County, Calif.,\" said Dr. Stephen Ostroff, senior advisor to the FDA Commissioner.</p><p>He said the farm was cooperating with the investigation. The farm hasn't shipped romaine lettuce since Nov. 20, and Ostroff said the farm is \"committed to recalling products that may have come into contact with water from the agricultural water reservoir.\"</p><p>That said, other farms in the area might still be  implicated, so \"people should still pay close attention to where their lettuce is from,\" he added.</p><p>Because of this and other recent outbreaks, romaine lettuce now sold in the United States has labeling indicating the place and date of harvest. If heads of romaine are sold loose, without affixed labels, retailers are being asked to post a notice showing place and date of harvest near the store register.</p><p>Most romaine sold in the United States is safe to eat. Right now, precautions are limited to romaine lettuce from just a few California counties, the FDA said.</p><p>\"We continue to advise avoiding romaine lettuce from Monterey, San Benito and Santa Barbara counties in California,\" Ostroff said.</p><p>Hydroponically- and greenhouse-grown romaine also does not appear to be related to the current outbreak.</p><p>Illnesses from the E. coli O157:H7 strain implicated in this outbreak have sometimes been  severe. Although no deaths have been reported, there have 23 hospitalizations and 2 cases of kidney failure, health officials said.</p><p>\"The E. coli strain isolated from ill people in the current romaine lettuce outbreak is also closely related to the E. coli strain isolated from people in a 2017 outbreak linked to leafy green in the United States and romaine lettuce in Canada,\" noted FDA Deputy Commissioner Frank Yiannas.</p><p>So who's most at risk from E. coli?</p><p>Dr. Robert Glatter is an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City who's seen the effects of infection with the gastrointestinal bug firsthand. It's not a minor ailment, he said.</p><p>\"In general, symptoms of E. coli infection generally begin about three to four days after consuming the bacteria, and may include abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and watery or bloody diarrhea, along with fever,\" Glatter said.</p><p>And while healthy people who battle a bout of E. coli typically recover within five to seven days, the illness can be more protracted -- and even deadly -- for people already made vulnerable by chronic disease or advanced age.</p><p>\"People with diabetes, kidney disease or those with cancer or autoimmune disease run the risk of a more severe illness,\" Glatter explained.</p><p>The particular strain of E. coli detected in the current lettuce outbreak -- E. coli O157:H7 -- is particularly nasty, he noted.</p><p>\"Most strains of E. coli do not actually cause diarrhea, but E. coli O157 produces a powerful toxin that injures the inner lining of the small intestine, leading to bloody diarrhea,\" Glatter said. Even a tiny amount of ingested bacteria could spur this type of illness.</p><p>\"It can make people much more ill, and may lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure, in some cases,\" he said.</p><p>In many cases, antibiotics are used to help beat back an E. coli infection, but these drugs can affect the kidneys, Glatter noted.</p><p>\"Antibiotics may be necessary in certain cases, so it's important to see your doctor if you have continued and severe symptoms such as fever, bloody diarrhea, and you are not able to eat or drink,\" he said.</p><p>However, in the case of E. coli O157:H7, \"taking antibiotics may actually increase your risk of developing kidney failure, so it's important to speak with your health care provider if you should develop severe symptoms,\" Glatter advised.</p><p>And if you do think you might be sick with E. coli, or any other foodborne illness, make sure you don't spread it to those near you.</p><p>The bacterium \"can be transmitted person-to-person, so it's vital that anyone who is potentially infected wash their hands thoroughly and not share utensils, cups or glasses,\" Glatter said. \"This also goes for bath towels. Linens also need to be washed in hot water and treated with bleach.\"</p><p>He noted that \"ground beef, unpasteurized milk, fresh produce and contaminated water are common sources of E. coli bacteria.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Find out more about E. coli illness at the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/ecoli-symptoms.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

If you prefer a live tree, choose one with fresh, green needles that don't break easily. Water trees often to ensure they don't dry out.</p><p>Avoid using candles, but if you do, keep them at least 12 inches from anything flammable and 3 feet from your live Christmas tree, the fire administration advises.</p><p>When cooking, keep anything that can catch on fire -- such as pot holders, wooden utensils, paper or plastic bags, food packaging and towels  -- away from stove tops and ovens, safety experts say.</p><p>Also, always keep an eye on things in the kitchen. Unattended cooking is the leading cause of kitchen fires, according to the National Fire Protection Association.</p><p>\"If you're sleepy or have consumed alcohol, don't use the stove or stovetop,\" Emmons said. \"Plus, always stay in the kitchen when you're cooking food; if you leave the kitchen at all, be sure to turn off the stove and move anything that can catch fire away from it.\"</p><p>Space heaters are another potential fire hazard. They're involved in nearly 80 percent of fatal home fires, according to the association.</p><p>Nearly half of all space heater fires involve electric space heaters. Be sure electric heaters have automatic shut-off tip-over protection, and always plug them directly into a wall outlet, rather than an extension cord. Unplug them when you leave a room or go to sleep.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Fire Administration has more on <a href=\"https://www.usfa.fema.gov/prevention/outreach/holiday.html\" target=\"_new\">holiday fire safety</a>.</p>",

Here we showed that this may be true in humans, too,\" said study author Lorenzo Fabrizi of University College London.</p><p>His team measured the brain waves of 19 newborns during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The babies were an average of 2 days old, and some were premature. The researchers found a link between movement and brain activity.</p><p>For example, movement of a newborn's right hand causes immediate activity in the left part of the brain that processes touch for the right hand. The size of these \"fast brain waves\" is largest in premature babies, who would normally still be in the womb, the researchers said.</p><p>The fast brain waves associated with movement end by the time a baby is a few weeks old, the researchers added.</p><p>These findings suggest that fetal movement in the third trimester of pregnancy helps to develop areas of the brain that process sensory input. This is how a baby develops a sense of its own body, according to the study authors.</p><p>The research could improve care for premature infants, Fabrizi and his colleagues said in a university news release.</p><p>\"We think the findings have implications for providing the optimal hospital environment for infants born early, so that they receive appropriate sensory input,\" said study co-author Kimberley Whitehead. She's in the university's department of neuroscience, physiology and pharmacology.</p><p>For example, it's already routine for infants to be \"nested\" in their bassinets. This allows them to \"feel\" a surface when they kick their limbs, as if they were still inside the womb, Whitehead noted.</p><p>\"As the movements we observed occur during sleep, our results support other studies which indicate that sleep should be protected in newborns, for example by minimizing the disturbance associated with necessary medical procedures,\" Whitehead said.</p><p>The findings were published Nov. 30 in the journal <i>Scientific Reports</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Pregnancy Association has more on <a href=\"http://americanpregnancy.org/while-pregnant/first-fetal-movement/\" target=\"_new\">fetal movement</a>.</p>",

From that point forward, the Bushes became strongly identified with the Lone Star state.</p><p>Bush's nearly 40 years of public service began in 1963, when, alarmed by a potential far right takeover of local Republican politics, he ran for and won the leadership of the Harris County Republican committee.  He eventually made his way to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1966, representing a wealthy district in Houston.</p><p>By the early 1970s Bush was a fixture in the Nixon White House, becoming ambassador to the United Nations in 1971. He then headed the Republican National Committee during perhaps one of the GOP's most trying times: Watergate and its aftermath.</p><p>During the Gerald Ford presidency, Bush was picked to head the CIA. His political career had a lull during President Jimmy Carter's term, but Bush again rose to national prominence as President Ronald Reagan's two-term vice president during the 1980s.</p><p>By the end of Reagan's tenure, Bush was ready to take a long-sought shot at the Presidency: he beat Democrat Michael Dukakis and installed Indiana senator Dan Quayle as his vice president.</p> <p>Bush's presidential term is perhaps best remembered for the first Gulf War, sparked by an invasion of oil-rich Kuwait by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. \"Vital issues of principle are at stake,\"Bush told Congress on Sept. 11, 1990. \"Saddam Hussein is literally trying to wipe a country off the face of the earth.\"</p><p>Backed by a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing force if Iraq did not withdraw, as well as bipartisan support in Congress, Bush ordered American forces to bomb Baghdad on Jan. 16, 1991. \"Our goal is not the conquest of Iraq, it is the liberation of Kuwait,\"Bush told the nation in a televised address.</p><p>The ground war was short - 100 hours - and the Iraqi army fled, with Hussein remaining in power.\"We were disappointed [at leaving Hussein in place], but I still do not regret my decision to end the war when we did,\" Bush said.</p><p>Bush weathered other political storms, such as turmoil in the former Soviet Union and the much-contested appointment of U.S. Supreme Court judge Clarence Thomas. By 1992, with the economy in a downturn, and a charismatic Democratic opponent, Bill Clinton, in the ascendant, Bush failed to win a second term.</p><p>But the Bush family's political fortunes rebounded with the election to the Presidency in 2000 -- and the then again in 2004 -- of Bush's namesake, George Walker Bush Jr.</p><p>Near the end of his own presidency, George H.W. Bush made a diary entry in which he conceded he was perhaps not a trailblazer in the Oval Office, but a president who held firm in trying times.</p><p>\"I'm certainly not seen as visionary,\" Bush wrote. \"But I hope I'm seen as steady and prudent and able.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on the 41st President at  <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/george-h-w-bush/\" target=\"new\">whitehouse.gov</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<!--Spanish ID: 740237 --><p>SUNDAY, Dec. 2, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The risk of sudden unexpected death in people with epilepsy can change over time, and it usually changes for the better, a new study reports. </p><p>In what the researchers are calling hopeful news, the study found that people who have a medium or high risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) often don't remain at the same risk level. </p><p>\"This analysis shows that there is hope. If you're low-risk, you're likely to stay that way. If you're in a higher risk, that's likely to change,\" said the study's senior author, Dr. Daniel Goldenholz. He's an instructor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School in Boston. </p><p>The study's lead author, Dr. Neishay Ayub, said researchers \"would like patients to get evaluations for their risk of SUDEP each year and be treated and counseled appropriately about that risk.\" </p><p>Ayub, a clinical fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, said the study wasn't able to tease out why risk levels changed, but one reason may be a change in epilepsy treatment. Fewer seizures per year lower the risk of SUDEP, according to the researchers. </p><p>SUDEP refers to deaths in epilepsy patients that aren't related to injury, drowning or other known causes. Most cases of SUDEP occur during or soon after a seizure, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Possible causes include pauses in breathing, abnormal heart rhythms or a combination of those factors. </p><p>About one to two cases a year of SUDEP occur for every 1,000 people with epilepsy, the CDC says. Known risks include frequent seizures and having generalized convulsive seizures (also known as grand mal or tonic-clonic seizures). </p><p> \"SUDEP is rare in the sense of your risk per year, but if you have epilepsy for 30 years, the risk is substantial,\" said Dr. Shlomo Shinnar, president of the American Epilepsy Society.</p><p>He said the good news is that progress is being made. \"We're doing a better job of identifying risk factors and looking at ways to modify the risk of SUDEP,\" he added.</p><p>But Goldenholz, Ayub and colleagues thought patients needed more information.</p><p> \"One of the things we saw that was kind of scary is that although we can tell people what their risk is, there was no long-term outlook. Will this risk always be very high? Will it always be low?\" Goldenholz said. </p><p>To answer those questions, the researchers reviewed data from more than 1.4 million seizures reported by 12,402 people with epilepsy. The seizures were recorded in an app called \"Seizure Tracker.\" </p><p>Researchers looked at the number of seizures a year each person had. People with zero were placed in the low-risk category. </p><p>Those who had one or two generalized seizures each year were considered medium-risk. And people who had three or more generalized seizures annually were considered at high risk of SUDEP. </p><p>After three years, about 41 percent of those in the high-risk group remained in that category and just 5 percent in the medium-risk category stayed in the same risk group, researchers found. More than 77 percent of those considered low-risk remained in that category after three years. </p><p>Shinnar said the study has some limitations. One is that seizure data is self-reported by patients. Another is that none of the people actually had a SUDEP event, making it difficult to capture the actual risk, he said. </p><p>The goal, Shinnar said, is for patients to be seizure-free.</p><p> \"If you're seizure-free, we eliminate the risk of SUDEP essentially. If you're seizure-free, you have an extraordinarily low risk of SUDEP,\" Shinnar said. </p><p>Results of the study were scheduled to be presented Sunday at the American Epilepsy Society annual meeting, in New Orleans. Findings presented at meetings are typically considered preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about  <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/about/sudep/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">sudden unexpected death in epilepsy</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Dec. 3, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Yet another study reveals that autism is far more common than once thought, with nearly 3 percent of American children diagnosed with the disorder.</p><p>A federal study published last week reported that one in 40 children have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and a second study that was published online  Dec. 3 in the journal <i>JAMA Pediatrics</i> arrived at the same conclusion. Previously, it was estimated that one in 59 children have autism.</p><p>More troubling was that Dr. Wei Bao, lead researcher on the second study, found that 30 percent of kids who are diagnosed aren't getting treatment.</p><p>\"We know that autism may have lifetime impact to the individual and the family,\" said Bao, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Iowa. \"There should be efforts to reduce the number of those untreated to as low as possible.\"</p><p>It's not clear who did and did not receive treatment, Bao added. It might be that untreated children have a very mild form of autism, he noted.</p><p>\"Because the rate of autism keeps increasing, more and more children need treatment, and many may be waiting to see a doctor,\" Bao said.  </p><p>The reasons more kids are identified with autism  are unclear, Bao said. He speculated that it's probably a combination of a real increase in the condition coupled with better diagnosis and changing definitions of autism that have identified more forms of the disease. </p><p>Autism spectrum disorder covers a wide range of behaviors that affect a child's social and communication skills. It's often marked by difficulty communicating, engaging in repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. In its most serious manifestation, children can be nonverbal and appear cut off from the world. Many children, however, have less severe forms of autism and are able to function in school and in social situations. </p><p>Autism is often treated with medications that help alleviate symptoms, and also behavioral therapy. Nearly 64 percent of children with the disorder in the study received behavioral treatment, and 27 percent took medications, Bao's team found. </p><p>The researchers also found geographic differences in where autism is more or less common. Bao isn't sure why these disparities exist -- it might be due to the prevalence of diagnosis, differences in racial and ethnic groups, or environmental triggers, he suggested.</p><p>For the study, Bao and colleagues collected data on 43,000 children who took part in the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health. The investigators found that 2.8 percent of the children had been diagnosed with autism. The same database was mined in the earlier government study.</p><p> Thomas Frazier is chief science officer for Autism Speaks, an autism advocacy organization. He said, \"The one in 40 number from this study shows that ASD is common, and contributes to data indicating that autism prevalence continues to increase.\" </p><p>Autism is and should continue to be a public health priority, he said, so \"we need to understand why the prevalence is increasing.\" </p><p>This study and earlier studies have shown that many children with autism are not being identified as early as they could be, Frazier added. \"Even when children are identified early, many have difficulty accessing treatments and services,\" he said.</p><p>Several things can be done to improve this situation, Frazier suggested. For example, better access to treatment is needed, especially in areas where the availability of services is limited. In addition, parents need training in techniques that have been shown to be effective in improving the developmental abilities of children with autism. </p><p>Frazier also said that health insurance needs to cover autism treatment, and public funding is needed to cover treatment for the uninsured.</p><p>Importantly, he said, \"families need to be connected to interventions and other supports as soon as a developmental condition is identified.\" </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about <a href=\" https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/index.html \" target=\"_new\">autism</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Jan. 4, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- More than 10 percent of U.S. adults have a food allergy -- and nearly double that believe they do, a new study estimates.</p><p>Researchers found that 19 percent of those surveyed thought they had a food allergy. But when the investigators dug into people's symptoms, they found that only 10.8 percent reported \"convincing\" signs of a true allergy.</p><p>Experts said the findings highlight two important facts: Food allergies are common among U.S. adults, and many mistakenly believe they have one.</p><p>\"There are many misconceptions around reactions to food,\" said lead researcher Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University, in Chicago.</p><p>According to Gupta, it can be easy for people to assume food-related symptoms signal an allergy. But other conditions can be the real culprit, she said.</p><p>People with true allergies have an immune system reaction against proteins in a particular food. Those reactions, Gupta explained, can sometimes be severe -- including life-threatening breathing difficulties or drops in blood pressure.</p><p>So it's critical to get an accurate diagnosis, she noted.</p><p>Dr. Wayne Shreffler, a medical advisor to the non-profit Food Allergy Research &amp; Education, agreed.</p><p>\"Sometimes people think, 'What difference does it make? If the food makes me feel bad, I'll avoid it,'\" Shreffler said.</p><p>But people with a true allergy need to completely eliminate the offending food from their diet -- and they should get professional guidance on how to do that, he suggested.</p><p>They should also get a prescription for epinephrine, Shreffler said. The drug, given by auto-injector, treats severe allergic reactions in an emergency.</p><p>On the flip side, food avoidance can be very challenging -- so people without an allergy should not do it unnecessarily, he added.</p><p>What other conditions can cause food-related woes? One possibility, Gupta said, is a food intolerance -- such as difficulty digesting lactose, a sugar in milk.</p><p>Unlike allergies, food intolerances do not involve the immune system. They arise from an issue in the digestive system -- like an enzyme deficiency -- that makes it hard to break down a particular food.</p><p>In other cases, Gupta said, people have an oral allergy syndrome. That occurs when someone with a pollen allergy has a reaction to a food with proteins similar to pollen -- usually a raw fruit or vegetable. The symptoms include itchiness in the mouth or throat, or swelling around the lips.</p><p>That type of reaction is not life-threatening, and people may be able to avert it by simply cooking the offending produce, Gupta said.</p><p>The study, published online Jan. 4 in <i>JAMA Network Open</i>, included more than 40,400 U.S. adults.</p><p>Overall, 19 percent reported food allergies. However, only 10.8 percent had ever suffered \"convincing\" symptoms -- such as hives, throat constriction, lip or tongue swelling, vomiting, difficulty breathing or rapid heartbeat.</p><p>Certain other symptoms -- like cramps or diarrhea -- were not considered convincing, because they are more likely to indicate a food intolerance.</p><p>Among people with true allergies, shellfish was the most common culprit: An estimated 3 percent of adults were allergic to shellfish. Milk allergy (1.9 percent) and peanut allergy (1.8 percent) were next in line. Many people had more than one food allergy, the findings showed.</p><p>And surprisingly, allergies often developed in adulthood, rather than childhood. Almost half of participants with convincing symptoms developed at least one of their allergies as an adult, according to the report.</p><p>It has long been known that adults can develop new food allergies. But Gupta was \"really surprised\" by how often that was reported in the study.</p><p>Shreffler agreed, calling the finding \"striking.\"</p><p>It's not fully clear why food allergies arise in adults, according to Shreffler. But in some cases, he said, it may be a matter of exposure. Many kids turn their noses up at shellfish, for example -- so an allergy might not become apparent until later in life.</p><p>Gupta's team also found that only half of study participants with convincing food allergy symptoms had ever received a formal diagnosis.</p><p>Some may self-diagnose and skip the doctor visit, both Gupta and Shreffler said. But it's also possible for doctors to miss the diagnosis.</p><p>\"I think that finding is a bit of a wake-up call to the medical community,\" Shreffler said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Food Allergy Research &amp; Education has more on <a href=\"https://www.foodallergy.org/life-with-food-allergies/food-allergy-101/diagnosis-testing\" target=\"_new\">food allergy diagnosis</a>.</p>",

She is a scientist with the Center for Research and Epidemiology and Statistics at the Sorbonne Paris Cite.</p><p>\"If our findings are confirmed, organic food consumption may contribute to cancer prevention,\" Baudry said, though the study did not prove they directly caused cancer risk to drop.</p><p>And people shouldn't stop eating fruits and vegetables if they can't afford more expensive organically grown options.</p><p>Filling your diet with fruits and vegetables is known to reduce your risk of chronic disease and cancer, regardless of whether or not they're organic, Baudry and other experts said.</p><p> Mark Guinter, a postdoctoral fellow with the American Cancer Society, said, \"More importantly than anything is making sure you consume your fruits and vegetables, avoid your red and processed meat, and eat whole grains. Those are established relationships with cancer, replicated in multiple populations.\"</p><p> Guinter added that  \"if people are interested in changing their diets or buying foods that are known to help prevent their cancer risk, those would certainly be avenues to take rather than simply buying organic.\"</p><p>For this study, Baudry and her colleagues analyzed data from nearly 69,000 people taking part in an ongoing French study of the associations between nutrition and health.</p><p>The participants all filled out questionnaires regarding their consumption of organic products. These included fruits and vegetables, dairy, meat and fish, eggs, breads and other foods.</p><p>They also filled out annual questionnaires regarding the status of their health, including instances of cancer, and were followed for 4.5 years on average.</p><p>The researchers found an association between eating organic foods and lower cancer risk, even after taking into account other risk factors for cancer.</p><p>\"We did consider a variety of factors that may be involved in the relationship,\" Baudry said, \"such as sociodemographic, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, as well as family history of cancer, or healthier diet in terms of nutrients and food consumption. Controlling for these factors did not substantially modify the findings.\"</p><p>Organic foods are grown without pesticides, fertilizers and other chemicals. Studies have shown that people who eat organic foods have lower levels of pesticide residue in their urine, she noted.</p><p>\"Exposure to pesticide has been associated with higher cancer risk\" in previous studies, Baudry said.</p><p>Specifically, Guinter said, this study supports results from a British study that also found an association between organic food consumption and lower risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</p><p>\"Whenever you see a result that's replicated like that, you find it a little more believable. There's good biologic plausibility behind it,\" Guinter explained.</p><p>According to Dr. Frank Hu, chair of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, animal studies have shown that pesticides can increase DNA damage, which can increase risk of cancer. Chemicals also can disrupt the endocrine system.</p><p>But, Guinter and Hu said, there's not enough human evidence yet upon which to base any new dietary recommendations.</p><p>People should eat right and maintain a healthy weight through diet and exercise to prevent cancer, Hu said. Cutting back on alcohol also will help.</p><p>\"Basically, increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables, whether conventional or organic, can improve overall diet quality and reduce your risk of chronic disease, including cancer,\" said Hu, senior author of an editorial accompanying the new study.</p><p>The report was published online Oct. 22 in <i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Cancer Society has more about <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/healthy/eat-healthy-get-active/acs-guidelines-nutrition-physical-activity-cancer-prevention/common-questions.html\" target=\"_new\">diet and cancer risk</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Oct. 30, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Swimmer extraordinaire Michael Phelps has won 28 Olympic medals -- 23 of them gold. Yet, despite all those medals and the accolades that came with them, Phelps has struggled with depression and anxiety. </p><p>In 2014, it got so bad that he locked himself in his bedroom and stayed there for days.</p><p>\"During those days, I had thoughts of not wanting to be alive,\" Phelps said. \"The longer I stayed in my room by myself, I thought there has to be another way.\" </p><p>That's when Phelps checked himself in for inpatient mental health treatment.</p><p>\"As an athlete, I learned that we're supposed to be these big macho people that don't have any problems, and we're not supposed to show weakness, but that's so wrong. I'm so thankful that I can ask for help now,\" he explained.</p><p>Phelps spoke of his inner struggles as the keynote speaker at a recent New York City conference held by Talkspace, an online counseling service. </p> <p>The famed athlete holds the all-time record for an individual with the most Olympic gold medals. He announced his retirement from swimming in 2016. </p> <p>\"I have spent my whole life submerged in water. I ate, slept and swam. That's really all I did my whole life. I'm really just learning how to live now, and it's frustrating at times. But it's also rewarding,\" Phelps said. </p><p>He's also learned that depression and anxiety will be ongoing challenges for him.</p><p>\"You don't go through a depression spell one day and have it go away. Therapy helps me sharpen my tools to be prepared for whatever comes my way,\" Phelps said.</p><p>\"I've gone through multiple stages of depression, and I deal with anxiety all the time. There are lots of people struggling with the exact same things, so if I can get one message out there, it's that 'It's OK not to be OK,' \" he said. </p><p>Phelps explained that therapy is helping him continually learn how to be as healthy as he can be mentally.</p><p>\"I know there are some things that have to happen throughout the day. For me, a workout is so important. It's something I have to do, and if I don't, I'm an absolute nightmare. As soon as I work out, I can relax a little bit,\" he said.</p><p>Phelps also makes sure he communicates openly with people, especially his wife, Nicole. </p><p>\"Throughout my career, I got very good at compartmentalizing and stuffing things away and not dealing with any of it. I finally learned to communicate at 30 in therapy,\" he said. </p><p>He also makes sure he always has access to his therapist. \"I've picked up the things that work for me, because I want to be a better father, a better husband and a better friend,\" he said. </p><p>Dr. Richard Catanzaro, chairman of psychiatry at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y., said it helps reduce some of the stigma of mental illness when someone like Phelps comes forward. It also helps people realize that anyone can get depressed. </p><p>\"Everyone has their own internal struggles. Everyone is measuring up to a vision of themselves, and most people can't take on the perspective of everyone around them. When you start to make those comparisons, like, 'Why should <i>you</i> be depressed when you have everything,' you make the person feel guilty and invalidated,\" he noted.</p><p>\"It's absolutely possible to be outwardly successful and be inwardly very depressed and anxious. What people see are artificial indications of success -- money, career or extraordinary athletic feats. But that's not an indication of a whole life,\" Catanzaro said.</p><p>And, that's one of the things Phelps said he'd love for people to know about him. </p><p>\"I'm a human being. What I did in the water doesn't define who I am as a person. I think everybody only thinks of me as a swimmer, and not as an individual, and that's frustrating,\" Phelps explained. </p><p>He said people seem to think he's superhuman. But, he said, \"I was very passionate about what I did and I never gave up. That's why everything happened the way it did in my career.\" </p><p>Today, Phelps said helping other people realize that they're not alone, and that it's OK to ask for help, is what really brings him joy. </p><p>\"People come up to me and share their stories and their struggles, and for me, that's the greatest thing in the world. A chance to save a life is better than winning any gold medals,\" he said. </p><p>Catanzaro said symptoms of depression are different for different people. But some of the signs to look out for include changes in sleeping or eating patterns; a change in mood; not finding pleasure or finding very little pleasure in anything; and feelings of wanting to end your life -- whether actively thinking of ways to kill yourself or even just wishing that you wouldn't wake up.</p><p>If you're suicidal, call a suicide hotline or 911 right away, Catanzaro said. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about depression from the <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression/index.shtml\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institute of Mental Health</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 21, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- A test that measures wavelengths of light coming off skin cells might detect type 2 diabetes, heart disease and even your risk of dying, new research shows.</p><p>It's possible that -- someday -- a quick \"autofluorescence\" light test to the skin might be used by consumers in \"supermarkets, pharmacies or drugstores as a first estimate of [health] risk,\" according to a Dutch research team.</p><p>The new device is called an AGE Reader, with AGE standing for chemicals found on skin cells called \"advanced glycation end-products.\"</p><p>AGEs are natural byproducts of illness that can -- using the AGE Reader -- glow or \"fluoresce\" on the skin, explained the researchers led by Bruce Wolffenbuttel of the University of Groningen.</p><p>Their new study tested the device on the skin of nearly 73,000 people whose health was then tracked up to 10 years, with an average follow-up of four years.</p><p>During the follow-up period, more than 1,000 participants went on to develop type 2 diabetes, close to 1,300 developed heart disease and 928 died.</p><p>A 1-unit rise in skin autofluorescence using the AGE Reader \"was associated with a threefold increase in risk of type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease, and a five-times increased risk of death,\" the researchers reported Nov. 21 in the journal <i>Diabetologia</i>.</p><p>What's more, the device's power at predicting death or disease remained steady even when telltale risk factors -- such as obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol or poor blood sugar control -- were absent, the study found.</p><p>Even after adjusting for those risk factors, a 1-unit rise in the AGE Reader autofluorescence score was tied to a 26 percent rise in risk for type 2 diabetes; a 33 percent rise in heart disease risk; and a near-doubling of the odds for death during the follow-up period.</p><p>The bottom line is that the new findings support skin autofluorescence \"as a first screening method to predict type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and mortality,\" the researchers said in a journal news release.</p><p>One U.S. diabetes specialist was intrigued by the research.</p><p>Dr. Gerald Bernstein directs the Friedman Diabetes Program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He wasn't involved in the new study, but is familiar with \"AGE\" chemicals as natural indicators of health.</p><p>\"What's a good example of an AGE that everyone can recognize? On Thanksgiving we put a turkey in the oven with the goal of having a beautiful bird with beautiful browned skin. That browning occurs because of the AGEs in the turkey skin,\" Bernstein noted.</p><p>He explained that in live humans, these proteins \"stick to each other and form a web, and this web is an AGE. The formation of AGEs contribute to the complications of diabetes.\"</p><p>Because AGEs can gradually increase over time, doctors might someday \"easily screen whole populations by the fluorescent technique to identify who has AGEs and is therefore at risk,\" Bernstein said.</p><p>A heart specialist agreed. Dr. Guy Mintz called the study \"impressive,\" and said devices like the AGE Reader \"could be a game-changer in cardiovascular and diabetic risk assessment.\" He directs cardiovascular health at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y.</p><p>Mintz said studies where the AGE Reader was used on a patient's skin before and after medical treatments would be interesting \"to see if the pattern of skin autofluorescence changes with medical and lifestyle interventions.\"</p><p>However, Mintz did have one reservation: \"I do not agree with the author's [notion] that this technology can be used in nonclinical settings, such as pharmacies, to assess patients' risk.\" He said non-physicians could easily misinterpret test results and that might harm, not help, patients.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Diabetes Association offers more on <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/\" target=\"_new\">diabetes</a>.</p>",

It was only when family members stopped smoking marijuana at home that his breathing got better, according to his doctor.</p><p>The boy's case shows that exposure to secondhand pot smoke can worsen asthma in children who have a marijuana allergy, a new study reports.</p><p>The child's relatives frequently smoked marijuana in the house, said Dr. Bryce Hoffman, lead author of the report.</p><p>\"Even though family members didn't smoke marijuana in the same room as the child, he was exposed to traces of smoke and plant material,\" explained Hoffman, an allergy and immunology specialist in Denver.</p><p>\"It was not clear why his asthma was so severe and not responding to aggressive asthma therapies until we determined he was allergic to cannabis. After the cannabis was removed from the house, his asthma improved,\" Hoffman said in a news release from the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI). </p><p>The case study also said that the boy's grandmother had a history of hives after personal use of marijuana.</p><p>\"Although the boy didn't have any clear allergic symptoms such as hives -- like his grandmother -- we know indoor allergens like pets and dust mites can make asthma worse without obvious allergic symptoms,\" Hoffman said.</p><p>This type of trigger is different from secondhand tobacco smoke, which worsens asthma by irritating the lungs in a non-allergic way, he explained.</p><p>\"The takeaway is that cannabis allergy can make asthma worse even without direct use. Anyone using cannabis needs to consider that others living in their house who have asthma -- particularly children -- may be at risk of uncontrolled asthma,\" Hoffman said.</p><p>Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition. If you have asthma, your airways become inflamed and swell, making it difficult to breathe.</p><p>The study was presented recently at the annual ACAAI meeting, in Seattle.

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 29, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The hearts of women who snore appear to become damaged more quickly than those of men who \"saw lumber\" at night, a new study suggests.</p><p>Evaluating nearly 4,500 British adults who underwent cardiac imaging, researchers also learned that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may be vastly underdiagnosed among snorers.</p><p>This finding surprised study author Dr. Adrian Curta, who heads  cardiac imaging at Munich University Hospital in Germany.</p><p>\"A further surprise was the different manifestation of disease according to gender,\" Curta said. \"Females show different alterations in cardiac [measures]. A possible reason for this could be that women with OSA are more vulnerable to cardiac alterations.\"</p> <p>Loud snoring is a hallmark of obstructive sleep apnea, which affects between 3 percent and 7 percent of adults in the United States, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Also characterized by brief periods where breathing stops, often followed by gasping for air, sleep apnea is becoming recognized as a contributor to serious health conditions, such as high blood pressure, heart disease and poor blood sugar metabolism.</p><p>Sleep apnea treatment depends on the cause. Treatments include surgery to open narrowed upper airways or using a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine while sleeping.</p><p>Curta and his colleagues evaluated data from the UK Biobank, which follows the health and well-being of 500,000 volunteers. The researchers  looked at data from nearly 4,500 participants who underwent cardiac imaging. These study volunteers were split into three groups: 38 with obstructive sleep apnea; 1,919 who reported snoring; and 2,536 without OSA or snoring.</p><p>In both men and women, those with sleep apnea and snoring tended to have larger left ventricles of the heart, meaning the walls were enlarged and the heart was working harder to pump, Curta said.</p><p>But when the snoring group was compared to the unaffected group, a more significant difference was found in the size of the left ventricle among women compared to men. These cardiac changes in self-reported snorers suggest earlier heart impairment in women and could point to undiagnosed sleep apnea, he said.</p> <p>The findings suggest the transition from snoring to obstructive sleep apnea is an evolving process linked to a potentially dangerous enlargement of the left ventricle. But the research did not prove that sleep apnea causes heart changes, only that an association exists between the two.</p><p>Curta noted that researchers are still uncertain why snoring would remodel women's hearts more quickly than men's. More research needs to be done to understand this process, he said.</p><p>\"The most important clinical implication is that we need better prevention for OSA, such as a broader information program,\" Curta said. \"Individuals with snoring should ask someone to observe them during sleep if they show periods of breathing cessation.\"</p><p>Those who do stop breathing while sleeping should undergo a sleep study to determine how advanced their sleep apnea is and the proper treatment, Curta said.</p><p>Dr. Tetyana Kendzerska is a sleep physician at Ottawa Hospital Sleep Center in Canada, and wasn't involved in the new research. Since obesity is a known contributor to snoring and sleep apnea, Kendzerska said losing excess weight is encouraged for those with snoring or sleep apnea.</p> <p>\"We know that men and women report different symptoms for OSA, and as a result, obstructive sleep apnea is seriously underreported and underdiagnosed in women,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Given that potential cardiovascular risk associated with sleep apnea may be greater in women than in men, first we need to identify women with sleep apnea [by] increasing awareness among health care professionals,\" Kendzerska added.</p> <p>The research was to be presented Thursday at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America, in Chicago. Research presented at meetings typically hasn't been peer-reviewed or published, and results are considered preliminary.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more on <a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Sleep-Apnea-Information-Page\" target=\"_new\">sleep apnea</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p> TUESDAY, Oct. 23, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- A child's blood pressure could indicate cognition problems into adulthood, according to a new study suggesting the cardiovascular connection to cognitive decline could begin much earlier in life than previously believed.</p> <p> The findings may provide a window into the roots of dementia, for which high blood pressure is considered a risk factor.</p> <p>\"We wondered is there perhaps some signal early in life that tells us high blood pressure is bad for you throughout your entire life?\" said Dr. Arfan Ikram, lead author of the Dutch study published Oct. 23 in the <i>Journal of the American Heart Association.</i></p> <p> It looked at a group of 5,853 children and 5,187 adults. The average age was about 6 among the kids and 62 for adults. Researchers assessed each participant's blood pressure and arterial stiffness, which is the loss of elasticity in arteries and often considered a sign of aging, vascular disease or both.</p> <p> They also examined cognitive function for both groups. The children were given a set of non-verbal assessments of their abstract reasoning and spatial visualization skills. The results were converted to an IQ score. Adults took five cognition tests that measured a broader range of aptitudes ranging from memory to mental dexterity.</p> <p> The condition of blood vessels played a role in the results for both groups -- but in different ways. Among adults, greater arterial stiffness and higher blood pressure were associated with lower cognition. In children, higher diastolic blood pressure -- the bottom number in a blood pressure reading -- was linked with lower IQ scores.</p> <p> But Ikram cautioned this association was a subtle one.</p> <p>\"This doesn't mean we now need to start doing some kind of intervention at that age,\" said Ikram, chair of the epidemiology department at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. \"What the findings really mean is that we can say, 'Hey, the origins of when blood pressure might start affecting the brain lies really early in life.' \"</p> <p> The American Heart Association recommends children have their blood pressure checked once a year. For adults, the recommendation is at least once every two years if blood pressure is normal and more often if it's above normal.</p> <p> Ikram said parents and adults in general should make prevention a priority.</p> <p>\"For instance, you can make sure blood pressure doesn't increase through lifestyle interventions, especially regular physical activity or reduced salt intake,\" he said. \"We really need to make sure such things start early in life and not when people are, say, 40 or 50 years of age and thinking, 'I need to make sure my health is maintained, because I'm starting to suffer from various ailments.' \"</p> <p> About 50 million people worldwide have dementia, with nearly 10 million new cases each year, according to the World Health Organization. </p> <p> Past studies have found links to high blood pressure and other cardiovascular risks.</p> <p>Most related research focuses on older adults, although some emerging studies include data on middle-aged patients, said Angela Jefferson, a neurology professor and director of the Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer's Center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.</p> <p>\"The inclusion of a younger population of children taken together with the middle-aged adults offers interesting information about how blood pressure and arterial health relate to brain health,\" said Jefferson, who was not involved in the study.</p> <p> The use of different cognition tests for the two study groups makes it a little difficult to compare the results exactly, she said. But \"because children's brains continue to develop until the late teens, we use different tests to assess their cognitive health.\"</p> <p> What's more significant is tracking the \"precise timing of when aging and disease affect the body's arterial blood supply\" and the impact that has on the brain, Jefferson said.</p> <p>\"If we can pinpoint the window of intervention, we can make a stronger effort to improve cardiovascular health and reduce complications on brain health, cognition and presumably dementia,\" she said.</p>",

Blood tests will be drawn to see if concentrations of the medicines are equivalent to those seen in the dogs treated with a similar, already marketed drug.</p><p>That should \"establish a clear benchmark for how these drugs are absorbed in the dogs' blood,\" Gottlieb explained. Once that data is known, calculations can be made that simply \"model the absorption of drugs [by dogs] in the future, rather than requiring the drugs to be tested on live dogs,\" he said.</p><p>The dogs involved in this breakthrough study will be treated well, Gottlieb added.</p><p>\"Because we know that it's important to prepare the dogs to be calm for their blood draws, and to give them a head start on their transition to life as pets, the research staff will work with the dogs to socialize and acclimate them to their environment for at least two months before this study begins,\" he said.</p><p>\"The dogs will receive regular veterinary care, including vaccinations and other preventive care, so that they remain happy, well-socialized and healthy,\" according to Gottlieb. \"At the conclusion of the study, the dogs will be retired for adoption as pets.\" </p><p>The FDA has recently re-focused its efforts on reducing the need for animal trials generally, creating its own Animal Welfare Council in January 2018.  The council provides \"centralized oversight of all animal research activities and facilities under its purview,\" he said.</p><p>Gottlieb stressed that, in some cases, animals are still vital to research that could save people's lives. But, \"we're committed to exploring ways to help FDA scientists and product developers reduce reliance on this practice,\" he said, and the newly proposed study \"is a big part of that effort.\"</p><p>The FDA says it is accepting public comment on the new canine trial over the next 60 days.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Find out more about animal testing at the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/od/science/integrity/acupo/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

There's a third option that might suit you even better.</p><p>The concept is called carb cycling, shorthand for alternating between high- and low-carbohydrate days. There's even a variation that lets you make every seventh day a cheat day.</p><p>The idea is to mesh two theories about carbohydrates -- that low-carb diets lead to more effective weight loss but that carbs are needed to maximize the effects of high-intensity exercise days. Adding in high-carb days could also be better for your metabolism than a constant low-carbohydrate diet.</p><p>Carb cycling lets you tailor carbohydrate intake to your needs. For instance, the American Council on Exercise points out that to lose weight, you might try a plan of five low-carb days and two high-carb days each week. If improving muscle mass is your goal, reverse that ratio -- five high-carb days interspersed with two low-carb days, matching the high-carb days to your most intense workout days.</p><p><b>Carb Cycling to Lose Weight: </b></p><ul><li>Make your low-carb days Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays.</li><li>Make your high-carb days Wednesdays and Saturdays.</li></ul><p><b>Carb Cycling to Boost Muscle: </b></p><ul><li>Make your low-carb days Wednesdays and Saturdays.</li><li>Make your high-carb days Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays.</li></ul><p>Science is just beginning to look at the value of a high-carb/low-protein diet. One 8-week study on mice found it may have the same longevity benefits as calorie restriction. While it's too soon to make projections for people, the researchers point out that however many carbs you eat, they should be high-quality whole grains and vegetables, with moderate fruit intake to limit fructose.</p><p>Processed, packaged high-carb foods with added sugars don't deliver good nutrition and can trigger hormonal changes that can make losing weight harder. Whenever you're putting carbs on the menu, choose fresh or minimally processed foods that are high in fiber and have only naturally occurring sugars.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Council on Exercise has detailed information on <a href=\"https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/lifestyle/blog/5872/what-you-need-to-know-about-carb-cycling\" target=\"_new\">carb cycling</a> to help you try this eating plan.</p>",

The infants were all diagnosed with the sleep disorder by their first birthday.</p><p>Of these children, 193 had central sleep apnea, which occurs when the body temporarily pauses or reduces breathing efforts during sleep. Meanwhile, 679 of the infants had obstructive sleep apnea, which occurs when the throat muscles relax and temporarily block the airway. The discharge documents on the remaining 4,096 infants did not specify the type of sleep apnea the children had.</p><p>\"By studying a limited supply of data, we only got a snapshot of these hospital cases. We were not able to see everything, like what medications the infants were on or what diagnosis they had,\" said study leader Dr. Daniel Combs, a sleep specialist at the university.</p><p>Still, the analysis revealed that infants with central sleep apnea and a heart abnormality had the worst outcomes.

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 3, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Preschoolers who quickly pack on pounds may be at particular risk of becoming obese teenagers, a large new study finds.</p><p>Experts said the results point to a critical \"window\" in early childhood -- between the ages of 2 and 5 or 6 years -- that can set the stage for persistent obesity.</p><p>They also said the findings leave some questions unanswered. Why do some young children gain excessive amounts of body fat? And will altering their diets ultimately prevent obesity later on?</p><p>The study looked at weight-gain patterns among more than 51,000 German children.</p><p>Researchers found that more than half of obese teenagers had already become overweight or obese by age 5. And the strongest risk factor for teen obesity was faster-than-normal weight gain between the ages of 2 and 6.</p><p>The findings are \"very important,\" said Dr. Michael Freemark, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. Both were published Oct. 4 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>. </p><p>\"This identifies a developmental window that's a powerful predictor of obesity in adolescence,\" said Freemark, a professor of pediatrics at Duke University in Durham, N.C.</p><p>He explained what the normal trajectory of weight gain looks like early in life. First, babies pack on a lot of fat, which is healthy and necessary, Freemark said. By the time they are 1 year old, their body mass index (BMI) should be much higher than it was in early infancy. (BMI is a measure of weight in relation to height.)</p><p>After that, BMI declines as a child grows taller and sheds \"baby fat\" -- hitting a low around the age of 5 or 6. Then, Freemark said, there is a body-fat \"rebound\" where BMI gradually rises through the rest of childhood and the teen years.</p><p>According to Freemark, this study suggests that if the rebound happens early -- or if children never lose their baby fat -- the risk of teen obesity rises.</p><p>\"What this doesn't tell us is why those children gained weight excessively during this developmental window,\" Freemark said.</p><p>There may be a role for factors earlier in life -- such as whether kids were breastfed or bottle-fed, or whether their moms had diabetes during pregnancy, according to Freemark.</p><p>\"But it's probably related to a number of variables,\" he said.</p><p>Dr. Antje Korner, the senior researcher on the study, agreed.</p><p>The roots of obesity are \"complex,\" and involve a mix of genes and environmental influences, said Korner, of the University of Leipzig's Center for Pediatric Research in Germany.</p><p>What's important, said Korner, is that parents and pediatricians are aware of this \"critical\" age window where obesity risk manifests itself.</p><p>When children that age are overweight, she said, it should not be dismissed as baby fat that will go away.</p><p>In the United States, 1 in 5 children and teens is overweight, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This sets them up for future health problems such as diabetes and heart disease.</p><p>The current study was based on 51,505 kids whose BMI was measured repeatedly during childhood and adolescence.</p><p>In most cases, the study found, normal-weight teens had been normal-weight their whole lives. But the picture was different for obese teens: Before age 2 they usually had a normal BMI, but 53 percent had become overweight or obese by age 5.</p><p>And children with an early \"acceleration\" in BMI during the preschool years were at heightened risk of teen obesity. Their odds were 40 percent higher, versus kids whose BMI held steady during preschool.</p><p>For now, Freemark said, it's not clear whether changing those youngsters' diets will ward off teen obesity.</p><p>But he encouraged parents to take their kids to routine checkups, to see whether their weight gain is on track. If it's excessive, Freemark said, parents might need nutrition counseling.</p><p>He also pointed to some general diet rules that are \"reasonable for any child\" -- such as avoiding sugary drinks, sweets and fast food, and limiting fried foods and starches.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Nemours Foundation has more on <a href=\"https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/overweight-obesity.html?WT.ac=p-ra\" target=\"_new\">childhood obesity</a>.</p>",

Of those trials, eight involved fully vegan diets, while the remainder were vegetarian. The trials lasted an average 23 weeks.</p><p>People eating plant-based diets experienced an improvement in their physical health and better control of their diabetes, the findings showed.</p><p>\"These studies demonstrated that this eating pattern helped them to better control their serum glucose [blood sugar] levels, as well as improve their lipid and cholesterol levels,\" Toumpanakis said.</p><p>People eating the plant-based diets also experienced a marked easing of their diabetes-related nerve pain, with the results suggesting that such an eating plan might slow progressive nerve damage associated with diabetes, the researchers said.</p><p>In six of the studies, patients were able to cut down or discontinue drugs they were taking either for their diabetes or for symptoms of diabetes.</p><p>The studies also found that people experienced improved psychological well-being. Depression levels dropped, while overall quality of life improved.</p><p>\"We would say that people with type 2 diabetes following a plant-based diet might be happier because, as the studies suggest, the majority found that through this eating pattern they can have a better control of their condition,\" Toumpanakis said.</p><p> \"If through diet they can have the power to improve their physical symptoms and their glucose levels, and reduce or even stop some of their medication, then this has a huge impact on their quality of life,\" he added.</p><p>Toumpanakis said there's nothing to be lost in switching to a plant-based diet, noting that both the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American College of Endocrinology promote vegetarian or vegan diets as the optimal nutrition plan for people with diabetes.</p><p>But the study didn't prove that a plant-based diet improved the patients' mental and physical health, just that there was an association.</p><p>And Al Bochi isn't ready to embrace the review's findings.</p><p>She noted that of the 11 studies included in the review, only four tracked the people's psychological well-being.</p><p>\"Keeping that in mind, we're working with very small sample sizes,\" Al Bochi said.</p><p>Prior studies have shown that food can play a role in a person's mood, she said, but \"whether there's an exact mechanism with meat products and mood, I'm not sure if there is an actual association.\"</p><p>In addition, protein can increase the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that can help improve mood, she noted.</p><p> Al Bochi suggested that people can best control their mood through food by making sure they eat regular meals, to prevent the \"hangry\" feelings that can come from blood sugar swings.</p><p>\"There's a lot of different nutrients we know that can help with mood.

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Sept. 18, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Will Treinen has never been one to sit on the sidelines. The 51-year-old entrepreneur sacrificed many nights and weekends building a successful consulting company in Olympia, Washington. When he's off the clock, Will and his wife, Denise, enjoy spending time with their two grown daughters and two young grandchildren, as well as hiking, rock climbing and biking.</p> <p>\"My energy has always been forward,\" Will said. \"As a business person, I'm always thinking six to 12 months in the future.\"</p> <p>In 2017, the couple embarked on the STP, a two-day ride from Seattle to Portland. On the first day, Will felt great. But the next morning, shortly into their ride, he was overcome by exhaustion and couldn't catch his breath.</p> <p>This had happened before while training; he suspected sports-induced asthma and urged Denise to ride ahead. But when she went back for him a few minutes later, Will was lying on the ground surrounded by a group of bikers. His skin was blue, and he was gasping for breath. </p> <p>Fortunately, Madeline Dahl, a then-24-year-old cardiac nurse from Seattle who was riding the STP with her father, arrived upon the scene. When she couldn't find Will's pulse, she began giving chest compressions.</p> <p>Approximately 90 percent of people who experience a cardiac arrest outside of the hospital die, according to the American Heart Association. But performed immediately, CPR can double or triple the odds of survival. By the time the paramedics arrived, Madeline had performed several rounds of CPR. </p> <p>Will's pulse returned briefly before fading again.</p> <p>Paramedics took over from Madeline and were still performing CPR when the ambulance departed for the hospital, shocking Will with a defibrillator between compressions. Later that day, Madeline was disappointed to hear from another rider that he had not survived. </p> <p>\"I felt sad for Denise that he hadn't made it despite my best efforts,\" Madeline said.</p> <p>The rumors of Will's death were exaggerated.</p> <p>The first thing he remembers clearly is waking up in the hospital in Tacoma, eight days later, having undergone open-heart surgery to correct an 80 to 90 percent blockage in his main coronary artery. Tubes were coming out of his abdomen, and he felt disoriented by the medications.</p> <p>Although his father had died of heart disease, Will had few obvious risk factors. Unlike his father, he did not smoke, and his cholesterol and blood pressure were not considered by doctors to be cause for concern.</p> <p>Alone at night, he contemplated his mortality. </p> <p>\"I was on the edge a couple of times,\" Will said. \"In every sense, I was dead, and they revived me. Why? What's my purpose?\"</p> <p>One of Will's first actions was to email the top management at his company, asking them to handle the business in his absence. He didn't return to work for months; even now, more than a year later, he only checks in two or three days a week. He'd always planned to retire in his 50s, he said, although perhaps not as young as 51. </p> <p>\"I realized that I was valuing my progress in the business world over my relationships with my children and my experiences with them,\" Will said.</p>   <p>Madeline learned that Will survived several days after the race. A co-worker saw a story on the evening news about Will's cardiac event and the mystery nurse who saved him.</p> <p>The mystery was solved, and Will and Denise eventually invited Madeline to their house for dinner.</p> <p>\"I see plenty of bad outcomes, so seeing somebody who is doing so well is renewing,\" Madeline said.</p> <p>Motivated by his experience, Will is working to raise awareness about the importance of CPR. He spoke at an annual executive breakfast sponsored by the Tacoma chapter of the AHA earlier this year, and he formed a team for the 2018 South Sound Heart &amp; Stroke Walk on Sept. 22.</p> <p>\"I'm a very passionate person, and when I put my energy into something, it's 100 percent,\" Will said.</p> <p>Indeed, less than four months after Will had his cardiac arrest, he and Denise hiked to the 4,000-foot summit of Mount Rose in Washington state -- a longtime item on their bucket list. And the year after Will's life nearly ended during the STP race, he and Denise did the STP again. Knee pain prompted Will to stop after the first day, but Denise pressed on and finished, pausing for an emotional moment near mile 115, where the life-changing incident occurred.</p> <p>\"It was extremely therapeutic for us (riding the first day together),\" Will said. \"We had a blast.\"</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 5, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Caffeine-laden energy drinks are popular, but they might make your blood vessels less efficient, a small study suggests. </p><p>These drinks -- sold as Monster and Red Bull, to name two -- have been linked to heart, nerve and stomach problems, researchers say. </p><p>\"A lot of young kids use energy drinks when they exercise, a time when you need your arterial function to be at its top,\" said lead researcher Dr. John Higgins. He's a  professor of medicine at McGovern Medical School at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston. </p><p>Exercise and sports require maximum blood flow so oxygen can get to cells quickly, Higgins said. Energy drinks that reduce the vessels' diameter, in effect, restrict blood flow and oxygen delivery, he explained.</p><p>\"It's more work for the heart and less oxygen supply for the heart. This could explain why there have been cases where kids have had a cardiac arrest after an energy drink,\" he said. </p><p>Plus, people often chug energy drinks so they get the full effect in one shot, and that might be dangerous, Higgins said.</p><p>\"These drinks are not intended for children,\" Higgins warned. In addition, people under 18, women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, caffeine-sensitive individuals, those taking stimulants or caffeine-based drugs or those with heart disease should stay away from energy drinks, he added. </p><p>The study included 44 healthy, non-smoking medical students in their 20s. The researchers tested the effect of a 24-ounce energy drink on cells lining blood vessels, called endothelial cells.</p><p>The function of these cells was tested before and after the participants consumed the energy drink, and again 90 minutes later. The researchers looked at artery flow-mediated dilation -- an ultrasound measurement that is an indicator of overall blood vessel health. </p><p>After 90 minutes, the internal diameter of blood vessels tested was dramatically smaller, on average, than before, the investigators found. </p><p>This negative effect on blood vessels may be related to ingredients in the energy drink, such as caffeine, taurine, sugar and other herbals, the researchers suggested. Taurine is an amino acid touted as increasing energy and was originally extracted from bull semen -- hence the name Red Bull, the researchers said. </p><p>According to Dr. David Katz, director of Yale University's Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center, \"Endothelial function is, in general, a potent indicator of cardiovascular risk.\" </p><p>But, Katz said, \"this is a small study looking only at acute effects and cannot be considered proof that energy drinks injure the cardiovascular system over time.\" </p><p>That being said, the combination of sugar and stimulants in these drinks has no proven benefit, Katz added.</p><p>\"There are far better ways to boost energy, such as standing up and getting a bit of exercise,\" he suggested.  \"In the absence of a reliable benefit, even a low level of risk is objectionable.\"</p><p>A spokesman for an industry group that represents makers of energy drinks said the drinks are safe.</p><p>\"Mainstream energy drinks contain about half the caffeine of a similarly sized cup of coffeehouse coffee, and have been extensively studied and confirmed safe for consumption by government safety authorities worldwide,\" said William Dermody, spokesman for the American Beverage Association. \"Nothing in this preliminary research counters this well-established fact.\"</p><p>The study findings are scheduled for presentation Nov. 12 at a meeting of the American Heart Association, in Chicago. </p><p>Research presented at meetings is typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>To learn more about caffeine and heart disease, visit the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/caffeine-and-heart-disease\" target=\"_new\"> American Heart Association</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 7, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- After stepping out of his golf cart on the 18th fairway, Andrew Lask Jr. felt dizzy and wobbled a bit. He was playing a charity event at Tamarack Country Club in Greenwich, Conn., where, at age 25, Lask was their youngest teaching professional.</p> <p>He tried to focus, but when he looked down at the ball, he became even dizzier.</p> <p>\"My playing partner was up by the green screaming at me to hit,\" Lask said. \"I remember swinging and hitting the ball nowhere in the direction I wanted it to go. Afterward, I went straight to the pro shop to call my father and lie down.\"</p> <p>The dizziness continued, along with a screaming headache, which he and his father thought might be related to heat and a long day of playing. Lask gulped down Gatorade and ate salty chips, while his father insisted on taking him to the emergency room of the nearest hospital.</p> <p>A checkup and CT scan showed nothing irregular, so Lask was sent home.</p> <p>\"I didn't emphasize the burning sensation in my neck and how bad the headache was, but I'm not sure it would have mattered,\" Lask said. \"I was 25 and in excellent shape.\"</p> <p>He felt dizzy and nauseous for several days, staying in bed most of the time. His father took him to an urgent care facility, where doctors thought maybe he had a virus. Then they visited their family doctor, who was concerned enough to order an MRI.</p> <p>Andrew Lask Sr. was in the room when the neurologist looked at the results.</p> <p>\"Oh my God, he had a stroke,\" the doctor said.</p> <p>\"Whoa, how is that possible?\" Andrew Sr. said.</p> <p>Doctors concluded that Lask had suffered from an activity-related stroke, most likely from swinging the golf club. He tore or damaged the inner lining of an artery, which is called an arterial vertebral dissection, causing a clot to form. The clot expanded until it stifled blood flow to the brain.</p> <p>In Lask's case, doctors determined that because he had survived the stroke and was functioning he should heal naturally.</p> <p>\"They kept me in the hospital for a week, but I had no surgeries or medication,\" he said.</p> <p>He continued to be checked every six months for three years, getting a clean bill of health each time. His only lingering symptoms were fatigue and balance issues, which lasted a few years. He also feared a recurrence, though doctors assured him it was a freak occurrence.</p> <p>\"After it happened, it took me a while to play golf again,\" Lask said. \"I returned to golf a year later and I remember being scared after swings that it would hurt my neck, but now I'm back to golf at full strength.\"</p> <p>Lask stayed at the club for another seven years. While the stroke didn't hinder his golf game, it didn't help either, leaving him feeling less marketable for pro positions.</p> <p>\"I always thought I would be a head golf professional or a financial planner, the two things I loved,\" Lask said.</p> <p>So he gave up the golf course for Wall Street. He's now an adviser at Morgan Stanley in Manhattan.</p> <p>Not that he's totally done teaching. </p> <p>\"I'm always giving two-minute swing tips in the hallways, and everyone wants to go to the driving range with me,\" he said.</p> <p>These days, Lask continues to golf for fun, as well as play basketball and tennis, run, and work out at a gym. </p> <p>\"The difference is I carry my phone on me at all times,\" he said. </p> <p>On the plus side, he said he's now more empathetic to others' challenges and health issues. He's also become very active in the American Heart Association's Young Professionals Committee in New York City, which works to raise awareness and funds for heart and stroke issues and research.</p> <p>Lask's father also has drawn strength from his son's stroke, which he memorialized by affixing the hospital visitation sticker from June 8, 2006, to his car dashboard.</p> <p>\"Anytime I'm feeling sorry for myself if things aren't going well,\" he said, \"I look at that sticker and remind myself how lucky I am.\"</p>",

He is an associate professor at the department of investigational cancer therapeutics at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston.</p><p>\"Patients only had one week of exposure to the bacteria, but even with that limited exposure we saw quite interesting and, in some patients, clinically meaningful activity,\" Janku said.</p><p><i>Clostridium novyi</i> has been linked to human illness. In 2000, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a handful of drug users in the United Kingdom fell ill or died after their injection sites became infected with the bacteria.</p><p>The strain used in this clinical trial, <i>Clostridium novyi-NT</i>, had been weakened to prevent it from producing its toxin, which can be lethal in humans, Janku said. The NT stands for \"non-toxic.\"</p><p><i>Clostridium novyi</i> flourishes in low-oxygen environments. Researchers thought this might make the bacteria a prime candidate for cancer fighting, by keeping the infection focused on the tumor site.</p><p>\"Normal tissues, even if they are low on oxygen, they always have enough oxygen to not allow this bacteria to germinate and proliferate,\" Janku explained. \"Cancerous tissue is low in oxygen, most often in the center of the cancers.\"</p><p>To test whether the bacteria could help fight cancer, researchers injected the tumors of 24 patients with a single dose of <i>Clostridium novyi-NT</i>, ranging from 10,000 to 3 million spores.</p><p>Fifteen of the patients had sarcoma, two patients had melanoma, and seven had a variety of cancers, the researchers said.</p><p>The scientists expected <i>Clostridium novyi-NT</i> to help fight the tumor in two ways.</p><p>First, the bacterial infection itself could cause direct destruction of the tumor cells, Janku said.</p><p>\"If that happens, it actually helps to increase the presence of tumor-specific antigens, which are proteins that make a tumor more obvious to the immune system,\" Janku said. \"It can prime the immune system to attack the cancer.\"</p><p>The bacteria also could activate the immune system to fight the cancer even if the infection didn't kill off tumor cells, Janku added.</p><p>Patients in this clinical trial were left with the bacterial infection for one week, and then everyone was given antibiotics to kill off the <i>Clostridium novyi-NT</i>, Janku said.</p><p>\"<i>Clostridium</i> is actually quite susceptible to antibiotics,\" Janku noted.</p><p>The bacteria germinated in the cancers of 11 out of the 24 patients, with tumor cells dying off as a result.</p><p>Tumor shrinkage of greater than 10 percent was observed in 23 percent of patients. However, Janku said this could be an underestimate since the infection causes surrounding tissue to become inflamed, making the lesion appear larger than it actually is.</p><p>Following bacterial therapy, cancer stabilized in 21 patients. When both injected and uninjected lesions were included, the stable disease rate was 86 percent, the researchers reported.</p><p>The potential for <i>Clostridium novyi-NT</i> to prompt an immune response against cancer is intriguing, said Sacha Gnjatic, who is associate director of the Human Immune Monitoring Center at Mount Sinai in New York City.</p><p>\"That's where the promise of this type of therapy lies. You would expect that the injected lesion would have some type of response because you're disrupting the tumor cells,\" Gnjatic said. \"What would be interesting is if this could prime an immune response that would eventually also take care of the non-injected tumors. That's the holy grail of immunotherapy.\"</p><p>Janku said he's particularly excited by the ability of the bacteria to battle sarcomas, which are cancers that occur in bone, muscle and soft tissues.</p><p>\"Classic immunotherapy which is now approved or being heavily investigated doesn't seem to be working for a majority of sarcomas,\" Janku explained.</p><p>Researchers have moved on to the next phase, in which patients taking the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab (Keytruda) will also be treated with a single injection of <i>Clostridium novyi-NT</i>, Janku said. The researchers suspect the two therapies used in combination will create a strong immune response against cancers.</p><p>However, they will have to keep an eye on potential side effects from <i>Clostridium novyi-NT</i>, Janku added.</p><p>Two patients treated with the heaviest dose of 3 million spores of Clostridium novyi-NT fell ill with sepsis and/or gas gangrene, leading researchers to set the maximum tolerated dose at 1 million spores.</p><p>Researchers also found the bacteria in the bloodstream of a couple of patients, meaning that the infection will need to be carefully tracked, Janku said.</p><p>\"That didn't result in clostridium seeding anywhere else outside the injected region, but it's a theoretical possibility since we were able to detect it in the blood culture of one or two patients,\" Janku said.</p><p>Patients also could be susceptible to immune response side effects, such as low blood pressure or fever, he added.</p><p>The trial results were to be presented Sunday  at the International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference, in New York City. The meeting is jointly sponsored by the Cancer Research Institute, the Association for Cancer Immunotherapy, the European Academy of Tumor Immunology, and the American Association for Cancer Research.</p><p>Research presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Cancer Institute  has more about <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types\" target=\"_new\">cancer treatment</a>.</p>",

She's an assistant professor at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C.</p><p>For the study, the researchers fed female monkeys a high-fat Western diet or a plant-based Mediterranean diet for 2.5 years. They noted this is the rough equivalent of eight human years.</p><p>The monkeys who were fed the Mediterranean diet ended up with a different mix of bacteria in their breast tissue from those fed the Western diet -- a roughly 10-fold increase in mammary gland lactobacillus, the researchers found. </p><p>There's some evidence that this type of bacteria may help inhibit breast cancer tumor growth, the study authors said.

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Oct. 22, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- After a heart attack, your risk for a stroke is elevated longer than previously believed, preliminary results of a new study suggest. </p><p>\"A heart attack is a risk factor for stroke for at least three months,\" said researcher Dr. Alexander Merkler, an assistant professor of neurology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City. </p><p>\"That's big news because all the data we have so far suggests that heart attack is only a risk factor for stroke for one month,\" he said. </p><p>It isn't clear why a heart attack increases stroke risk, Merkler said. It might be that damage to the heart causes clots that can travel to the brain, he said. </p><p>\"These findings will change the way we think of the relationship between heart attack and stroke,\" said Merkler.</p><p>Current practice is to have patients take antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin, after a heart attack. But these new findings suggest that patients might need blood thinners to prevent clots, Merkler said. More studies are needed to see which works best, he added.</p><p>The researchers looked at more than 1.7 million Medicare patients, of whom more than 46,000 were hospitalized for a heart attack and 80,000 for a stroke. The investigators found a higher risk for stroke among patients who'd had a heart attack compared with patients who didn't suffer a heart attack.  </p><p>The greatest risk was in the first month after heart attack patients left the hospital, Merkler said.</p><p>But the risk remained high during the five to 12 weeks after discharge, he added. After 12 weeks, the risk appeared to return to pre-heart attack levels.</p><p>Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a cardiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, said earlier studies have shown that after a heart attack, both men and women are at greater risk for a stroke.</p><p>But, the time when the risk is greatest has not been certain, said Fonarow, who also directs the Ahmanson-UCLA Cardiomyopathy Center. </p><p>This new study finds the greatest risk of stroke is during the first four weeks after hospital discharge, but it persists for 12 weeks regardless of the type of heart attack, he said.</p><p>\"These findings highlight the need to more effectively prevent and treat heart attacks to help mitigate the potential debilitating risk of stroke,\" said Fonarow, who was not involved with the research.</p><p>The study was presented Sunday at a meeting of the American Neurological Association, in Atlanta. Research presented at meetings is usually considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart Association has more on the risks of <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/understand-your-risks-to-prevent-a-heart-attack\" target=\"_new\">heart attack</a>.</p>",

Both steps are considered standard for proper psychiatric care.</p><p>And while some children may be getting medicines they don't need, others may be going without drugs that can help them. Many kids may not be receiving drug therapy that could help them better socialize or concentrate at school, the report found.</p><p>The drugs under review included those used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, PTSD, depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  Foster kids were more prone to receive these meds than kids in the general population, the report found.</p><p>Foster children \"are at greater risk of not getting the medications they need, but equally important, they are at risk of getting powerful medications that they do not need,\" Ann Maxwell, an assistant inspector general, told the <i>AP</i>.</p><p>Poor planning or follow-up can have tragic consequences for children, the report noted. In one case, an 11-year-old boy in foster care was initially placed on two meds after being diagnosed with anxiety, ADHD and other issues. But his foster mother had difficulties getting refills, and when drug therapy lapsed the child began displaying destructive, disruptive behaviors.</p><p>According to the report, the state in which the boy lived had no rules regarding follow-up with foster parents regarding a child's medications.</p><p>The report authors are recommending that the HHS Administration for Children and Families work with states to improve oversight on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Responding to the report, the agency said that it might require additional legal authority to do so.  The care of foster children is the shared responsibility of federal, state and local agencies, the <i>AP</i> noted.</p><p>Complicating the issue is the fact that the well-being of any one foster child is typically divided between foster parents, birth parents, relatives and case workers -- upping the odds that miscommunications between those parties will affect the child's medical care.</p>",

This is an inherited form of disease that leads to dementia at an early age.</p><p>\"The results of this study are encouraging, and not only for individuals with rare genetically caused Alzheimer's disease,\" said Maria Carrillo, chief science officer for the Alzheimer's Association.</p><p>\"If further research confirms this relationship between physical activity and later onset of dementia symptoms in ADAD, then we need to expand the scope of this work to see if it also is true in the millions of people with more common, late-onset Alzheimer's,\" Carrillo said in an association news release.

Some of those who are offered employment may stay longer because they have no other options, and others may feel a sense of loyalty or gratitude to an employer who has given them a second chance,\" she said.</p><p>The researchers cautioned that the study only used data from people working in sales and customer service, which may limit the results to these jobs. In addition, the nature of the study cannot prove if service jobs are the only reason for longer employment.</p><p>Weiss and her colleagues found that employees with criminal records had 34 percent higher odds of misconduct in sales jobs, but not in service jobs. This may mean that employees with criminal records do better and stay longer in customer service jobs than sales jobs.</p><p>Despite the higher misconduct rate, sales employees with a criminal record may be good investments for employers.

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 1, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Social stigma may play a large role in the depression, anxiety and other mental health woes experienced by many people with autism, a small new study indicates.</p><p>British researchers found that 72 percent of the psychological distress reported in 111 adults with autism was linked to social stigma, including discrimination and rejection.</p><p>Many people with autism said they're treated like no one thinks they're smart or that no one will hire someone like them. This kind of stigma can take a toll on the psyche, the researchers said.</p>  <p>\"We already suspected there would be a significant impact of discrimination on the mental health of the autistic population, it's just that no one's really studied the impact of that before,\" said study author Monique Botha. She's a doctoral student and post-graduate researcher at the University of Surrey, in England.</p><p>\"The only thing we were surprised by was how potentially strong a relationship there was,\" added Botha, who has autism. \"To put it colloquially, it blew our minds.\"</p><p>A disorder that can affect communication, social interaction and creative play, autism is diagnosed in about one in every 59 children in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and persist through adulthood.</p><p>Prior research has established that people with an autism spectrum disorder are more prone to anxiety, depression and suicide than the general population. They are also more likely to suffer physical, verbal and sexual abuse, and face workplace harassment and dismissal, according to 01217000000c1gRAAQs.</p><p>Botha and her colleagues conducted an online survey with adults who say they have autism. The researchers used the so-called \"minority stress theory\" to evaluate stressors believed to contribute to lower mental health in stigmatized minority groups, extending that category to those with autism.</p><p>The survey questions touched on six areas of stress, including: victimization and discrimination; \"outness,\" meaning how often those with autism disclose their condition to others; everyday discrimination; expectation of rejection; physical concealment of their condition; and internalized stigma.</p><p>The results indicated that social stress due to stigma also predicted lower levels of emotional, psychological and social well-being in people with autism, Botha said.</p><p>About 6 percent of people in the general population display high rates of psychological distress, compared to more than 50 percent of the study participants, Botha noted. Psychological distress is \"a really good signifier for clinical depression and anxiety,\" she added.</p><p>\"When you actually sit down and talk to autistic people themselves, they say one of the hardest things &hellip; is how people respond to you and how they treat you,\" Botha said. \"We hope this study will help change the way we think about autism and mental health, and make us think long and hard about the way we treat autistic people in society.\"</p><p>Eric Butter is director of the Child Development Center at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, which is part of the Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network.</p><p>He said it makes sense that \"people with autism can still experience discrimination and have areas in their life where they're excluded &hellip; [which] can affect their mental health and well-being.\"</p><p>Butter, who wasn't involved in the new research, said he hopes future studies will be done to \"better understand this finding.\" He was skeptical about the study's use of self-identified people with autism, saying a more rigorous diagnostic process would be optimal for research.</p><p>But \"it's really important to recognize that people with autism are people first. They are just as likely to experience being alienated, separated, lonely, and all the possible consequences of being inappropriately and unfortunately excluded from a social environment,\" Butter said. </p><p>\"When that happens, we should find a way of reacting that supports their social inclusion,\" he added.</p><p>The study was published recently in the journal <i>Society and Mental Health</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/index.html\" target=\"_new\">autism</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Sept. 17, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Despite decades of warnings about the hazards of baby walkers, thousands of toddlers still end up in hospital emergency rooms with walker-related injuries, new research shows.</p><p>The study reported that more than 230,000 children younger than 15 months old were treated in emergency rooms between 1990 and 2014. More than 10,000 of those youngsters ended up being admitted to the hospital.</p><p>\"Baby walkers remain a serious and preventable source of injury to young children and should not be used,\" said senior study author Dr. Gary Smith, director of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. </p><p>\"Baby walkers give quick mobility -- up to 4 feet per second -- to young children before they are developmentally ready,\" he said, stressing, \"there are still too many serious injuries occurring related to this product.\" </p><p>Infant walkers are made for use in young children who can't yet walk. Most injuries occur when a baby in a walker falls down stairs. Walkers also allow children access to things they might not otherwise be able to reach, such as an oven door or toxic household substances, the researchers said.</p><p>Injuries related to walkers include head injuries, such as skull fractures and concussions, burns, poisoning and drowning, the study team noted. </p><p>Stationary activity centers were introduced in 1994. These devices hold baby in a similar upright position, but don't have wheels. Instead, they have different activities within the baby's reach. </p><p>In 1997, a voluntary safety standard required the base of baby walkers to be wider than a standard 36-inch doorway, or to have a device that automatically engages a brake if one of the wheels drops over the edge of a step, the researchers said. Canada banned baby walkers in 2004. </p><p>In 2010, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) issued additional safety standards. These standards made it easier for the CPSC to stop noncomplying imported walkers from entering the marketplace. The American Academy of Pediatrics has called for a ban in the United States but, so far, the devices are still legal. </p><p>The latest study had both good news and bad news. The researchers found that between 1990 and 2003 baby walker injuries went down by 84.5 percent. The number of injuries from falling down stairs dropped by 91 percent. </p><p>During the four years after the 2010 standards were implemented, annual injuries dropped by nearly 23 percent compared to the four years before. </p><p>But of the children injured, 91 percent had a head or neck injury. Nearly three-quarters were hurt after falling down the stairs. </p><p>Smith said parents still underestimate the safety risk these devices pose. </p><p>\"Warning labels and educational campaigns have not been shown to be effective strategies for reducing baby walker-related injuries. Many families still use baby walkers, despite being aware of their potential dangers,\" he said.</p><p>\"Many parents believe baby walkers offer their children entertainment, promote walking, and provide a baby activity while parents are doing something else,\" Smith said. He added that these products do not promote walking. In fact, they may delay mental and motor development, he said.</p><p>But Smith isn't blaming parents for their baby's injuries. \"These are good parents who were carefully supervising their children and using the baby walker as intended. Their only error was that they believed the myth that baby walkers are safe to use.\"</p><p>Dr. Peter Richel, chief of pediatrics at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y., said he wasn't surprised by the findings.</p><p>\"No matter what gates you have or how securely you shut a door, kids still find a way to get around them,\" said Richel, who wasn't involved with the study.</p><p>\"I don't advocate using movable walkers, but if parents can find a safe place for one -- a sunken living room or a finished basement -- then I don't have a problem with them,\" he explained. But Richel said stationary activity centers are preferable and can be good for a child's development.</p><p>The study was published online Sept. 17 in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics has more on what you need to know about <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Baby-Walkers-A-Dangerous-Choice.aspx\" target=\"_new\">baby walkers</a>.</p>",

Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health showed.</p><p>Less often, parents blamed their child's busy schedule. More than 40 percent of the parents surveyed suggested their teens' homework load and activities disrupted their sleep schedule. Meanwhile, 31 percent of parents said worries about school affected their child's ability to sleep, and 23 percent said their teen's concerns about their social life kept them up at night. </p><p>In addition, 10 percent of parents reported that a health condition or medication had a negative effect on their child's sleep habits.</p><p>Many parents reported trying to encourage better sleep. More than half said they suggest limiting caffeine intake in the evening or tell their teen to turn off their phones and other electronic devices at bedtime. More than 40 percent recommend a snack before bed, 36 percent tried natural sleep remedies like melatonin, and 28 percent said their teen has tried a sleep aid.</p><p>But only 4 in 10 parents with sleep-deprived teens said they talked to a doctor about it. </p><p>Those who did bring up the matter with a doctor said they were generally advised to turn off electronics and phones at bedtime, stick to a regular sleep schedule and limit caffeine. Some physicians also suggested trying a natural sleep remedy.</p><p>\"Parents whose teens continue to have frequent sleep problems &hellip; may want to talk with a health care provider, particularly when considering which type of medication to try,\" Clark said. \"Inadequate or disrupted sleep can have long-lasting health effects that go beyond moodiness and irritability for teens.\"</p><p>These include difficulty concentrating in school and an increased risk of auto accidents, Clark said. \"Inadequate sleep has also been linked to health problems ranging from obesity to depression,\" she added.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The American Sleep Association has other information on <a href=\"https://www.sleepassociation.org/blog-post/sleep-and-electronics/\" target=\"_new\"> sleep and electronics</a>.</p>",

They were followed for an average of close to five years.</p><p>Treatment with 100 milligrams of aspirin per day did not affect the chances a person would live longer free from dementia or disability, researchers found.</p><p>In fact, the group taking aspirin had a slightly increased risk of death -- 5.9 percent died compared with 5.2 percent taking a placebo. However, the higher death rate was due to more cancer deaths in the aspirin group, which could have been due to chance, the researchers said.</p><p>More troubling was the fact that people taking daily aspirin suffered clinically significant bleeding.</p><p>Hemorrhagic stroke, bleeding in the brain, gastrointestinal bleeding, or bleeding at other sites that required transfusion or hospitalization occurred in 3.8 percent of people on aspirin versus 2.7 percent of people on placebo.</p><p>\"There's definitely an increased bleeding risk, and it's not benign,\" said Dr. Vincent Bufalino, a cardiologist and spokesman for the American Heart Association. \"The intracranial bleeding risk is obviously a terrible complication.\"</p><p>The clinical trial's results suggest that \"if seniors don't have a valid medical need for taking aspirin, you are unlikely to benefit from it and there are some risks,\" concluded lead researcher John McNeil, head of epidemiology and preventive health at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.</p><p>However, all of the experts agreed that if you're now taking aspirin under a doctor's direction you shouldn't stop until you discuss it with them, regardless of your age.</p><p>\"Many people are taking aspirin for important medical reasons,\" McNeil said. \"It would be unwise to stop without speaking to their doctor about it.\"</p><p>The clinical trial was published online as three papers in the Sept. 16 issue of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has more about <a href=\" https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer \" target=\"_new\">daily low-dose aspirin</a>.</p>",

Often, flash-frozen vegetables retain nutrients better than fresh produce that was trucked to your store and then kept in the fridge for a few days. Green peas are particularly tasty as a side dish, a salad topping and as a healthy sauce when pureed into a pesto.</p><p>Raspberries offer a bounty of nutrients, plus fiber. When fresh ones aren't available or affordable, head for the frozen foods case. In fact, all types of frozen berries and other frozen fruit chunks are great right out of the bag for making thick smoothies.</p><p>Having a package of whole-wheat flatbreads or tortillas in your freezer lets you make low-calorie pizzas and quesadillas.</p><p>A box of 100-percent frozen-fruit bars is perfect to have on hand for a refreshing snack. Just be sure you're getting real fruit with some juice, not flavored water with sweeteners.</p><p>Of course, not everything in the freezer case is healthy or low in calories, especially many frozen meals, so always read labels before you buy.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has more on <a href=\" https://www.eatright.org/food/planning-and-prep/smart-shopping/frozen-foods-convenient-and-nutritious\" target=\"_new\">frozen foods</a> and how to make the best selections.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<!--Spanish ID: 738016 --><p>MONDAY, Sept. 24, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Just a little bit of light exercise can immediately improve a person's memory, new Japanese research suggests.</p><p>How little? The small study involved 36 healthy college-aged men and women and found that just 10 minutes of relaxed cycling on a stationary bike was all it took to improve recall during memory testing conducted right afterwards.</p><p>Why? Brain scans on 16 of the participants indicated that short bouts of mild exercise appeared to trigger an instant uptick in communication between the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the cortical brain regions. Both brain areas are key to processing memory.</p><p>Study author Hideaki Soya characterized the findings as \"striking evidence\" of how a \"very light [exercise] protocol indeed has beneficial effects on brains and cognition.\" He is chair of the Advanced Research Initiative for Human High Performance at the University of Tsukuba in Ibaraki, Japan.</p><p>Soya also said the results are \"good news for people who do not like to exercise,\" including those in poor physical health or older folks.</p><p>And even though the study only measured the exercise dividend among young men and women, Soya stressed that his team's earlier research suggests that mild exercise seems to produce broad results, \"not only with the young, but also with the elderly.\"</p><p>But just how long might the memory affect linger? Soya said it's too soon to say for sure. \"But at this time,\" he added, \"we can say that the exercise effect lasts at least 15 minutes after 10 minutes of exercise.\"</p><p>Soya and his colleagues report their findings in the Sept. 24 issue of the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Science</i>.</p><p>In the study, all participants randomly underwent memory testing twice, once after completing 10 minutes on a stationary bike and once after no exercise of any kind.</p><p>Memory testing began within five minutes following the exercise/no exercise task. Testing initially involved showing each participant images of everyday objects, at which point all were asked to indicate if the object was typically used indoors or outdoors.</p><p>In turn, all were then shown a second round of images and asked to recall if they had been shown the image before, or if the image was similar or entirely new.</p><p>A little less than half of the group had memory testing while also undergoing high-resolution f-MRI brain scans.</p><p>In the end, the research team found that when participants engaged in a short bout of light exercise, there was a \"rapid enhancement\" in their ability to recall information accurately.</p><p>What's more, the scans suggested that the observed enhancement seemed to reflect an increase in \"functional connectivity\" between brain centers critical to memory performance. The more such brain communication went up post-exercise, the more a person's memory skills improved, the investigators said.</p><p>Heather Snyder, senior director of medical and scientific operations with the Alzheimer's Association, said it remains to be seen to how the exercise-enhanced \"brain plasticity\" Soya's team observed among young adults will ultimately play out among seniors.</p><p>\"While there is widespread consensus that physical activity, even in moderation, is beneficial for brain health, less is known about the specific benefits or the biology of how physical activity works in our brains,\" said Snyder, who wasn't involved with the research.</p><p>\"The current findings are intriguing, because they suggest physical activity may improve memory,\" she acknowledged. And the AA makes a point of advising seniors to stay active, noting that \"physical activity is a valuable part of any overall body wellness plan and is associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline.\"</p><p>Still, Snyder stressed that \"an important next step is replicating the study in older adults to see if the same results are achieved.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on the importance of exercise among seniors at the <a href=\"https://www.alz.org/help-support/brain_health/stay_physically_active/\" target=\"_new\">Alzheimer's Association</a>.</p>",

Wesley Ely.</p><p>He's professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, in Nashville, Tenn.</p><p>\"Every day, there are many thousands of patients receiving unnecessary antipsychotics in the critical care setting that are bringing risk and cost without benefit,\" Ely said in a university news release.</p><p>Delirium affects more than 7 million hospitalized Americans a year. It can occur in patients of any age, but is more common among older adults who have a major illness -- especially involving ICU care -- or who have major surgery.</p><p>Antipsychotic medications have been used to treat delirium in ICU patients for 40 years. But the new study \"suggests the need to reexamine that practice,\" said Dr. Marie Bernard, deputy director of the U.S. National Institute on Aging, which funded the study. She spoke in an agency news release.</p><p>In the new study,  Ely's team tracked outcomes for 566 ICU patients treated at 16 U.S. medical centers. All of the patients developed delirium and were given either intravenous haloperidol, ziprasidone or a placebo (saline). The patients had a wide range of ages and conditions.</p><p>The researchers observed no significant difference between the three groups in duration of delirium or coma, and no significant differences in 30-day or 90-day death rates, or in time spent on a ventilator, in the ICU, or in the hospital.</p><p>There was no evidence that the antipsychotics caused major harm to any patients. However, other studies have found that the drugs do come with risks and are tied to a higher risk of stroke, pneumonia, balance problems and falls in elderly patients.</p><p>Dr. Mark Astiz directs critical care medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He said that \"patients who are being treated for life-threatening diseases frequently develop a delirium, which is complicated by agitation and behavioral changes.\"</p><p>The new findings are \"consistent with earlier smaller clinical trials suggesting that [antipsychotics] should not be routinely used for this indication in critically ill patients,\" Astiz said.</p><p>The study was published online Oct. 22 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Library of Medicine has more on <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000740.htm\" target=\"_new\">delirium</a>.</p>",

It found that black patients were 24 percent less likely than white patients to receive an antiplatelet drug that wasn't aspirin. They were 9 percent less likely to get medication to reduce their level of lipids, fats in the blood.</p> <p>Black patients also had a 29 percent lower chance of getting an angiogram, an imaging technique used to see inside the heart's blood vessels, and were 45 percent less likely to undergo more aggressive therapy such as bypass surgery or angioplasty.</p> <p>The study only looked at heart attacks in which an artery was partially blocked, partially reducing blood flow. It excluded heart attacks in which a coronary artery is completely obstructed.</p> <p>Some of the study's findings provided hints about why racial differences in care have continued over the years. For example, the study found black patients are more likely than their white counterparts to smoke and have chronic illnesses such as diabetes and kidney disease in addition to their heart problems.</p> <p>\"If physicians see you as a high-risk patient, you might not benefit from all of these traditional therapies because they might be considered too aggressive for you,\" Arora said.</p> <p>The study also found that black patients were younger, more often women, and less likely to have medical insurance than white patients.</p> <p>The findings point to a need to have more voices join the conversation about disparities in patient care and the strategies necessary to achieve health equity, said Dr. Ivor Benjamin, president of the American Heart Association.</p> <p>\"These kinds of studies are extremely important if only that they get the attention of and can be viewed by policymakers, health care systems and providers,\" he said. The study also shows the need for early awareness and intervention in the black population to help chip away at some of the multiple risk factors they are more prone to have at younger ages.</p> <p>\"Diabetes, hypertension -- those kinds of factors may conspire to drive clinical presentation much earlier in blacks compared to whites,\" said Benjamin, director of the Cardiovascular Center at the Medical College of Wisconsin. \"What this says is that we need to continue to intensify our efforts at primary prevention while incorporating shared decision-making between providers and patients, especially at points of care using high-complexity interventions.\"</p> <p>For example, new AHA guidelines issued last November redefined high blood pressure as 130/80, versus the previous 140/90. That change of 10 millimeters of mercury was enough to classify nearly half of all Americans as having high blood pressure, which is particularly prevalent among black Americans.</p> <p>Arora agreed that emphasizing efforts to help black patients reduce their number of co-existing chronic illnesses could make the biggest difference.</p> <p>\"We should aim at reducing the cardiovascular risk factors in these patients,\" he said. \"I think that's where one of the main problems lie and that's where the interventions have to be made to eventually reduce disparities in these patients.\"</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 2, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Obese kids may have extra difficulty with schoolwork and coping under stress, a preliminary study suggests.</p><p>In a survey of nearly 23,000 parents, researchers found that kids who were obese were less likely to show certain indicators of \"flourishing,\" versus their normal-weight peers.</p><p>That meant less engagement in schoolwork and learning, and more difficulty coping with challenging situations.</p><p>The findings do not necessarily prove that childhood obesity feeds those problems, researchers said.</p><p>But they add to evidence of the possible \"psychosocial\" effects of obesity, said Dr. Christopher Bolling, who chairs the American Academy of Pediatrics' obesity section.</p><p>\"Studies have shown that people with obesity tend to report lower quality of life, face more social stigma and have higher rates of depression,\" said Bolling, who was not involved in the new research.</p><p>So it's not surprising, added Bolling, that obese children in this study were not flourishing to the degree that their peers were.</p><p>However, \"none of this means that people need to lose weight in order to be happy,\" he stressed.</p><p>In fact, Bolling said, when obese kids face social stigma and other emotional difficulties, that \"says something about our society.\"</p> <p>Dr. Natasha Gill, of Brown University and Hasbro Children's Hospital in Providence, R.I., led the study.</p><p>She said that when it comes to the issue of childhood obesity, attention often goes toward the potential long-term physical health effects -- such as asthma and type 2 diabetes. But, she said, obesity can also have \"an immediate impact\" on kids' well-being.</p><p>In this case, Gill and her team focused on five specific markers of \"flourishing.\" They surveyed 22,914 parents and caregivers of kids ages 10 to 17, asking them whether their child:</p><ul><li>\"Shows interest and curiosity in learning new things,\"</li><li>\"Works to finish tasks he or she starts,\" </li> <li>\"Stays calm and in control when faced with a challenge,\"</li> <li>\"Cares about doing well in school,\"</li><li>\"Does all required homework.\"</li></ul><p>Overall, nearly 28 percent of obese kids were reported to show all five markers of flourishing -- versus 39 percent of normal-weight kids and 37 percent of overweight children.</p><p>According to Gill, kids who were obese did tend to spend more time on digital media and get less sleep. But even when the researchers accounted for those differences -- as well as family poverty and parents' education levels -- obesity itself was still linked to lower odds of flourishing.</p><p>\"There is a clear negative relationship between obesity and markers of flourishing,\" Gill said. But, she noted, \"it's difficult to know which came first.\"</p><p>Bolling agreed that there's a \"chicken-and-egg\" question. For instance, it's possible that kids who are ostracized or disengaged at school are more likely to gain weight excessively.</p><p>Gill was scheduled to present the findings Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Pediatrics, in Orlando, Fla. In general, studies released at meetings are considered preliminary until they're published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>For now, Gill and Bolling recommended that adults be aware that obese kids can face more challenges at school, and with coping skills.</p> <p>\"Kids manifest stress in different ways,\" Bolling noted. \"It can turn up as physical symptoms, difficulties with relationships, or poorer school performance.\"</p><p>Gill suggested parents regularly sit down with their kids to simply have conversations and check in on how they are doing.</p><p>She said research shows that flourishing markers seem to be similar to personality traits: They stay the same over time. So if children do not develop them, Gill said, that could affect them into adulthood.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics has more on <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/obesity/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_new\">childhood obesity</a>.</p>",

And while it sounds counter-intuitive,  exercise gives you more energy -- it feeds on itself in a good way. Researchers at the University of Georgia found that healthy but sedentary adults who did as little as 20 minutes of low-to-moderate cardio (think brisk walking) three days a week felt more energized after just a few weeks.</p><p>\"I don't have time to exercise.\" Who doesn't feel squeezed by a busy schedule? And yes, driving back and forth to the gym can double the time you need to allot to a workout. So skip the trip and invest in home equipment. But still can't find a 30-minute block of time? Break up your workout into a few short segments a day. Steal 10 to 15 minutes before the kids wake up and another 15 after they go to sleep.</p><p>\"I'm too out of shape to exercise.\" Being out of shape is no reason to sit on the sidelines and <i>stay</i> out of shape. Fitness can start with just one step. If you're unhappy with your appearance, work out at home at first or invest in exercise clothes that flatter you. Set small, realistic goals that you can build on. Begin with 5 minutes of walking and focus on the present, not the 30 minutes you hope to accomplish. Praise yourself for getting started, rather than berate yourself for not having Olympic fitness status.</p><p>Keep the momentum going by rewarding yourself with fitness-related items such as a high-tech monitor or watch or new exercise clothes as your size decreases.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Council on Exercise has great tips to <a href=\" https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/lifestyle/blog/6589/exercise-as-a-cure-for-fatigue-and-to-boost-energy-levels\" target=\"_new\">help you overcome excuses</a> and boost your energy level through fitness.</p>",

Opioids are playing a major role in the violence, doctors said.</p><p>Half of emergency physicians reported that at least half of all assaults are committed by people who are either seeking drugs or under the influence of drugs or alcohol, the poll found.</p><p>\"They go to the emergency department hoping to get some relief, from not just the pain but the symptoms of withdrawal,\" Friedman explained. \"These folks are agitated, they're desperate and they don't really have anywhere to turn.\"</p><p>Efforts to curb the opioid epidemic require doctors to check prescription databases for potential misuse of painkillers, said Dr. Teresa Murray Amato. She is chair of emergency medicine at Long Island Jewish Forest Hills in Forest Hills, N.Y.</p><p>\"This can lead to difficult conversations and at times outright threats to the physician when the physician denies the request,\" Amato said. </p><p>\"Personally, I have noticed over the past year that, on almost every shift, I have been confronted by violence or the threat of violence when I attempt to redirect a patient away from opiate prescriptions,\" she added. \"In the past, these kinds of situations were much less frequent.\"</p><p>Nearly all (97 percent) of the assaults were committed by patients, doctors said, although about 28 percent also involved a patient's family member or friend.</p><p> Friedman explained that \"you have people who are in a crisis, and they show up, and we kind of live in a McDonald's world. People want it hot and want it now, and want it exactly as they want it, and we can't always provide that.\"</p><p>And, Friedman added, \"We also live in a world where it seems to be increasingly OK to express your anger. For some folks, that leads to them being particularly violent.\"</p><p>But patients  are also paying the price for this continued violence.</p><p>About 80 percent of doctors said violence in the emergency department has harmed patient care, and about half said patients have been physically harmed while seeking ER treatment.</p><p>These assaults keep emergency department physicians and staff from performing effectively, inflict emotional trauma and anxiety on patients, and increase wait times for treatment, doctors said.</p><p> Dr. Robert Glatter is an emergency physician with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He said, \"Physical and verbal attacks on emergency department staff can lead to long-term psychological effects, including anxiety as well as PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder]. Not only is patient care disrupted, but time devoted to critical emergencies is diverted to address these incidents.\" </p><p>Assaults on emergency physicians most often involved hitting or slapping (44 percent), spitting on them (30 percent), punching them (28 percent), kicking them (27 percent) or scratching them (17 percent), the findings showed.</p><p>Part of the problem is that people who carry out an assault in an emergency department rarely face consequences, Friedman said.</p><p>The poll found that nearly seven in 10 doctors said their hospital reported the incident to police. But hospital security only pressed charges in 3 percent of those cases, and hospital administrations advised doctors to press charges in only 6 percent of cases.</p><p>\"I've been assaulted a number of times in the emergency department and every time it's happened the hospital asked me to not press charges,\" Friedman said. \"If we don't press charges, we're telling our caregivers in the emergency department that it's OK for people to assault you, and it's not.\"</p><p>Hospitals also need to step up security measures, including more security guards and even metal detectors for some emergency departments, Friedman said.</p><p>\"Hospitals need to understand that the emergency department is a place that's open to the world,\" he added.</p><p>Friedman also would like to see tougher penalties for those who attack emergency department staff.</p><p>\"If a caregiver is assaulted, the penalties for that should be the same as if you're assaulting a police officer or firefighter,\" Friedman said.</p><p>More than 3,500 emergency physicians across the nation were surveyed for the poll. The results were scheduled for  presentation Tuesday at the ACEP's annual meeting in San Diego.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Emergency Nurses Association has more about <a href=\"https://www.ena.org/practice-resources/workplace-violence\" target=\"_new\"> violence in the emergency department</a>.</p>",

He's an assistant professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City.</p><p>\"These are very sick patients who need close follow-up,\" Smilowitz said in a hospital news release.</p><p>The researchers analyzed data from more than 61,400 people hospitalized with broken heart syndrome. They found that 12 percent were rehospitalized within 30 days of discharge. Of those, nearly 4 percent died after readmission.</p><p>Among heart attack patients, the rates were 17 percent and 7 percent, respectively, according to the study. </p><p>\"Our findings show that Takotsubo syndrome still presents considerable risk to patients after they're initially discharged from the hospital,\" said senior investigator Dr. Harmony Reynolds, an associate professor of medicine at NYU Langone.</p><p>\"Even though the heart muscle recovers full function in survivors, there are lasting effects on the body. Physicians should monitor Takotsubo patients carefully,\" Reynolds said.</p><p>The researchers noted that the most common cause of hospital readmission among patients with broken heart syndrome was heart failure. It was diagnosed in 11 percent of broken heart syndrome patients and in 13 percent of heart attack patients.</p><p>The study also found that compared to heart attack patients, broken heart syndrome patients were younger and more likely to be women. They also had fewer risk factors for heart disease, such as diabetes and obesity, but were more likely to have other non-cardiac illnesses such as depression, rheumatoid arthritis, or chronic pulmonary disease.</p><p>The findings were published online Oct. 2 in the <i> European Heart Journal--Quality of Care and Clinical Outcomes</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart Association has more on <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cardiomyopathy/what-is-cardiomyopathy-in-adults/is-broken-heart-syndrome-real\" target=\"_new\">broken heart syndrome</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Sept. 17, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Modern psychology largely rejects the notion that people can be pigeonholed into personality types.</p><p>But that assumption is being challenged by a major new study, which discovered at least four distinct personality types into which people tend to cluster.</p><p>Researchers discovered these clusters by running the results of 1.5 million personality inventory questionnaires through a computer, said lead researcher Martin Gerlach. He is a doctoral student at Northwestern University, in Evanston, Ill.</p><p>The questionnaires assessed each person on five well-established personality traits: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness.</p><p>Gerlach and his team fed these into the computer to see if people would tend to cluster around similar levels of shared personality traits.</p><p>The investigators found at least four clusters, which they compared to \"lumps in the batter,\" Gerlach said.</p><p>The first is the \"Average\" personality type, which is characterized by average scores in all traits, the researchers said.</p><p>The other three clusters are roughly organized along the traits of neuroticism (level of emotional stability) and extraversion (the quality of being outgoing):</p><ul><li>\"Reserved\" personalities are emotionally stable but not particularly extraverted. They also are somewhat agreeable and conscientious.</li><li>\"Self-Centered\" personalities score high in extraversion and below average in openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness. \"It's not very nice to interact with these kinds of people,\" Gerlach said.</li><li>\"Role Models\" are low in neuroticism and high in all the other traits. They are agreeable, thoughtful and well-organized.</li></ul><p>These clusters were found thanks to four large data sets comprising more than a million people, obtained from different studies performed around the world, Gerlach noted.</p><p>\"It was previously unthinkable to obtain this amount of data,\" Gerlach said.</p><p>Not everyone will fall into one of these personality types, he added, and some people may even fall somewhere in the middle between two of them.</p><p>Your specific personality type is not set in stone, either, he explained.</p><p>For example, researchers speculate that the younger you are, the more likely you will be to fall within the Self-Centered category, particularly if you're a teenage boy, Gerlach said.</p><p>But with age and seasoning, a good number of these people could evolve into Role Models.</p><p>\"We would expect people to move from one personality type to another personality type,\" Gerlach said. \"The chances are that older people are more likely to be close to the Role Model personality type. You could describe these people as 'nice' people.\"</p><p>The discovery of these clusters runs counter to much of current psychological theory, which has concluded that personality categories don't exist, the study authors said.</p><p> Senior researcher Luis Nunes Amaral is a professor of chemical and biological engineering at Northwestern Engineering. \"Personality types only existed in self-help literature, and did not have a place in scientific journals. Now, we think this will change because of this study,\" he said in a university news release.</p><p>These clusters could help people predict how well you'll succeed in a given job, or your vulnerability to certain mental or emotional disorders, Gerlach said.</p><p>Psychologists have greeted that notion -- and these new findings -- with some skepticism, however.</p><p> James Maddux, a professor emeritus of psychology with George Mason University, said, \"I have no qualms about the methodology and statistics, but I have serious doubts about the clinical utility of yet another instrument that categorizes people into types.\" Maddux was not involved with the study.</p><p>\"For 40 years or more, clinical psychology has been moving away from using the assessment of personality traits and types to inform treatment and increasingly toward using assessments of people's problematic thoughts, feelings and behaviors as they occur in specific problematic situations, which is the essence of cognitive-behavioral therapy,\" Maddux said.</p><p>\"I doubt that many clinical psychology doctoral programs in the U.S. or Canada would add this instrument to their course or courses on psychological assessment,\" he added.</p><p>But New York City psychiatrist Dr. Timothy Sullivan said, \"Given the numbers of subjects they assessed, it suggests we need take this seriously. There is something meaningful here.\"</p><p>However, it's not clear how useful these categories will be in dealing with people's mental health issues, said Sullivan, chair of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Staten Island University Hospital.</p><p>\"I think the question for us in psychiatry is, is it meaningful to us clinically?\" Sullivan said. \"Does it help us to think about how we might help people who have problems coping in life? In that regard, we would need to play around with these categories and see whether or not they represent something meaningful in a clinical setting.\"</p><p>The study was published Sept. 17 in the journal <i>Nature Human Behavior</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Psychological Association has more about <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/topics/personality/\" target=\"_new\">personality</a>.</p>",

But the drug -- which had sales of more than $12 billion in 2017 -- also comes with a warning for a higher risk of cancer and severe, potentially lethal infections.</p><p>According to the lawsuit, AbbVie footed the bill for physicians' meals, drinks and travel, all in an effort to induce them to write more Humira prescriptions.</p><p>Nurses were also involved in the scheme, the lawsuit alleges. According to Jones' agency, AbbVie would send nurses to the homes of patients already taking Humira. Once there, the nurses would present themselves as an extension of the prescribing doctor's office, but in reality they were planted in patients' homes to dissuade or block concerns or complaints regarding Humira.</p><p>Doctors benefited from the \"free\"nurses, as well, Jones said, noting that the nurses often took care of cumbersome paperwork for physicians.</p><p>\"If given the choice between two medications, one which comes with free nurses and administrative staff and another that requires the provider to pay professional salaries, the provider cannot but help factor the substantial nursing kickback into their prescribing calculus,\" the lawsuit said.  The state's lawsuit is based on testimony provided by an AbbVie nurse, the <i>AP</i> noted.</p><p>In the meantime, insurance companies in California shelled out more than $1.2 billion for Humira for thousands of patients in the state between 2013 and mid-2018.</p><p>But AbbVie called the charges \"without merit.\"</p><p>\"AbbVie operates in compliance with the many state and federal laws that govern interactions with health care providers and patients,\" the company's statement said.</p><p>As for the nursing care it provides, AbbVie said that this is given to help educate patients and help with therapy and \"in no way replace or interfere with interactions between patients and their health care providers.\"</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Sept. 17, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- E-cigarettes are fast becoming a clever way for American teens to use pot, with a new survey showing that nearly a third of high school e-cig users have vaped marijuana.</p><p>The survey involved nearly 20,700 middle and high school students from both public and private institutions. The goal was to gain fresh insight into vaping, which has been the most popular means for smoking among American youth since 2014.</p><p>One of every 11 students overall said he or she had ever used marijuana in an e-cigarette.</p><p>\"That equates to more than 2 million youth who have ever used cannabis in an e-cigarette,\" noted lead investigator Katrina Trivers. She is a lead epidemiologist in the office on smoking and health with the U.S. National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Among those who said they have ever used an e-cigarette at all, 1 in 3 high schoolers and 1 in 4 middle schoolers said they had used pot by vaping it.</p><p>Trivers said the findings point to seemingly dramatic shifts underway in how and what teens smoke.</p><p>\"Although we've seen considerable declines in the use of regular cigarettes among U.S. youth over the past several decades, the tobacco product landscape is evolving, and the use of other tobacco products has become increasingly popular,\" she said.</p><p>For example, Trivers noted that e-cigarette use shot up by 900 percent between 2011 and 2015 among American high schoolers, before declining somewhat in 2016 and holding steady in 2017.</p><p>\"This high rate of cannabis use in e-cigarettes is a public health concern, because any form of tobacco product use is unsafe among youth, irrespective of whether it's smoked, smokeless or electronic,\" she stressed.</p><p>On that front, Trivers pointed out that National Academies of Science has stated that pot use among youth \"can adversely affect learning and memory, and may impair later academic achievement and education.\"</p><p>More broadly, she noted that the U.S. Surgeon General \"has concluded that the aerosol emitted from e-cigarettes is not harmless,\" based on its nicotine and chemical compound content.</p><p>Trivers explained that e-cigarettes heat liquid compounds to create a vapor that contains nicotine, flavorings and other additives, which users inhale.</p><p>By simply adding hash oils, waxes and other liquids that contain pot's active ingredient directly into the e-liquid section, teens can turn an e-cig into a pot-delivery device.</p><p>Trivers noted that the survey found that pot vaping was \"significantly higher\" among boys. It was also more common among high schoolers.</p><p>\"Use was also higher among those who had used e-cigarettes more recently and more frequently,\" she added, as well as among students who said they use other tobacco products and/or live with someone who uses tobacco products.</p><p>Regardless, the researchers concluded that the survey showed pot use in e-cigs is as popular -- or perhaps more popular -- than believed.</p> <p>The findings were published online Sept. 17 as a letter to the editor in the journal <i>JAMA Pediatrics</i>.</p><p>Going forward, Trivers said the focus should be on \"ensuring that youth are aware of the risks of using all forms of tobacco products, including e-cigarettes,\" and on regulating e-cigarettes in the same manner as other tobacco products.</p><p>But Richard Miech, principal investigator of the \"Monitoring the Future\" project for the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research, believes that e-cig use among adolescents will continue to rise in the coming year.</p><p>Still, on a positive note, he pointed to the warning issued last week by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that threatened to take vaping devices off the market if manufacturers don't find ways to stem adolescent use.</p><p>\"This is a forceful step that will hopefully reduce adolescents' access to these devices,\" Miech said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more information on electronic cigarettes at the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/Labeling/ProductsIngredientsComponents/ucm456610.htm\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Sept. 17, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- As deadly fentanyl is increasingly mixed into heroin and other street drugs, some drug abusers are getting smart, a new study finds.</p><p>Fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, has triggered a sharp increase in overdose deaths over the past few years. The drug is to blame for 44 percent of overdose deaths in New York City alone, according to New York University researchers.</p> <p>Now, at least some drug users in the city are adjusting their behavior to avoid overdosing, according to interviews with addicts.</p><p>\"Nearly all study participants were knowledgeable about minimizing their risk for overdose and many reported using methods to reduce their risk,\" said study lead author Courtney McKnight, a clinical assistant professor at NYU College of Global Public Health. </p><p>Still, most users \"were not consistent in applying these methods\" each time they got high, McKnight said.</p><p>In the survey, 55 drug users were interviewed at three needle exchange programs in New York City. Many voiced apprehension about using drugs that could contain fentanyl.</p><p>Some said they had begun using \"test shots\" -- initially injecting a small amount of a drug to assess its strength. Some said they use test shots every time they inject drugs. Others do so only when they suspect the drug was cut with fentanyl, the researchers explained.</p><p>A few programs distribute fentanyl test strips to avoid life-threatening overdoses, and users said they were trying them, too.</p><p>More than two-thirds of the drug users carried naloxone, a medication used to reverse opioid overdoses, at least half of the time.</p><p>Several participants said they had either used naloxone to revive someone else or had the drug administered to them.  </p><p>A few said they turned to drugs less often since the surge in fentanyl-fueled overdoses.</p><p>\"Using methods to reduce the risk of overdose was often complicated by structural factors such as stigma, poverty and homelessness, which were further complicated by dependence and the increased prevalence of fentanyl,\" McKnight said in an NYU news release.</p><p>There is not one approach that will prevent overdose deaths among hundreds of thousands of drug users. But the researchers stressed all strategies should be used to help save lives.</p><p>Supervised injection sites, like those New York City plans to open, are another method that can prevent overdose deaths, said study co-author Don Des Jarlais, a professor of epidemiology. \"These sites provide a medically supervised space with readily available naloxone, sterile injecting equipment, and safe disposal of used syringes,\" he said.</p><p>The study was published recently in the <i>International Journal of Drug Policy</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse provides more facts about <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates\" target=\"_new\">overdose death rates</a>.</p>",

Color indicates a vegetable's unique group of nutrients, so you need orange carrots, leafy greens, purple eggplant and so on.</p><p>Fruit is a great way to satisfy a sweet craving. Just choose whole fruit rather than juice to get all its nutrition, including fiber.</p><p>Beans and other legumes -- such as chickpeas, black-eyed peas and red lentils -- are versatile carb powerhouses with a punch of protein, too.</p><p>Healthy whole grains also deserve a place in your diet. Whole wheat breads and pastas, rolled oats, rye, barley and quinoa have the nutrients that refined white flour products are missing. Ditto on replacing white rice with more wholesome brown rice varieties.</p><p>Beware of other starches, primarily white potatoes. They don't even count as a vegetable on Harvard University's Healthy Eating Plate because they're high in the type of carb that the body digests quickly, resulting in a blood sugar and insulin surge, then dip -- just like soda and candy. People also typically eat them in a fat-filled form, such as chips or fries, or mashed with tons of butter.</p><p>Replace them with sweet potatoes, but go easy on portion size and don't load them with added sugar and fat.

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 1, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Price Woodward was the picture of health at age 52. He lived an active lifestyle and ran marathons. He was definitely not the type of person you'd expect to have a stroke. </p><p>But one night, his wife, Tammy, heard a strange noise coming from the other side of the bed. She turned on the light and Price started talking to her, but she couldn't understand what he was saying. </p><p>Tammy could tell something wasn't right, so she called 911. But because Price had the stroke in his sleep and his wife had no way of knowing exactly when the stroke began, he wasn't eligible for clot-busting medication that can sometimes stop a stroke before much damage is done. </p><p>\"His stroke was really bad. It affected the left side of his body, and he couldn't even sit up. If I hadn't been home, I think he would've died. It's been a long road to recovery,\" Tammy said. </p><p>But Price, who lives in Greensboro, Ga., had a lot of motivation to go through stroke rehabilitation to get better. His middle daughter got engaged after he'd had the stroke, and he was determined to be there for her wedding day. </p><p>\"I told my therapist I was going to walk her down the aisle,\" he said.</p><p>Stroke therapy is very specific, tailored rehab. Tammy explained that even though Price started rehabilitation in a wheelchair, his therapist helped him achieve the goal of walking. She calculated how many steps it would be, how his gait might affect his balance, and even considered how the train of the dress would play into his walking down the aisle. </p><p>Lots of hard work paid off. Not only did Price escort his middle daughter down the aisle, he was also able to attend his youngest daughter's graduation and welcome his oldest daughter's first child. </p><p>But as far as he's come in recovery, Price knows that if he could have gotten help faster, things might have been very different. </p><p>A friend of his also had a stroke, but it happened in front of the friend's family. His friend was able to get to the hospital right away and received the clot-buster drug called TPA. His friend was essentially back to normal in four months, Price said. </p><p>In comparison, Price is still recovering from his stroke four years later. </p><p>\"If you see someone having a stroke, make a note of what time it is,\" he advised, because doctors will want to know what time the symptoms began. </p><p>Dr. Olajide Williams, director of acute stroke services at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, agreed that acting quickly can save lives. An easy way to remember what to look out for is the acronym FAST: </p><ul><li><b>F</b> is for face. If one half of the face droops when you ask someone to smile or show their teeth, that person may be having a stroke.</li><li><b>A</b> is for arm. Ask the person to raise both arms. If someone is having a stroke, one arm won't go up at all or may not go up as much and then goes down quickly. </li><li><b>S</b> is for speech. Talking gibberish or slurring words might be a sign of a stroke. </li><li><b>T</b> is for time to call 911. \"Time is brain. Every minute that a stroke is allowed to continue, you lose 2 million brain cells. The more brain cells that die, the less the chance is for reversing the stroke with treatment,\" Williams said. </li></ul><p>There's usually a three-hour window from the time stroke symptoms begin until you can receive treatment with TPA, or in certain cases, 4.5 hours. With endovascular (blood vessel) treatments, you have six hours from the first symptoms, Williams said. </p> <p>Don't try to drive yourself to the hospital, he said. \"The call to 911 is critical. It bypasses any waiting. The ambulance notifies the hospital and that activates the hospital system and stroke team,\" he added. </p><p>Williams also cautioned not to think you're immune from stroke if you're younger. He said strokes are occurring in younger people, especially in communities with more obesity and diabetes. </p><p>Like Price, Williams wants people to know there is life after stroke. \"Even if an individual doesn't receive acute treatment, rehabilitation can improve function and accelerate recovery,\" Williams said. </p><p>More than 7 million Americans aged 20 and older have had a stroke, according to the American Stroke Association. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about FAST and spotting a stroke from the <a href=\"https://www.strokeassociation.org/STROKEORG/WarningSigns/Stroke-Warning-Signs-and-Symptoms_UCM_308528_SubHomePage.jsp\" target=\"_new\">American Stroke Association</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Sept. 17, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- True to its storm-of-the-century hype, Hurricane Florence pounded the Carolinas with historic rainfall and catastrophic flooding -- and continuing danger looms in its wake.</p><p>Infection and injury are the big threats as cleanup begins, and experts say it's important to be smart as you tackle the dirty work.</p><p>\"The 'it's-not-going-to-happen-to-me' attitude is what gets people killed and injured,\" said Dr. Ryan Stanton, a critical care specialist and spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians. \"The assumption everybody has to make is that everything is sharp and everything is contaminated.\"</p><p>Be aware of the potential risks, wear protective gear and ask for help if you need it, health experts advise. </p><p>In particular, you should leave the work to others if your immune system is compromised, either by underlying disease or because you are taking immunosuppressants. And know your limits: If you've never used power tools such as a chain saw, get help from someone who knows what they're doing. </p><p> Dr. Luis Ostrosky is a professor at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth in Houston and a fellow of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. He said that \"it's important to clean up as soon as possible, but also to be as safe as possible.\" </p><p>Stanton and Ostrosky offer these tips for a safe storm recovery: </p><ul><li><b>Beware hidden dangers in the water:</b> Floodwater is full of nasty stuff -- from untreated sewage and livestock waste to venomous bugs and snakes. The longer water sits, the more germ-laden it gets. Avoid contact with it and wash up thoroughly with soap and water after you work. If you accidentally ingest contaminated water, your risk of infection is high. See a doctor if you develop any symptoms, especially a high fever and jaundice, signs of a potentially deadly disease called leptospirosis, Ostrosky said.</li><li><b>Watch out for electrical hazards:</b> Standing water can be electrically charged if live wires are beneath it. Never enter floodwaters or a dwelling that is flooded without knowing for certain that the power has been shut off either at the house or at the neighborhood level. Call an electrician if you aren't sure.</li><li><b>Take steps to avoid insect bites:</b> Remove standing water to eliminate breeding grounds for mosquitoes, which spread serious illnesses like West Nile virus and encephalitis. Be aware that ant colonies may be present in floodwater. Their bites can cause a life-threatening allergic reaction. </li><li><b>Gear up:</b> Wear heavy gloves, closed-toe (preferably steel-toe) shoes, long sleeves and pants, as well as eye protection. If fecal contamination is likely, wear rubber boots and rubber gloves. If you're working around mold, you'll need an N-95 mask or heavy-duty respirator. </li><li><b>Tool safety is key:</b> After storms, emergency rooms see a lot of injuries caused by power tools -- especially chain saws. \"If you don't have a lot of experience with power tools, you have to be extra careful,\" Stanton said. Make sure your chain saw is the right size for the job, follow directions for its use and beware of kickback. That's an uncontrolled reaction caused when the blade hits metal or wood that can cause serious injury. </li><li><b>Keep hydrated:</b> As you work, drink plenty of water, take frequent breaks and avoid working in the heat of the day. </li><li><b>Have a buddy:</b> If you are going to do significant repair work or have medical problems, make sure someone knows where you are and what you're doing so help can be summoned if needed.</li><li><b>Debris can be dangerous:</b> Watch your step around broken glass and wood, rusty nails and fallen or weakened branches. Remember that trees uproot easily in saturated ground. When cutting trees or branches that are bent or caught on something else, avoid contact with power lines and take extra care. </li><li><b>Wound care is urgent:</b> Falls from ladders and rooftops often happen during cleanup, but cuts and scrapes are the most common post-storm injuries. Tend to them quickly, washing and disinfecting wounds. If signs of infection such as redness or pus develop, seek medical attention, Ostrosky said. If you get injured and haven't had a tetanus shot in more than five years, the doctor will likely recommend one.</li><li><b>Prevent mold:</b> Record rainfall means mold. \"If not properly treated afterwards, you have potentially years of long-term exposure to mold,\" Stanton said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends removing saturated drywall and insulation as soon as possible to reduce the health risk. Open doors and windows and use fans to circulate air. Toss anything you can't clean or dry quickly, and clean wet surfaces, using a mixture of 1 cup household bleach to 1 gallon water. </li></ul><p>\"Understand that there are going to be risks and dangers,\" Stanton said, \"and that these are going to evolve over time. Just be safe.\"</p><p> Ostrosky added, \"You will get through this.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more disaster cleanup tips, visit the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/cleanup/facts.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

It's easier to stick to a schedule when you ink it in your calendar. Even if you can get there only two or three times a week, make the commitment -- being consistent is the only way to get results.</p><p>Another mistake is not adjusting exercise equipment to your size and your abilities. That means small but important changes like moving the seat and back positions on weight machines for the best positioning. That's just as necessary as moving the pin on the weight stack. If not, you're likely to use bad form, and that can lead to injuries.</p><p>Speaking of form, take advantage of the availability of gym staff to make sure you're using correct form, whether in a yoga class or strength training. A trainer's objective eye can help you move through your full range of motion.</p><p>Resist getting into a competition with other gym members, even if it's only in your head. Embrace the spirit of camaraderie so that you can motivate each other.</p><p>Avoid settling into a predictable pattern. One advantage of a gym is the variety it offers, from equipment to classes. So don't get locked into a \"forever\" routine. That can erode your motivation and lead to fitness plateaus and even an overuse injury.</p><p>Finally, don't forget good gym manners.

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Sept. 17, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Tapping into the technology behind facial recognition programs and self-driving cars, researchers in a new study have taught computers key elements of assessing echocardiograms.</p><p>The advance might simplify an otherwise extensive process now done by humans.</p>    <p>Researchers created algorithms to recognize images and potential heart problems that echocardiograms commonly capture, including enlarged chambers, diminished pumping function and even some uncommon diseases.</p>    <p>The computers accurately identified thousands of echocardiogram images and came up with measurements on them that were \"comparable with or superior to manual measurements,\" according to authors of the study, published Monday in the journal <i>Circulation</i>.</p>    <p>Echocardiograms help doctors evaluate heart function by using sound waves to create snapshots of every part of the organ. Because they don't give off radiation and can be given easily in a medical office, they're a popular imaging choice to diagnose heart disease. But, Dr. Rahul Deo, the study's senior author, said they're not done enough because the process of assessing results is long and taxing.</p>    <p>\"It can be tedious to collect everything and interpret all that information. You need specialists on both ends, both to acquire the data and to interpret it, so it often becomes a tool that's used when there are already symptoms or when (heart) disease has sort of already progressed,\" said Deo, chief data scientist at One Brave Idea, an organization centered on finding new ways to fight heart disease. It is partially funded by the American Heart Association. </p>    <p>Conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure, risk factors for cardiovascular disease, often change the structure and function of the heart muscle years before the onset of any symptoms, he said. \"We wanted to figure out how to get studies done at an earlier level &#8230; picking up severe cases earlier on, even when people don't have any symptoms.\" </p>    <p>Looking at 14,035 echocardiograms, collected over 10 years from a University of California San Francisco database, researchers fed 23 views of each heart chamber from every test into a computer algorithm. They also provided labels for every specific, identifiable image captured.</p>    <p>The result was a set of programs that, ultimately, independently identified images, provided measurements and spotted potential problems. Deo said automating echocardiogram interpretation could help \"democratize\" the tests, allowing them to be conducted in more settings, such as primary care offices or rural areas that lack cardiologists and other medical specialists.</p>    <p>An estimated 7.7 million echocardiograms were performed in U.S. hospitals from 2001 to 2011, a period that saw the use of the tests grow at an average annual rate of 3.41 percent, according to one study.</p>    <p>The process of assessing echocardiograms is still a long way off before there's no longer a need for human expertise, said Dr. Mario Garcia, chief of cardiology at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. </p>    <p>\"To arrive at a diagnosis and decide upon a treatment, you need not only the interpretation of the images, but you need to know the patient's symptoms and incorporate that with other medical information that's available -- like what's the patient's blood pressure, and what have other tests that have been conducted show?\" said Garcia, who was not part of the study. </p>    <p>Garcia, who estimates his hospital conducts anywhere between 25,000 to 30,000 echocardiograms a year, said the accuracy of the automated measurements in the study demonstrate \"a real advancement\" in technology, but disease detection isn't foolproof.</p>    <p>\"You may have the diagnosis being made correctly 85 percent of the time, but what do you do in the other 15 percent if you are wrong?\" he said. \"A 15 percent error in medicine is not an acceptable rate.\"</p>    <p>Garcia compared it to the automation of the stock market over the past several decades. </p>    <p>\"The development of computers was important for getting data in the stock market,\" he said, \"but deciding whether to use that data to actually make an investment still requires a human being.\"</p>",

He is chief medical officer for the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center insurance services division.</p><p>The presence of competition tends to hold down price increases that occur during a shortage, the researchers also found.</p><p>Drugs made by three or fewer manufacturers can be expected to increase about 13 percent in price during a shortage, compared with just 8 percent price hikes during shortages affecting medicines supplied by more than three manufacturers, the study found.</p><p>\"This effect was stronger in drugs that were supplied by three or less manufacturers,\" said lead researcher Inmaculada Hernandez, an assistant professor of pharmacy and therapeutics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy.</p><p>For their study, the researchers drew data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's database on drug shortages.</p><p>The investigators identified 90 drugs that underwent an active shortage in 2016, and tracked pricing data for 11 months prior to and following each shortage, to see how prices were affected.</p><p>Prices of drugs increased by about 7 percent in the 11 months prior to a shortage, but about 16 percent in the 11 months after a shortage began, the findings showed.</p><p>Prices of drugs supplied by three or fewer manufacturers increased by 12 percent before and 27 percent following a shortage. For drugs supplied by more than three manufacturers, prices increased by 2.5 percent and 4.8 percent in the 11 months before and after the shortage began, respectively.</p><p>The findings were published online Sept. 17 in the <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p>Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) referred requests for comment to the Association for Accessible Medicines (AAM), a trade group for generic drug manufacturers.</p><p>The AAM said more recent events have overtaken this study, rendering its conclusions outdated.</p><p> \"For the past two years since this study's short and dated snapshot in time, the generic industry has averaged 7 percent deflation of its prices,\" said Allen Goldberg, the AAM's vice president of communications. \"We are working with government and industry to address the low reimbursement for generic drugs, which is the root cause of many shortages.\"</p><p>But the findings were \"not surprising\" to Claire McAndrew, director of campaigns and partnerships for Families USA, a health care consumer advocacy group.</p><p>\"The results of this study are quantifying drug company behaviors we have witnessed during public health crises and drug shortages before,\" McAndrew said. \"I think it's quite common that we see drug companies leveraging public health crises or drug shortages for huge profits.\"</p><p>As an example, McAndrew pointed to skyrocketing prices during the opioid epidemic for naloxone (Narcan), the lifesaving medicine that can reverse an opioid overdose.</p><p>\"The entire drug pricing system right now is set up to allow profiting off of health crises, but there are steps policymakers can take related to the pricing system and the patent system to improve the way the system works for health care consumers,\" McAndrew explained.</p><p>Lawmakers could make it easier for generic versions of drugs to hit the market, improving price competition, McAndrew said. They also could craft other policies that discourage price gouging during shortages.</p><p> Shrank suggested that one tactic might be to cap the amount of price increase that can occur in the setting of a shortage.</p><p>\"We could easily make an exception if there was some extenuating circumstance like a natural disaster,\" Shrank said. \"In the absence of that, it seems reasonable to create a cap on drug prices during a shortage.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Hospital Association has more about <a href=\"https://www.aha.org/2017-12-11-high-rising-drug-prices-myth-vs-fact\" target=\"_new\">rising drug prices</a>.</p>",

The disease claims nearly 450,000 lives around the world each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p><p> People diagnosed with the disease can be treated with drugs that destroy the replicating form of the parasite, but dormant sexual forms may remain, the researchers explained.</p><p>These dormant parasites can be transmitted to mosquitoes that bite infected people. Once transferred, these dormant parasites mature, multiply and gather in the mosquito's salivary glands where they are ready to infect others who are bitten by the insect.</p><p>But the researchers identified compounds that could stop the spread of malaria by making malaria parasites incapable of infecting mosquitoes.  After screening more than 70,000 compounds, the team pinpointed six with the potential to become malaria-blocking drugs.</p><p>Once in mosquitoes, sexual malaria parasites are very active, which makes them ideal drug targets. To identify compounds that could interfere with these sexual parasites, the researchers tricked the parasites into replicating. </p><p>\"Overall, we screened around 70,000 molecules and found only a handful of potent compounds that are both active and safe to use with human cells,\" Baum said. \"It was like finding needles in a haystack.\"</p><p>The scientists are researching all the compounds to determine exactly how they work and how they could be developed into drugs that are stable enough to be given to person and survive being ultimately transferred to mosquitoes.</p><p>The findings were published Sept. 18 in the journal <i>Nature Communications</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/malaria/index.html\" target=\"_new\"> malaria</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Sept. 17, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Is America's love affair with meat starting to lose its luster?</p><p>A new survey finds that many Americans are cutting back on the amount of red and processed meat they eat -- and even some poultry and fish --  because they're worried about their health or their finances. </p><p>Americans still eat more meat than health experts recommend. High meat consumption has negative consequences for people's health and the environment, according to scientists at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.</p><p>For the study, the research team surveyed 1,112 U.S. adults to investigate consumers' views on meat consumption and their eating habits over the past three years.</p><p>The investigators found that 66 percent of those polled were eating less of at least one type of meat.</p><p>\"Many Americans continue to have strong preferences for meat, but this survey adds to a growing body of evidence that a significant portion of the population may be purposefully reducing their meat consumption without becoming vegetarian or vegan,\" said study leader Roni Neff. She is an assistant professor in the Bloomberg School's department of environmental health and engineering.</p><p>\"We hope our findings will be useful for the development of awareness campaigns and other interventions geared towards helping consumers reduce their meat consumption in a way that is good for their health, their grocery budgets, and the environment,\" Neff added in a university news release.</p><p>Of those surveyed, 55 percent said they were reducing their consumption of processed meat and 41 percent were cutting back on red meat. Thirty-seven percent said they had increased the amount of poultry and seafood in their diet.</p> <p>Sixty-four percent said they curbed their meat intake by buying less meat, 56 percent by reducing portion sizes, 42 percent by having meatless meals, 32 percent by choosing to have meatless days and 9 percent by avoiding meat entirely. Most of those eating more meatless meals reported opting for vegetables instead. Other meat alternatives included cheese and additional dairy products and eggs. </p><p>Survey respondents aged 45 to 59 were twice as likely to cut their  intake of one or more types of meat as younger adults aged 18 to 29. And women were more likely to eat less meat than men, the findings showed. </p><p>In most cases, the respondents said they cut back on meat to save money or protect their health. Those with annual household annual incomes of less than $25,000 were more likely to cut back on meat, poultry or fish than those with incomes exceeding $75,000. The researchers noted that parents with children were less likely than adults without kids to eat less meat.</p><p>Fewer people made the decision to reduce meat at mealtime out of concern for the welfare of animals or the environment. Those who chose not to curb their intake felt that meat was essential for a healthy diet.</p><p>The survey findings could serve as the basis for new campaigns to raise awareness about nutrition, plant-based meals and the environmental effects of meat production, the researchers suggested.</p><p>The report was published recently in the journal <i>Public American Nutrition</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. National Institutes of Health has more about eating <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-red-meat\" target=\"_new\">red meat</a>.</p>",

But if the group doesn't practice giving, you probably won't either, researchers say. </p><p>This finding is based on a six-year study of the Hadza hunter-gatherer people in Tanzania. Their lives have remained mostly unchanged for hundreds of years. </p><p>\"The Hadza are one of the last populations left on the planet who live a similar lifestyle to how our ancestors lived for millions of years,\" said study author Ibrahim Mabulla, of the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. \"They offer insight into how cooperation evolved.\"</p><p>If the researchers' conclusions are right, it might explain why modern humans cooperate with others, including strangers -- giving blood, for example, or tipping, despite getting nothing in return. </p><p>According to the report, the Hadza are usually willing to share, but not always. They change communal groups every couple of months, and fellow campmates strongly influence their tendency to share.</p> <p>\"We found individual willingness to share changed from year to year to match their current campmates and found no evidence that people preferred living with more cooperative people,\" said the study's first author, Kristopher Smith, of the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Sharing, the researchers concluded, is driven by local group norms and behavior, not individual altruism.</p><p>For the study, the researchers visited 56 Hadza camps over six years. They asked nearly 400 adults to play a game. In the game, people were given four honey straws, which they could either share with the group or not. If they shared, the total contribution to the group was tripled.</p><p>In some camps, everyone shared, and in some camps people shared very little. The researchers had expected all the camps would contribute similar amounts, but people acted differently over time, changing their behavior to match the norms of their current neighbors.</p><p>The report was published Sept. 20 in the journal <i>Current Biology</i>. </p><p>\"We were surprised to find that people do not have a stable tendency to cooperate and are instead influenced by those around them,\" lead author Coren Apicella, of the University of Pennsylvania, said in a journal news release. \"Our results show that there is no such thing as good guys and bad guys.\"</p><p>The moral may well be that your behavior can affect the behavior of those around you -- if you're generous yourself, you can get others to be generous, too.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>For more on human origins, visit the <a href=\"http://humanorigins.si.edu/human-characteristics\" target=\"_new\"> Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History</a>.</p>",

The best thing you can do is donate blood year around,\" said first study author Dr. M. James Lozada. He's  an assistant professor of anesthesiology at  Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Tennessee.</p><p>Lozada, who started the study while at Northwestern's School of Medicine in Chicago, explained that a typical blood donation takes two days to process, but most blood transfusions for shooting victims occur within the first 24 hours of the tragedy.</p><p>The study examined the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, which occurred in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, 2017. There were 58 deaths, 869 wounded people, and 220 hospital admissions, including at least 68 critical care admissions.</p><p>A public call for blood donations was announced during a news conference and widely reported by the media. In the three days after the shooting, the American Red Cross saw a 53 percent spike in blood donations nationwide.</p><p>The Las Vegas blood bank, United Blood Services, reported 791 blood donations immediately after the mass shooting. Of those donations, 137 (17 percent) went unused and were later discarded, compared to an average of 26 wasted donations per month at the blood bank.</p><p>The findings, which were published online Oct. 29 in <i>The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery</i>, showed that a call for immediate blood donation was unnecessary in Las Vegas and probably in other mass shootings, the authors said.</p><p>\"From our data, it is likely that the total one-day blood component transfusions needed in Las Vegas were more than in any mass shooting on record,\" Lozada said in a Northwestern news release.</p><p>\"One of the things that we propose in the paper is for cities to develop some protocols for these scenarios, where instead of issuing a blanket call for blood donation you would do it in a systematic way. As one suggestion, you might do it by ZIP code,\" he said.</p><p>\"Our findings are important to help us prepare for the next mass shooting in the United States. It shows us the amount of blood components we likely will need. It will also help first responders adequately prepare to save lives,\" Lozada added.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Red Cross explains how <a href=\"https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/how-to-donate/how-blood-donations-help.html\" target=\"_new\">blood donations help</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 2, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The hour you \"lost\" with daylight savings time in the spring you \"gain back\" on Sunday, when clocks are set an hour back.</p><p>And every time shift takes a subtle toll on the human mind and body, experts say.</p><p>Still, \"for most people, it is easier to stay up an hour later than to go to bed an hour earlier,\" said Dr. Steven Feinsilver, who directs sleep medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"This is thought to be because for most of us our 'internal clock' is closer to a 25-hour cycle than a 24-hour cycle.\"</p><p>He said the furthest you can comfortably shift your internal clock is about an hour a day, and \"what sets [your] clock is the wake time more than the bedtime.\"</p><p>Feinsilver said that to get back to a normal sleep rhythm, \"set the alarm for your target time and get out of bed when it goes off, even if your night sleep was not perfect.</p><p>\"For the time change, set the alarm for Monday -- for most of us the Sunday morning wake-up is less critical -- and enjoy the extra hour,\" Feinsilver said.</p><p>A single night of imperfect sleep is easily gotten over -- \"it is when bad sleep becomes a habit we get into trouble,\" he said. Feinsilver's advice is to try to sleep a regular seven to eight hours -- and \"stick to a constant wake time.\"</p><p>Triggers such as light, food and exercise are the cues that tell your body what time it is.</p><p>\"Getting exposed to light early in the day wakes us up,\" Feinsilver said. \"This is harder in the winter when there is less and later light, but the autumn time shift helps a bit.\"</p><p>Dr. Daniel Barone is a neurologist and sleep medicine expert at the Center for Sleep Medicine at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City. He said that people shouldn't expect that the extra hour of sleep they'll get on Sunday will erase any accumulated \"sleep debt.\"</p><p>\"We as a society sleep one hour less than we did 100 years ago, so we are still 'behind the clock' so to speak when it comes to being sleep-deprived,\" Barone said.</p><p>He said the body's sleep clock can be directly affected as autumn days grow shorter and people spend more time indoors. The body manufactures vitamin D via sunlight's action on the skin, and too little vitamin D can affect sleep and emotions.</p><p>\"When you're not getting as much sunlight, it has an effect on your mood,\" Barone said. For some people, this can even mean the onset of a kind of depression known as seasonal affective disorder (SAD).</p><p>Barone offered these tips for better sleep:</p><ul><li>Switch to LED lightbulbs. They're made to simulate sunlight and can help you maintain a healthy circadian rhythm as seasons change.</li><li>Cut out the evening nap. Dozing off after dinner sends confusing signals to your brain that can make bedtime later more challenging.</li><li>Try mindful meditation. It can cut stress and encourage healthy sleep.</li><li>Ban TVs, smartphones and laptops from the bedroom. The backlight display can disrupt sleep if used before lights-out.</li><li>Keep bedrooms dark. Light creeping in can send a wake-up signal to the brain.</li></ul><p>If you're still having trouble sleeping, consult a sleep specialist for testing, Barone said.</p><p>\"If you're continually waking up in the night or you're constantly waking up tired, a sleep test is definitely warranted,\" he said.</p><p>\"We should view sleep as something that's sacred,\" Barone said. \"Our bodies are designed to get seven to nine hours. In this 24-hour society, a lot of times the amount of sleep we get suffers. We should focus on getting good-quality sleep and dealing with any problems that exist.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on getting good sleep at the <a href=\"https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-tools-tips/healthy-sleep-tips\" target=\"_new\">National Sleep Foundation</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Sept. 18, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- A new approach to preventing gout attacks looks promising for people not already helped by existing treatments.</p><p>Researchers are looking at an anti-inflammatory drug called canakinumab (Ilaris) to treat this painful form of arthritis. </p><p>Instead of targeting excessively high uric acid levels as existing gout drugs do, the new strategy aims to reduce overall inflammation. The drug goes after a specific inflammatory molecule called interleukin-1.</p><p>The result was a 50 percent drop in gout attack risk, the researchers found.</p><p>\"This was a very large effect,\" said study lead author Dr. Daniel Solomon, a rheumatologist with Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. </p><p>He acknowledged it was \"very surprising\" that the drug packed an equally protective punch whether patients had normal uric acid levels or very high levels.</p><p>But Ilaris is unlikely to be the preventive drug of choice any time soon, said Solomon.</p><p>For one, it has not yet received approval for gout treatment in the United States. And most patients already achieve risk reduction with standard uric acid-lowering treatments, such as allopurinol (brand names Zyloprim,  Aloprim).</p><p>What's more, decades-old allopurinol  is a cheap daily pill.</p><p>\"Canakinumab is very expensive,\" said Solomon. Its main role to date is as a last-ditch treatment for rare, so-called \"orphan\" diseases. At its current price, he said, \"it is not a viable option for most patients with gout.\"</p><p>Also, it must be injected every three months by a caregiver.</p><p>Still, Solomon said Ilaris may have a clinical role for patients who don't respond to or tolerate standard medications. </p><p>Prior research had shown that interleukin-1B inhibitors can shorten gout attacks, but it wasn't known if they could prevent them, the study authors said.</p>  <p>The new research was funded by Novartis, the maker of Ilaris. The results were published online Sept. 17 in <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p>Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. When a chemical called uric acid builds up in the body, it triggers the formation of tiny jagged crystals that cause severe joint paint, most often in the foot, particularly the big toe. Gout's prevalence has increased considerably in recent decades.</p><p>Heart disease and gout often overlap, the researchers noted. To explore whether Ilaris has potential as a preventive measure, investigators conducted a secondary analysis of the so-called Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study (CANTOS). This enlisted more than 10,000 heart attack patients to see if Ilaris might help reduce future cardiovascular complications among high-risk individuals.</p><p>The researchers found that patients treated with four injections of Ilaris a year faced half the risk for a gout attack, compared with those given a dummy (placebo) treatment, regardless of uric acid levels.</p><p>\"We have no strong reason to believe that [Ilaris] would be less effective in patients without known heart disease,\" said Solomon.</p><p>Howard Feinberg, a professor of rheumatology at Touro University in Vallejo, Calif., agreed. </p><p>Based on the current and prior research, \"we can assume that this drug will work for most patients,\" including those without a history of heart disease, he said.</p><p> Feinberg said he \"would not recommend its use for someone who did well on older medications\" because of its high cost and the need to give it as in injection. </p><p>\"The type of patient who would benefit the most is someone who was allergic or could not take standard therapy,\" Feinberg said, mentioning patients with kidney disease. \"This treatment is also ideal for someone whose gout could not be controlled on allopurinol or other older therapies.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about gout treatment at the <a href=\"https://www.arthritis.org/about-arthritis/types/gout/treatments/types.php/\" target=\"_new\">Arthritis Foundation</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, March 28, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Blood vessels created in the lab can successfully turn into \"living tissue\" in patients on dialysis for advanced kidney disease, a new study suggests.</p><p>The results come from just 13 patients in an early-phase trial. But researchers said they are a sign that the engineered tissue might eventually offer new treatment options for patients with damaged blood vessels -- due to conditions ranging from heart disease to traumatic injuries.</p><p>The study, published March 27 in <i>Science Translational Medicine</i>, involved kidney disease patients who were implanted with the lab-created blood vessels so they could receive dialysis.</p><p>Right now, the \"gold standard\" way to give patients dialysis is by creating a fistula, a kind of surgically-made passage, said Heather Prichard, senior researcher on the study.</p><p>To do that, a surgeon joins a vein and artery in the patient's arm or leg, which allows blood to travel through tubes into the dialysis machine, where toxins are removed.</p><p>But, Prichard said, some patients' veins are not strong enough.</p><p>In those cases, a synthetic implant may be used to join a vein and artery. But the implants can't mimic real vessels, and they carry a greater risk of blood clots and infections.</p><p>So Prichard and her colleagues at Humacyte, Inc. -- a Durham, N.C.-based biotech company -- took a different approach. They created blood vessels in the lab.</p><p>The researchers started with biodegradable, tube-like scaffolds, which they seeded with smooth muscle cells from deceased human donors. The scaffolds were then housed in a bioreactor system to develop for eight weeks. After that, researchers removed all cells from each structure, leaving behind a matrix that essentially provided the outer shell of a blood vessel.</p><p>The idea, Prichard explained, is that once the vessel is implanted, the patient's own cells will gradually populate it, making it similar to the body's native blood vessels.</p><p>Based on the new findings, the concept may work.</p><p>Researchers have been able to analyze tissue from the 13 patients who took part in the early study of the implants. They found that the patients' own cells and tiny blood vessels had migrated to the engineered vessels.</p><p>\"The patient's cells can repopulate it and make it living tissue,\" Prichard said.</p><p>Because the vessels do not contain foreign cells, she said, a patient's immune system shouldn't reject them. There were no signs of an immune response in the tissue from the 13 patients.</p><p>But much more research remains: The company is now running two later-stage trials, comparing the engineered vessels with standard approaches in kidney dialysis patients.</p><p>As it stands, there is no evidence the vessels work any better than the \"well-established materials in clinical use,\" said Dr. Frank LoGerfo, a professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School in Boston. He was not involved in the study.</p><p>It's also unclear whether the structures can form an \"endothelialized\" lining that helps them fully function like blood vessels, LoGerfo said. Nor is it clear how durable they will be under \"full arterial pressure\" from blood flow, he added.</p><p>The ultimate hope, according to Prichard, is to be able to create large numbers of engineered blood vessels that doctors can essentially obtain \"off-the-shelf\" for use in patients with various vascular illnesses, including heart disease.</p><p>That's different from the labor-intensive process of custom-engineering a blood vessel from a patient's own stem cells.</p><p>Another vascular surgeon who was not involved in the study called the progress being made toward bioengineered vessels \"exciting.\"</p><p>\"Having a vessel that handles and acts like real tissue is the 'holy grail,'\" said Dr. Stephen Hohmann, of Baylor Scott &amp; White Heart and Vascular Hospital in Dallas.</p><p>\"If you could have a tube, of any size, that acts like a blood vessel -- and have it available off-the-shelf -- that would open up a whole world,\" Hohmann said.</p><p>He stressed, though, that \"there is still a way to go before that happens.\"</p><p>The more immediate question, Hohmann said, is whether these engineered vessels can perform any better than existing approaches for dialysis patients.</p><p>In addition to the dialysis trials, Prichard said her company has begun two other studies.</p><p> One is focusing on patients with peripheral artery disease, a condition in which narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to the limbs. The other is on patients with traumatic blood vessel injuries that require surgery.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering has more on <a href=\"https://www.nibib.nih.gov/science-education/science-topics/tissue-engineering-and-regenerative-medicine\" target=\"_new\">bioengineered tissue</a>.</p>",

But they said the findings support the notion that the method of feeding matters, too.</p><p>Many women, particularly in the United States, have to pump breast milk when they return to work, noted lead researcher Meghan Azad, an assistant professor of pediatrics and child health at the University of Manitoba in Canada.</p><p>\"The message here is not that pumping is 'bad' or 'wrong,' \" she said. \"It's better than formula-feeding.\"</p><p>However, Azad explained, there are reasons why feeding at the breast might promote the healthiest rate of weight gain.</p><p>For one, she said, breast milk contains a range of \"interesting enzymes and hormones.\" And it's possible that their activity is depleted when pumped milk is refrigerated.</p><p>In addition, Azad said, it's thought that babies learn to \"self-regulate\" food intake when they nurse at mom's breast. In contrast, when parents bottle-feed, they often take charge -- encouraging their baby to finish the bottle.</p><p>Dr. Joan Meek is chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics section on breastfeeding. She said the AAP recommends exclusive breastfeeding for about six months. Once the baby starts on solid foods, Meek said, breastfeeding can continue \"for as long mother and child desire.\"</p><p>She agreed that there are reasons direct breastfeeding is ideal -- and the new findings support that. But practically speaking, Meek added, many women have to pump.</p><p>\"The lack of paid maternity leave policies in the U.S. can be a barrier for mothers who work outside the home,\" Meek said. \"Certainly for those mothers, their [pumped] breast milk is still the next best thing to direct breastfeeding.\"</p> <p>The findings, published online Sept. 24 in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i>, are based on more than 2,500 mother-infant pairs.</p><p>On average, the study found, babies who were still exclusively breastfed at 6 months had the healthiest weight by the age of 12 months. By comparison, babies who were no longer exclusively breastfed at 6 months had a threefold greater risk of being overweight by their first birthday.</p><p>However, when the researchers looked at moms' feeding methods, they found that babies given pumped breast milk tended to weigh a little more than those who fed from the breast.</p><p>It all suggests that direct breastfeeding is better for a \"healthy weight trajectory,\" said Dr. Alison Holmes, a pediatrician at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Hanover, N.H.</p><p>Like Meek, Holmes acknowledged the practical barriers. So she recommended that any time working moms are with their baby, they opt for the direct route rather than the bottle.</p><p>Holmes also pointed to a side benefit: \"There's less time spent washing dishes.\"</p><p>The study also looked at the effects of solid food introduction on babies' weight. In general, it found, when babies started on solids before the age of 5 months, their weight gain was on the rapid side.</p><p>But there was no sign that introducing solids at 5 months, rather than 6 months, spurred especially quick weight gain.</p><p>\"So introducing solids at that age may be OK, if that's what your baby wants,\" Azad said.</p><p>When it comes to starting solids, Holmes said, there seems to be a window that's best for babies' overall health.</p><p>\"Introducing solid foods sometime after the 5-month mark, but before the 7-month mark is healthiest in terms of balancing the benefits of healthy weight gain, allergy prevention and infectious disease prevention,\" she said.</p><p>To Azad, the findings have implications not just for parents, but for policies on paid maternity leave.</p><p>\"This is saying, you can't just give moms a breast pump and think you've solved the problem,\" Azad said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The AAP has more on <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/Breastfeeding/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_new\">breastfeeding</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY,  Sept. 20, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Puppies can be cute and cuddly, but they also carry germs that might make you very sick, a new government report warns. </p><p>An outbreak of antibiotic-resistant <i>Campylobacter</i> infections in 2017 and 2018 that sickened 118 people in 18 states was traced to pet store puppies, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>\"This is most likely the tip of the iceberg,\" said researcher Dr. Mark Laughlin, a CDC veterinarian science officer.</p><p>Among those sickened by the bacteria, 26 were hospitalized. Of those who became ill, 29 were pet store employees. It's likely that many others got sick, but not sick enough to go to the doctor, or doctors didn't report cases, Laughlin added.</p><p><i>Campylobacter</i> is not a rare bacteria. In fact, according to the CDC, it causes 1.3 million diarrheal illnesses in the United States each year. </p><p>\"People most often get <i>Campylobacter</i> after they consume undercooked chicken,\" Laughlin said. They can also get it from contaminated water and raw milk. </p><p>But it's rare that an outbreak of <i>Campylobacter</i> occurs,  \"and it's rare that it's associated with contact with pets,\" Laughlin said. </p><p>This outbreak was also unique because the bacteria was resistant to the antibiotics usually used to treat it, he explained.</p><p>According to Dr. Marc Siegel,  a professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, most people who are sickened with <i>Campylobacter</i> aren't treated with antibiotics.</p><p> The reason antibiotics aren't usually used is because they kill the bacteria but release the toxins the bacteria carries, and it's the toxins that cause most of the symptoms, Siegel said.</p><p>Usually, people get better without treatment, he noted.  \"One of the most common symptoms is bloody diarrhea,\" Siegel said.  Other symptoms include headache, muscle ache and fever. The illness usually lasts about a week and then goes away. </p><p> <i>Campylobacter</i>  is usually spread from feces, he said. It's common among chickens because of the way they're raised -- all crammed together. </p><p>It's possible that the same thing happens among puppies from puppy mills and pet stores, where the animals are in close contact with each other, Siegel suggested.</p><p>According to Laughlin, the outbreak was limited to dogs from pet stores. \"These dogs are raised in close quarters with lots of opportunity for them to mix and co-mingle,  so there's lots of opportunity for germs to spread among these dogs,\" he added.</p><p> Siegel said that because people get it from coming into contact with feces, or other places where the bacteria live, and then touching their mouth, transmitting the infection from one person to another does not usually occur. </p><p>He explained that  your dog can be infected with <i>Campylobacter</i> and not be sick, but it may still carry the germ. </p><p>Laughlin suggested that the best way to prevent getting sick after petting or playing with a dog is to wash your hands with soap and water. That's especially important after picking up dog poop, he added.</p><p>Because young children, older adults and people with weak immune systems can become seriously ill from <i>Campylobacter</i>, hand washing is particularly important, Laughlin stressed.</p><p>Siegel said that not every dog carries <i>Campylobacter</i>. \"But this is a reminder to people that your pet can have a bacteria that can get you sick,\" he added.</p> <p>The report was published Sept. 21 in the CDC's <i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on <i>Campylobacter</i>, visit the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/index.html\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

Because many smaller studies had not produced much evidence of any benefit in adding fish oil supplements to statin use, the hopes of heart experts were not high.</p><p>But the new trial, to be presented in November at the American Heart Association's annual meeting,  showed that these patients saw a 25 percent drop in their relative risk of heart attacks, strokes and other cardiac events compared to a control group of patients who received a placebo.</p><p>\"I'm very surprised by the magnitude of the results, which quite frankly are large. My expectations were very low. A lot of people are legitimately surprised by this,\" Dr. Michael Blaha, director of clinical research at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins Medical School, told the <i>Times</i>.</p><p>\"Fish oil has long been a popular supplement to protect against heart disease. It contains high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, primarily EPA and DHA, which reduce inflammation and lower triglyceride levels,\" explained Blaha, who was not involved in the trial. \"Omega-3 fatty acids also have blood-thinning effects similar to those of aspirin.\"</p><p>The new trial differed from previous studies in two aspects, the newspaper reported. First, it focused on a specific group of high-risk patients: People with a history of heart disease, diabetes or heart risk factors. In addition, all of the patients were on statins, which lower cholesterol.</p><p>Secondly, Vascepa was not the typical fish oil supplement that can be bought in any drugstore or supermarket. Manufactured by Amarin, Vascepa is a prescription drug that contains highly purified EPA, according to the <i>Times</i>.</p><p>Fish oil supplements often contain a mixture of both EPA and DHA and, in some cases, other oils. Both EPA and DHA can lower triglycerides, but DHA also tends to raise \"bad\"  LDL cholesterol, the newspaper said.</p><p>In the trial, more than 8,000 patients were followed for about five years, during which the drug was well tolerated and safe, the researchers noted.</p> <p>Dr. Ethan Weiss, a cardiologist and associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco, told the <i>Times</i> that the findings carried a few caveats. All of the data remains to be seen, and the group of patients most likely to see a benefit is very specific, added Weiss, who was not involved in the study.</p><p>Vascepa is now only approved for certain patients who have very high triglyceride levels, the newspaper said.</p><p>\"The worried well shouldn't run out and take fish oil,\" said Dr. Michael Shapiro, a site investigator for the trial and director of Oregon Health and Science University's Atherosclerosis Imaging Program.</p><p>But, \"the amount of people around the world who have atherosclerotic disease or diabetes who take a statin and still have elevated triglycerides is enormous,\" he said. \"This has huge implications.\"</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Critics Demand Stop to 'Guinea Pig' Sepsis Clinical Trial </b></span></p><p>A major nonprofit advocacy group is asking that a large government trial into the common and dangerous blood infection sepsis be shut down.</p><p>The trial, called Clovers, \"places seriously ill patients at risk without the possibility of gaining information that can provide benefits either to the subjects or to future patients,\" according to an analysis of the trial by investigators at the U.S. National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Md.</p><p>And in a letter sent to the federal Office for Human Research Protection, advocacy group Public Citizen compared the study to \"an experiment that would be conducted on laboratory animals,\" <i>The New York Times</i> reported.</p><p>\"The human subjects of the Clovers trial, as designed and currently conducted, are unwitting guinea pigs in a physiology experiment,\" Public Citizens' Dr. Michael Carome and Dr. Sidney Wolfe wrote in their letter.</p><p>The Clovers trial began in March and is funded by the NIH. It is moving forward and hopes to enroll 2,320 patients from 44 hospitals nationwide.</p><p>The scientists behind the study say it seeks to ascertain the best approach to treating sepsis, a major killer. According to the <i>Times</i>, at least 1 million Americans contract the condition annually, and 30 percent of them will die.</p><p>Sepsis occurs when the body's immune system mounts a massive attack against an infection, triggering inflammation throughout the body. Sepsis is typically first treated with antibiotics, but the condition can progress and cause lethal blood clots or organ failure.</p><p>The Clovers trial seeks to determine which one of two therapeutic options -- limiting fluids and using drugs that narrow blood vessels, or adding IV fluids and holding off on drug therapy  -- works best to curb sepsis. </p><p>But critics claim participants enrolled in Clovers could end up being given substandard care, endangering their lives.</p><p>For example, patients might see delays in the time it takes to receive fluids, and since sepsis progresses rapidly (often within 24 hours), such delays could prove fatal, Public Citizen says.</p><p>But the scientists behind Clover say those fears are unfounded, and that because sepsis care varies widely, in essence every Clover participant will still receive \"usual care.\"</p><p>Individual participants will also be allowed to deviate from study protocols if deemed necessary to preserve their health, added Dr. Nathan Shapiro, a professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School and co-chairman of the protocol committee for the study.</p><p>\"If the physician at the bedside thinks the patient needs a specific treatment, they will get it,\" Shapiro told the <i>Times</i>.</p><p>One expert not connected to the study believes more insight into proper sepsis care is needed.</p><p>\"There is not a lot of data about how much fluid to give, how much is enough, how much is too much, how much is too little,\" said Dr. Tiffany Osborn, an emergency physician and critical care specialist who spoke to the <i>Times</i>  on behalf of the College of Emergency Medical Physicians. \"That information is hard to get a handle on.\"</p><p>But Public Citizen's Carome believes that Clovers' methodology is simply too dangerous for participants.  Speaking to the <i>Times</i>, he said, \"We think Clovers can't be fixed.\"</p>",

We have H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A strains, and two influenza B strains have been detected.\"</p><p>Flu seasons aren't predictable, which is why you shouldn't skip your annual flu shot, added another infectious-disease expert, Dr. Lisa Maragakis. </p><p>The mild flu season in the Southern Hemisphere, which is just winding down, provides clues to what this year's flu season might look like, explained Maragakis, senior director of infection prevention at Johns Hopkins Health System in Baltimore. </p><p>\"It's cautiously good news that it might be a milder season than we saw last year -- so fingers crossed,\" said Maragakis. </p><p>Still, even when activity overall is low, people still get influenza, Brammer said. \"And influenza can have really tragic consequences. Even people that are healthy and young can get influenza and it can, in rare cases, lead to death,\" she added.</p><p>Last year, 80,000 people in the United States died from flu -- a record high, Brammer said. The deaths included 183 children, most of whom were unvaccinated.</p><p>Because last year's vaccine wasn't a good match to the predominant H3N2 virus, the vaccine has been tweaked, Brammer said. </p><p>This year's four-strain vaccine includes H1N1 and H3N2 plus the two influenza B strains. The three-strain vaccine has just one B strain, Brammer said. </p><b>Who is most at risk?</b><p>It's critical that mothers of children under 6 months get vaccinated, because their babies can't, Brammer said. </p><p>Others at highest risk for flu complications, particularly pneumonia, are young children, older people and those with chronic medical conditions, she said.</p><p>Getting vaccinated protects others. It's the best way to safeguard yourself, your loved ones and coworkers, Brammer said.</p><p>But myths still persist.</p><p>A recent survey by Orlando Health Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Florida found that a third of parents with children under 18 think the shot won't work. And more than half believe you can get the flu from the vaccine.</p><p>Both beliefs are wrong, Brammer said. Vaccination is the best protection regardless of age.</p><p>You can't get the flu from a flu shot because the viruses in the vaccine are dead, she said. They trigger your immune system to make antibodies against the flu, but can't give you influenza. </p><p>Although the nasal spray vaccine uses a live virus, it has been altered so you can't get flu from it, Brammer said. However, this vaccine is not for everyone, and you should check with your doctor first.</p><p>October is the best time to get vaccinated, because it takes 10 days to two weeks for the vaccine to become fully effective. You'll be protected by the time flu season is in full swing, Maragakis said.</p><p>What else can you do to boost protection?</p><p>Wash your hands often, cover your coughs and sneezes, and avoid getting close to someone who is ill, Maragakis said. </p><p>If the flu does strike, your doctor can prescribe antiviral drugs that will shorten the time you're sick, she said. These medicines work best if taken when symptoms start. </p><p>In addition, stay out of work, so you don't infect others, Brammer said. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on flu, visit the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/index.html\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

Twenty chose to have an ablation, a procedure that destroys the heart tissue causing the abnormal heartbeat; the other 58 were on medications to control their heart rate and prevent blood clots.</p> <p>When the study began, 35 percent of the participants reported experiencing severe anxiety and distress and 20 percent reported having had suicidal thoughts. One year later, the researchers found that the patients who had an ablation were less likely to report feelings of anxiety and depression than the patients taking medications. In addition, the number of patients in the ablation group with suicidal thoughts dropped from six to one.</p> <p>The study's senior author, Jonathan Kalman, an electrophysiologist at the Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia, said the study \"demonstrates that effective treatment of atrial fibrillation markedly reduces psychological distress.\"</p>    <p>In addition, Kalman said the findings \"implicate atrial fibrillation as the cause\" of the anxiety and depression. \"This psychological impact is not well appreciated by many heart specialists and is important to take into consideration when considering\" how patients are treated, he added.</p> <p>The study also found higher levels of anxiety and distress among patients found to have a Type D personality, which is characterized by anger and pessimism. Previous studies have linked this personality type to poor health outcomes and lower quality of life in patients treated for AFib.</p> <p>Of the 78 patients in the study, 35 were identified as having this type of personality on the distressed personality scale. The researchers suggest that identifying patients with this personality type could help health care providers focus attention on those most at risk for experiencing anxiety, distress or suicidal thoughts.</p> <p>At least 2.7 million Americans are living with AFib, an abnormal heartbeat that affects blood flow and can lead to stroke, heart failure and other heart complications.</p> <p>Dr. Dimpi Patel is an internist and researcher at Wilmington Health at New Hanover Regional Medical Center in North Carolina who studies the mind-heart link. \"Patients need to be aware that physical ailments can and do have psychological manifestations, and both must be acknowledged and managed to ensure a good quality of life and perhaps even prevent worse outcomes,\" she said.</p> <p>Patel, who was not involved in the study, said the study's small size limited what could be construed from the findings. She said that she would like to see studies that look at the impact of different types of psychological therapies on patients with AFib as well as studies that focus on how women with the condition are affected by psychological distress.</p> <p>Many physical health problems can affect someone's mental health. \"It is important to note that psychological distress, depression, anxiety and, at times, suicidal ideation are not exclusive to atrial fibrillation, but to many chronic diseases such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure,\" Patel said.</p> <p>\"Physicians have an obligation to broaden their approach in managing any chronic illness to include emphasis on the psychological well-being of their patient,\" she added. \"To me, it is simply practicing good and compassionate medicine.\"</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Sept. 18, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The very air you breathe may make you vulnerable to developing dementia, a new study suggests.</p><p>British researchers found that people exposed to higher levels of air pollution had 40 percent higher odds of developing dementia.</p><p>\"We found that older patients across greater London who were living in areas with higher air pollution were more likely to be diagnosed with dementia in subsequent years,\" said study author Iain Carey. He's a senior lecturer in epidemiology at the University of London.</p><p>Carey said the increased risk persisted even after his team accounted for other factors that might increase dementia, such as smoking and diabetes. </p><p>However, the researchers aren't suggesting that people need to abandon cities. </p><p>\"Since this is an observational study, any findings need to be treated with caution. It only tells us there may be a possible link between air pollution and dementia, and more research is needed to confirm and understand this,\" Carey said. </p><p>Dementia is a catch-all term for a number of brain disorders that cause trouble with memory and thinking. The most common form of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, according to the U.S.-based Alzheimer's Association.</p><p>The second most common form of dementia is called vascular dementia. This occurs when the brain is deprived of blood flow and oxygen due to other conditions, such as a stroke or a number of small strokes, the Alzheimer's Association explained.</p><p>The study focused on people who were eventually diagnosed with these two forms of dementia. </p><p>The researchers began by reviewing the records of nearly 131,000 adults registered with 75 general physician practices in the London area. Carey said all of the locations were in urban areas. </p><p>At the start of the study, all of the participants were between the ages of 50 and 79. None had been diagnosed with dementia.</p><p>The researchers then estimated each person's annual exposure to air pollution, such as nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter and ozone. They also estimated the participants' proximity to heavy traffic.</p><p>After an average follow-up of seven years, almost 2,200 people -- or nearly 2 percent of the total group -- had been diagnosed with dementia. </p><p>Those living in the areas with the highest levels of nitrogen dioxide compared to those living with the lowest exposure had a 40 percent increased risk of developing dementia, the study found. The odds of an Alzheimer's disease diagnosis was 50 percent higher for people living with the highest exposure to nitrogen dioxide. </p><p>Similar increases in risk were also seen for high levels of particulate matter. For other measures, such as ozone and distance to heavy traffic, the researchers said there was less evidence of any links.</p><p>Carey said it's not clear why air pollution appears to be linked to dementia. He noted that other research has suggested that children's brain development may be affected by pollution.</p><p>Heather Snyder, senior director of medical and scientific operations for the Alzheimer's Association, said this study \"raises a lot of interesting questions.\" But she also said it's too soon to speculate how pollution might play a role in dementia.</p><p>\"Dementia is complex and there are lots of things that may contribute to dementia risk. I don't think you can draw any conclusions from this study,\" Snyder said.</p><p>Dr. Bruce Silverman, a neurologist at Ascension Providence Hospital in Southfield, Mich., also thought it was too early to make any recommendations based on this study. He also noted that dementia occurs in people living all over -- in urban, suburban and rural areas. </p><p>But he said if you start looking at factors that might cause premature death of nerve cells in the brain, \"living in an environment that is toxic to those cells from pollution is probably not healthy.\" </p><p>Both Snyder and Silverman recommended that if people are concerned about dementia, there are steps they can take to help prevent the disorder, or to potentially help slow the progress of dementia if you already have it. </p><p>Steps that both experts recommended included getting regular exercise, eating a healthy diet low in saturated fat with plenty of vegetables and fruits, getting adequate sleep, and keeping your brain engaged with things like puzzles, new learning and social activities. </p><p>The study was published Sept. 18 in the <i>BMJ</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about keeping your brain healthy from the <a href=\"https://www.alz.org/help-support/brain_health/10_ways_to_love_your_brain\" target=\"_new\">Alzheimer's Association</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Sept. 25, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- More people are stepping in to help give CPR when someone's heart stops, and first responders are intervening at higher levels -- but survival rates are higher for men who have cardiac arrests than for women, a recent study suggests.</p> <p>Based on data for 8,100 people in 16 North Carolina counties from 2010 to 2014, researchers measured the impact of a state initiative to improve care for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients. The Duke University-led study was inspired by the Institute of Medicine's 2015 call for action for better care of patients whose hearts stop outside of a hospital.</p> <p>Despite \"tremendous improvement\" in CPR and first responder defibrillation, \"we did not see improvement in survival for women, which is disappointing,\" said Dr. Carolina Malta Hansen, a researcher at Duke Clinical Research Institute.</p> <p>\"This improvement only seems to be substantial for a small group of patients -- usually younger and male patients -- who have a cardiac arrest in a public place,\" said Hansen, who led the study, published in the <i>Journal of the American Heart Association</i>.</p> <p>Different than a heart attack, cardiac arrest is an often-fatal event caused by the sudden loss of heart function in someone who may or may not be diagnosed with heart disease. More than 350,000 cardiac arrests happen outside of U.S. hospitals each year, with about 90 percent of those people dying.</p> <p>CPR -- or cardiopulmonary resuscitation -- can double or triple a person's chance of survival. In 2014, about 45 percent of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims survived when bystander CPR was given.</p> <p>But only about 46 percent of those who suffered cardiac arrests outside of a hospital in 2017 received bystander CPR.</p> <p>Hansen said a number of factors might explain why women had worse outcomes. Compared to male victims of cardiac arrests, women are more likely to have cardiomyopathy, or disease of the heart muscle, and non-shockable rhythms that can't be treated with defibrillation. Women who suffer cardiac arrests also tend to be older than men and live at home alone, with less chance of CPR being performed.</p> <p>\"Those are all characteristics that we know are associated with poorer survival,\" she said.</p> <p>\"This study has complex findings that, in many ways, raises more questions than it answers,\" said Dr. Benjamin Abella, director of the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Resuscitation Science and a professor of emergency medicine. \"But the most important message is that CPR works: The more people who deliver CPR, the more survivors you have who can leave the hospital and return to their families. That's the good news.\"</p> <p>Abella, who was not involved in the study, said the results underscore the need for more research on ways to improve bystander CPR and increase the use of automated external defibrillators in public places. He said some bystanders might be hindered by the idea of removing clothing or touching the breasts of a woman to perform CPR or use an automated external defibrillator (AED).</p> <p>\"We need to have a better understanding of people's psychology when they're faced with emergency situations, so we can address it through education or training,\" he said. \"We need to go deeper and understand the barriers: Is it fear of being sued? Is there some other emotional barrier?\"</p> <p>Training might be improved by using female manikins with breasts, or by using virtual reality simulations, Abella said. \"The advantage of virtual reality is you can make it very lifelike and get a truer sense of somebody's response.\"</p> <p>Hansen said there's still a great need to strengthen \"all the links in the chain of survival,\" including training 911 dispatchers, emergency workers, the public and hospital staff.</p> <p>\"But the most important thing for the general public to know is that bystander intervention is paramount,\" she said. \"You shouldn't be afraid of doing something wrong, because anything is better than nothing: Stepping in and starting CPR and applying an AED before EMS arrives is the foundation for survival.\"</p>",

Inflammation can lead to fluid buildup behind the eardrum. The eustachian tubes, which connect the middle ear to the back of the nose and throat, could become swollen.</p><p>Babies and children are more prone to these problems than adults because their still-developing immune systems have a harder time fighting off infections.

Also, try to protect baby from getting frequent colds -- 46 percent of infants had the common cold before their ear infection diagnosis.</p><p>Middle ear infections are the leading cause of doctor visits and prescriptions for antibiotics.

The companies have 60 days to come up with plans to stop those sales or the FDA said it will consider a ban on the sale of all flavored e-cigarette products.</p><p>\"E-cigarettes have become an almost ubiquitous -- and dangerous -- trend among youth that we believe has reached epidemic proportions,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said Tuesday in a statement. \"This troubling reality is prompting us to take even more forceful actions to stem this dangerous trend.\"</p><p>The new program, called \"The Real Cost\" Youth E-Cigarette Prevention Campaign, is targeted at the nearly 11 million at-risk teens, aged 12 to 17.

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Sept. 27, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Having a limb amputated can be traumatic, yet experts say not enough is being done to prevent a common disease that can lead to limb loss.</p> <p>Critical limb ischemia, or CLI, is a severe form of peripheral artery disease, a narrowing of the arteries of the extremities that typically affects the legs. At least 6.8 million Americans ages 40 and older have peripheral artery disease. Among them, more than 1 percent develop critical limb ischemia.</p> <p>Critical limb ischemia is caused by the same artery-clogging plaque that causes heart attacks and strokes, said Dr. Mark Creager, director of the Heart and Vascular Center at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire.</p> <p>\"CLI occurs when the blockages are so severe that the blood supply to the leg -- and particularly to the foot -- is inadequate to maintain its normal nutritional needs. A patient's skin might break down and progress to ulcers and gangrene, and they may end up losing their leg,\" said Creager, a professor of medicine at Dartmouth.</p> <p>Estimates vary on how many people with CLI go on to have amputations, with one study reporting that without treatment, up to 40 percent of patients have an amputation within one year. Symptoms of CLI include leg and foot pain, infections, and cracks and sores that don't heal.</p> <p>\"Look at your feet. The presence of painful fissures, particularly between the toes, nonhealing ulcers, and blackened toes could each be an indication of CLI,\" Creager said.</p> <p>\"Another sign of CLI is persistent pain in the feet, oftentimes when the patient is lying in bed, which may improve with standing. We have more blood supply to the foot when we're standing because of the effects of gravity. If you have more pain in your feet when you put your legs up, that's a worrisome symptom,\" he said.</p> <p>Spotting symptoms early and getting to the doctor quickly is essential, said Dr. Marie Gerhard-Herman, a physician and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.</p> <p>\"Early recognition is huge, because if you can increase blood flow to their foot or leg before the muscle starts dying, then you can actually bring the foot or the leg back to life,\" said Gerhard-Herman, who chaired the group that wrote the 2016 peripheral artery disease guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology.</p> <p>Patients with peripheral artery disease should be treated with cholesterol-lowering statins and blood-thinning medications to reduce the risk of heart attack and prevent CLI, Creager said. Once CLI occurs, patients should be considered for a revascularization procedure that restores blood flow and may involve stents or bypass surgery, he said.</p> <p>Two main risk factors for critical limb ischemia are smoking and diabetes, said Gerhard-Herman.</p> <p>\"We know that people who stop smoking have less peripheral artery disease, which means less CLI,\" she said. And because people with diabetes are more prone to infections, \"if they don't have enough blood delivered to the limb, they cannot fight the infection, and they lose the limb,\" she added, making better diabetes control extremely important.</p> <p>Other lifestyle factors that can help control peripheral artery disease and possibly prevent critical limb ischemia include eating a healthy diet, maintaining normal blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and getting regular exercise.</p> <p>But experts say there are still a lot of unanswered questions about how to best prevent and control critical limb ischemia.</p> <p>\"There's a terrific need for research to develop additional therapies for CLI &hellip; there's a long way to go,\" Creager said. \"We also have to enlighten the public about CLI so patients can take steps to get PAD identified earlier, get the appropriate treatment, and prevent the risk of progression of CLI and loss of limb.\"</p> <p>Eileen Bogosian can vouch for how traumatic the loss of a limb can be. A retired X-ray technician, singer and teacher, Bogosian, 84, developed peripheral artery disease and then critical limb ischemia after she was first diagnosed with a benign bone tumor and bone fractures on her right femur.</p> <p>After going through a series of stent surgeries, Bogosian had her right leg amputated above the knee in June.</p> <p>She said getting early treatment allowed her to keep her leg for several years longer than she otherwise would have, and she urged people to seek medical attention quickly, and reject any advice from friends who say otherwise.</p> <p>\"If you are suddenly noticing any questionable symptoms, don't wait. Waiting is going to possibly add damage to what you already have,\" said Bogosian of Seekonk, Massachusetts. \"I tell people -- especially elderly people -- to be your own advocate and get to a doctor. You need to catch it early and nip it in the bud so you can keep living a happy, healthy life.\"</p>",

Participants were surveyed in their fourth and final year of medical school and again their second year of residency. </p><p>Most residents were satisfied with their decision to become a doctor and with their chosen specialty, the findings showed. </p><p>But 45 percent reported at least one warning sign of burnout. Experiencing severe anxiety and low levels of empathy during medical school was associated with this physical and emotional fatigue. These residents were also more than three times more likely to regret their decision to become a doctor, the study found. </p><p>The study was funded by the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. It was published Sept. 18 in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>.</p><p>Pathology and anesthesiology residents who felt burned out were most likely to say that if given the choice, they would \"definitely not\" or \"probably not\" become a physician again. </p><p>Gender and ethnicity also played a role in doctor burnout, the study authors noted.</p><p> Female residents were at greater risk for signs of burnout than males.  And Hispanic residents were also more likely to regret their specialty choice. The researchers said these doctors are often pressured to participate in institutional diversity initiatives that could make their schedules more demanding than those of nonminority residents.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has more on <a href=\"https://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/clinicians-providers/ahrq-works/burnout/index.html\" target=\"_new\"> physician burnout</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Sept. 18, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Preliminary research in mice suggests that the Zika virus might be turned from foe into friend -- enlisted to curb deadly glioblastoma brain tumors.</p><p>A glioblastoma is among the most lethal of brain cancers, killing more than 15,000 Americans each year. U.S. Senators John McCain and Ted Kennedy both succumbed to this cancer.</p><p>In the new therapy, an international group of researchers used a harmless form of the Zika virus to target and destroy glioblastoma cells in mouse brains, while leaving healthy brain cells untouched.</p><p>The mosquito-borne Zika virus made headlines over the past few years because of its connection to severe brain defects in babies born to women infected in pregnancy.</p><p>But the virus might offer a new avenue for brain cancer care, according to a team led by Pei-Yong Shi, a virologist at University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, and virologist Cheng-Feng Qin of the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing.</p><p>They explained that Zika's ability to infect brain cells -- and cause devastating brain changes in the fetus -- could be used to target glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) in the brain as well. These stem cells are thought to be the source of tumor recurrence.</p><p>\"If we could find a way to specifically target those GSCs that are the source of recurrence, then that might provide an option to prevent recurrence or even a cure,\" Qin said in a news release from the American Society of Microbiology (ASM).</p><p>In their research, the team members first confirmed that Zika could attack glioblastoma stem cells, both in lab culture and in a mouse model. In fact, the virus was much more \"efficient\" at targeting the tumor cells compared to healthy brain neurons, they said.</p><p>Shi and Qin's group has already developed a candidate Zika virus vaccine, made from an inactivated, harmless form of the virus. This tweaked virus has a deletion from its genetic blueprint that makes it incapable of efficiently replicating, the researchers explained.</p><p>The scientists first confirmed that the vaccine was safe in mice. Next, they mixed the vaccine with a sample of glioblastoma stem cells, and injected that combo in the brains of mice. Other mice received an injection of the stem cells alone, without the tweaked Zika virus.</p><p>The result: While glioblastomas arose quickly in the brains of mice that didn't receive the vaccine, they developed much more slowly for mice that got the Zika vaccine as well.</p><p>And while the average survival time for mice without the vaccine was an average of 30 days, survival for those that had gotten the Zika vaccine was extended to 50 days.</p><p>Of course, this research is in an extremely early stage. But the hope is that glioblastoma patients might one day be given the Zika vaccine simultaneously with their surgery to \"let the viruses hunt down the GSCs and eliminate them,\" Qin said.</p><p>Brain cancer specialists cautioned that the research is promising but preliminary.</p><p>\"Many new therapies for glioblastoma have looked promising 'in vivo' [that is, in animal studies], only to fail later on,\" said Dr. Michael Schulder, who helps direct neurosurgery at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y.</p> <p>Still, he thinks the approach is \"ingenious.\"</p><p>\"The authors of this study cleverly used the very aspect of the Zika virus that has made it worrisome as a public health threat -- the tendency of the virus to replicate and damage brain cells, specifically the cells that are involved in brain development -- as a way to attack glioblastoma,\" Schulder said.</p><p>Dr. John Boockvar, vice chair of neurosurgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, agreed.</p><p>\"Like the authors in this study, we are looking for ways to trigger a strong immune response in patients with glioblastoma, which induces inflammation and eventually glioblastoma cell death,\" he said. \"Using a harmless form of the Zika virus to preferentially infect glioblastoma cells in order to illicit an immune response is a smart strategy to fight this devastating disease.\"</p><p>According to Shi, the next step is to collaborate with doctors to develop trials evaluating the approaches' safety in patients.</p><p>The study authors also hope to genetically tweak the Zika virus even more to make it a more effective killer of glioblastoma cells.</p><p>\"As a virologist, I see that we should take advantage of the 'bad' side of viruses,\" Shi said in the release. \"They should have a role to play in cancer treatment.\"</p><p>The findings were published Sept. 18 in the ASM journal <i>mBIO</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on glioblastomas, visit the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/brain-spinal-cord-tumors-adults/about/types-of-brain-tumors.html\" target=\"_new\"> American Cancer Society</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Dec. 3, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- If you're shopping for toys this holiday season, make sure some simple, old-fashioned items are on your list, pediatricians say.</p><p>In a new report, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is making recommendations on the best toys to buy for babies and young children. The bottom line: The traditional beats the digital.</p><p>\"This report is addressing the substantial change there's been in toys over the past couple of decades -- and the substantial change in parents' perception of toys,\" said Dr. Alan Mendelsohn, one of the report authors.</p><p>That is, traditional playthings like dolls, cars, blocks and crayons have given way to the virtual -- from games played on mobile devices to talking animals that read stories out loud.</p><p>Often, digital-based toys are marketed as \"educational,\" and many parents view them that way, said Mendelsohn, an associate professor of pediatrics and population health at NYU Langone Health, in New York City.</p><p>However, he said, while a digital toy might help kids learn a \"limited\" skill, it's really unconditional playtime that children need.</p><p>\"Toys are simply props that can be used to help parents and children spend quality time together,\" Mendelsohn said. It's that human interaction, he stressed, that matters.</p><p>Simpler toys can give children more freedom to use their imagination and creativity, practice problem-solving, and learn how to interact with others -- by having to negotiate game \"rules,\" for example, according to the AAP.</p><p>Story time is also a big part of that, Mendelsohn noted. \"Young children learn the most through interaction with their caregivers, and that includes reading out loud together,\" he said.</p><p>In other words, don't let an electronic bear take over the storytelling duties.</p><p>\"This is not to say that screen time, in moderation, is harmful,\" Mendelsohn said. \"But those toys should not replace interactions with your children.\"</p><p>He noted that for babies, there's no need for screen time, with the exception of video \"chats\" with family. The AAP advises against any screen media for children younger than 18 months, and suggests only very limited use between 18 and 24 months -- always with a caregiver playing along.</p><p>For children aged 2 to 5, the AAP recommends that parents limit all screen time -- including TV, computers and mobile devices -- to no more than one hour per day.</p><p>At this point, the iPad has only been around for about a decade, noted Dr. Dimitri Christakis, director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children's Research Institute.</p><p>That means it's not yet clear what kinds of effects -- good and bad -- electronic devices and apps might have on young kids' development, he said.</p><p>But, Christakis said, researchers do know plenty about the importance of human interaction in young children's play.</p><p>\"The problem with these devices,\" he said, \"is that they're designed to command the user's attention. They're hard to share.\"</p><p>And it's not just \"screens\" that can be problematic, Christakis added,  but also any \"electronic gizmo, with lots of bells and whistles.\"</p><p>When it comes to fueling kids' imaginations and helping them build an array of essential skills, \"simple is best,\" he said.</p><p>Christakis pointed to a study he conducted among lower-income families with toddlers. Some of the families were randomly assigned to receive toy building blocks, along with suggestions on activities parents and kids could do with the blocks. The other families did not receive the blocks until after the study was over.</p><p>In the end, toddlers given the toy blocks at the outset showed greater gains in their language skills.</p><p>Why would building blocks affect language development? \"It wasn't the blocks,\" Christakis said. \"It was the interaction between parents and children.\"</p><p>So, the AAP suggests, when you head out holiday shopping, think traditional: books; art supplies; dolls and stuffed animals; old-fashioned card games, board games and puzzles; toy cars, planes and trains; balls and tricycles.</p><p>When children use toy characters and objects to pretend-play, Mendelsohn said, they learn how to socialize, regulate emotions and build other skills they need in real life.</p><p>He and Christakis made another point: Parents need to put down their own devices, too.</p><p>If your baby sees that phone constantly in your hand, Christakis said, she'll eventually want it.</p> <p>Plus, Mendelsohn noted, whatever time you spend mesmerized by your device is time you're not spending with your children.</p><p>The report was published online Dec. 3 in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For tips on children's playtime, visit <a href=\"https://www.zerotothree.org/early-learning/play\" target=\"_new\">ZeroToThree.org</a>.</p>",

He is a professor and researcher at the university. </p><p>Doctors could then suggest lifestyle interventions, including weight loss, lower alcohol consumption and exercise, for those at genetic risk for high blood pressure, he added.</p><p>High blood pressure, which is a risk factor for stroke and heart disease, claimed almost 8 million lives around the world in 2015 alone, the researchers noted.</p><p>For the study, they examined the DNA of more than 1 million people and cross-referenced their genetic information with their blood pressure. </p><p>After comparing the people at highest risk for high blood pressure with those at lowest risk, the team calculated that all the genetic variants linked with the condition were associated with blood pressure that's roughly 13 mm Hg higher.</p><p>Among the newly identified blood pressure genes were variants already tied to other conditions, including the APOE gene linked to heart disease and Alzheimer's disease. The researchers noted some genes also played a role within the adrenal glands, and in body fat.</p><p>Study co-leader Paul Elliott, from Imperial College London, said, \"Identifying these kinds of genetic signals will increasingly help us to split patients into groups based on their risk of disease.\"</p><p>The findings also pointed to some possible new treatment approaches for high blood pressure. One of the newly found gene regions linked to high blood pressure is already targeted by the type 2 diabetes drug canagliflozin (Invokana, Sulisent).

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Sept. 25, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- If you're suffering from acute appendicitis, you might be successfully treated with antibiotics and never need an operation to remove your appendix, Finnish researchers report.</p><p>Most appendicitis cases are uncomplicated, which simply means the organ hasn't ruptured, so they can be treated with antibiotics. Only when the appendix looks like it may burst immediately is an operation necessary. And the difference is easily seen on a CT scan, said lead researcher Dr. Paulina Salminen, a surgeon at Turku University Hospital.</p><p>\"There are no severe complications associated with the antibiotic therapy, so it's a safe option,\" she said.</p><p>About 20 to 30 percent of patients with appendicitis have a perforated appendix that needs to be removed, but 70 to 80 percent of patients may only need antibiotics, Salminen added.</p><p>A perforation is a small tear in the appendix, which lets its contents leak out into the stomach. This can cause a potentially fatal blood infection.</p><p>In a trial that compared 273 patients who had an appendectomy with 257 treated with antibiotics, researchers found that about 60 percent of those treated with antibiotics didn't need to have their appendix removed in the five years after treatment.</p><p>In all, 100 of 257 patients treated with antibiotics had to have an appendectomy over the five years of the study, including 15 patients operated on during the initial hospitalization, the researchers found.</p><p>The report was published Sept. 25 in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>. </p><p>One U.S. expert brought up the pros and cons of antibiotics instead of surgery. </p><p>\"I think the big issue is this -- can physicians and patients accept the fact that there could be close to a 40 percent chance of recurrence in five years?\" said Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>This might not be acceptable for many people, he said.</p><p>\"It's a question of how risk-averse you truly want to be, given that once your appendix is removed with uncomplicated appendicitis, your risk of complications is quite minimal,\" Glatter said.</p><p>Patients need to understand that while antibiotics may effectively treat acute appendicitis 60 to 70 percent of the time, the treatment may also fail and require an operation, he said.</p><p>Although the antibiotics-only approach has been gaining increased attention and popularity, it requires further study in specific subgroups of patients who may be at higher risk, including patients with appendicolith, in which the appendix is obstructed with calcified deposits. These patients were excluded from this latest study, Glatter noted.</p><p>In addition, the study only looked at open appendectomy, not the less invasive laparoscopic appendectomy. The laparoscopic approach is associated with a shorter hospital stay and a lower risk of complications than open surgery, Glatter explained.</p><p>Antibiotic therapy required three days of intravenous antibiotics given in the hospital, plus seven days of oral antibiotics. The hospital stay after laparoscopic surgery was only one day, he noted.</p><p>\"The decision to initiate antibiotics-only as opposed to pursuing an operative approach to treating acute appendicitis should incorporate shared decision-making between physicians, patients and their families,\" Glatter said.</p><p>In fact, a recent survey from the University of North Dakota School of Medicine found that even though appendicitis often resolves with the use of antibiotics, the overwhelming majority of Americans would choose surgery instead. Only about 1 in every 10 adults said they'd use antibiotics to ease an inflamed appendix, according to survey results. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/appendicitis\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</a> for more on appendicitis.</p>",

It's the date that mandatory nutrition and calorie information took effect for most chain restaurants, enabling consumers to compare menu items before ordering and, hopefully, make smarter choices.</p><p>Some cities across the country had already required restaurants to post calorie counts so that diners know how many they're actually eating. But it turns out that many people ignore this valuable information.</p><p>One study done at fast food restaurants in New York found no change in the average number of calories people ordered in the six years following the start of menu labeling there. And the number of diners aware of the high calorie count of most fast foods actually dropped from 51 to 37 percent over the same period. Surprisingly, the researchers also found few differences between the number of calories in meals eaten at restaurants where labeling was mandatory and at other food establishments where it was not.</p><p>On the other hand, a separate study done in Phoenix found that even though the number of people who use labeling information was small -- just 16 percent -- it did result in their making choices that saved them nearly 150 calories.</p><p>Why should <i>you</i> pay attention to this information? About one-third of adult Americans are obese, a number that's expected to rise to 42 percent by 2030. So, many of us need to eat fewer calories. We also need to eat less saturated fat, a primary source of calories (think: cheesy dishes).</p><p>On a more positive note, some restaurant chains that made the decision to voluntarily label foods early on also lowered the calorie count on many offerings by nearly 140. So, labeling may be a catalyst for restaurants to offer low-calorie choices in addition to their regular selections, making it easier for you to eat healthful meals.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Find out more about nutrition labeling in restaurants at the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm515020.htm\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> website.</p>",

He is clinical chair of medicine at the University of Aberdeen School of Medicine in Scotland.</p><p>Although the Mediterranean diet is considered healthy, this study could not prove that the diet itself caused stroke risk to drop. </p><p>In addition, why men's risk for stroke isn't also lowered isn't yet clear, Myint said.</p><p>But, \"it is widely acknowledged that men and women are very different with regard to normal physiology,\" he added.</p><p>Women have unique stroke risk factors that include using oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy. And during pregnancy, having preeclampsia and gestational diabetes are considered risk factors for stroke, Myint pointed out.</p><p>\"It may be that certain components in the Mediterranean diet may influence risk of stroke in women more than in men,\" he said.</p><p>For the study, the investigators collected data on more than 23,000 men and women, aged 40 to 77, who took part in a large cancer study. The participants were followed for 17 years.</p><p> The researchers found that, overall, those who followed a Mediterranean diet cut their risk for stroke 17 percent. When looking at men and women separately, however, women saw a reduction in risk of 22 percent, while men saw a 6 percent drop in risk. The risk reduction among men, however, might be so small that it is a \"chance\" finding, the scientists added. </p><p>Moreover, among those with a high risk for stroke, the risk was lowered 13 percent for those who followed a Mediterranean diet, the findings showed. This association, however, was mainly due to a 20 percent reduction in risk among women, the researchers found.</p><p>The findings were published online Sept. 20 in the journal <i>Stroke</i>.</p><p>According to Samantha Heller, a senior clinical nutritionist at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, \"The Mediterranean eating style, which has great variations among several different cultures, is characterized by foods high in anti-inflammatory compounds, including fiber, vitamins, minerals and healthy plant compounds.\" </p><p>Previous research has suggested that the Mediterranean diet reduces the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, obesity and declines in thinking skills, she said.</p><p>Foods such as olive oil, zucchini, lemons, hummus, tabouleh, pasta, eggplant, lentils, tomatoes, artichokes, salads and spices are staples in many parts of the Mediterranean, Heller explained.</p><p>\"In contrast, the typical Western diet is high in foods that increase inflammation, such as burgers, hot dogs, steak, butter, sodium, sugary beverages, fried foods, fast and junk foods, all of which have been associated with increased risks of chronic diseases,\" she said.</p><p>Heller suggests skipping the ham and cheese on white bread with mayo for lunch, and instead trying hummus on whole wheat pita with cucumbers and tomatoes. For dinner, try going meatless a few nights a week with a pasta primavera, roasted vegetables, Greek salad, quinoa and lentil-stuffed lettuce wraps, she added.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart  Association  has more about the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/mediterranean-diet\" target=\"_new\"> Mediterranean diet</a>.</p>",

That risk starts to drop off by the time people reach young adulthood and middle age. But when people reach their 70s, their risk goes up again, with 1 in every 10 seniors affected.</p> <p>\"Eczema -- also known as atopic dermatitis -- is an itchy inflammatory skin disease,\" explained study author Dr. Katrina Abuabara, an assistant professor in the department of dermatology at the University of California, San Francisco.</p><p>\"Because eczema often develops early in life and waxes and wanes over time, most research has focused on children,\" Abuabara said.</p><p>\"Ours is the first large study to examine rates of active physician-diagnosed disease across the entire life span,\" she said. \"Similar to other reports, we found declining rates of active disease across childhood. We were surprised, however, to find steady rates of active disease throughout adulthood and increasing rates in older age.\"</p><p>To explore how eczema risk plays out over one's lifetime, Abuabara and the research team analyzed statistics regarding eczema cases on British residents between 1994 and 2013.</p><p>In all, the data concerned more than 8.6 million patients, ranging from infancy up to age 99.</p><p>Ultimately, the team found that individuals appear to face a 1 in 10 chance for developing eczema at some point in their lives.</p><p>But risk did vary across age groups. In fact, Abuabara noted, the risk follows a \"U\" shape: \"It is highest in childhood, dips among young adults, and rises in mid-to-late adulthood,\" she said.</p><p>Specifically, the researchers found that a near 20 percent risk among very young children starts to decline steadily during the preteen years, ultimately hitting a low of about 5 percent by the time people reach age  20.</p><p>Thereafter risk hovers steadily at that level, only to start a slow ascent again when individuals hit their late 50s.</p><p>The findings were published in the Dec. 3 issue of the <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p>As for treatment, Abuabara said the gold standard involves moisturizers, topical corticosteroids, phototherapy and immunotherapy drugs, as needed.</p><p>She also noted that \"the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved two new medications for eczema in 2016 and 2017, and more than a dozen additional agents are under development and clinical testing, offering hope for more personalized and targeted treatments.\"</p><p>Dr. Robert Kirsner, chairman of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine's department of dermatology and cutaneous surgery, characterized current treatment options as \"limited.\" He was not involved with the study.</p><p>\"Cost is an issue, and potential side effects of oral medications may also be an issue,\" Kirsner said. And only one injectable drug has been approved by the FDA, so insurance companies do not always agree to pay for medications, he said.</p><p>However, he noted that \"new medications are being developed, which will likely add tools to help alleviate patient suffering.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the study \"confirms other recent data suggesting that common eczema persists into adulthood,\" Kirsner said.</p><p>\"The fact that eczema is less common in young adults and middle-aged [people] suggests that either childhood eczema wanes over time and recurs, or that it wanes and new cases develop in late adulthood,\" he said.</p><p>Regardless, Kirsner noted that \"for a long time it was the thought that the majority of childhood cases of eczema resolve, but this is clearly not the case.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S.-based nonprofit National Eczema Association has more on  <a href=\"https://nationaleczema.org/eczema\" target=\"_new\">eczema</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Sept. 27, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Viruses and blood flow issues can, in rare cases, trigger sudden and profound hearing loss. Now, South Korean research supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen treatments to restore hearing in these patients.</p><p>A review of the collected evidence suggests that -- added to standard drug therapy -- hyperbaric oxygen treatment \"is the most beneficial treatment option\" for what doctors call \"sudden sensorineural hearing loss,\" according to a team led by Dr. Tae-Min Rhee. He's a specialist in hyperbaric medicine at the National Maritime Medical Center in Seoul.</p><p>One expert in the United States explained that this type of sudden hearing loss is rare but very troubling to patients.</p><p>\"Sensorineural hearing loss occurs in about 1 out of 10,000 people,\" said Dr. Darius Kohan, and is thought to be triggered by a viral infection or circulatory problems within the ear. Kohan directs otology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>He said that 1 in every 3 people will get their hearing back without any treatment. For the other two-thirds of patients, drugs -- most often steroids -- are used, as well as hyperbaric oxygen.</p><p>In this treatment, patients are placed in a device that boosts oxygen levels in the inner ear.</p> <p>But just how well does the therapy work? To find out, Rhee's group looked at data from 19 studies that compared outcomes for people with sensorineural hearing loss. Patients either received drug therapy alone or drug therapy plus hyperbaric oxygen. A total of more than 2,400 patients, averaging 45 years of age, were included.</p>  <p>The team found that people who got the combo therapy were 61 percent more likely to achieve complete hearing recovery compared to people who only got medicines. The average amount of hearing recovery was also higher, overall, for people who got both therapies rather than drugs alone.</p><p>Also, hyperbaric oxygen appeared most helpful for those patients who had experienced the most profound hearing loss.</p><p>Therefore, adding hyperbaric oxygen therapy to steroids or other drug treatment seems to be a \"reasonable option\" for people with this form of sudden hearing loss, Rhee's team said.</p><p>Kohan did have a few caveats, however. First, he said the analysis couldn't control for certain variables -- the dosage and timing of drug treatment, for example, or the presence (or not) of vertigo or tinnitus (ringing in the ears), which often accompanies sudden hearing loss.</p><p>He believes that \"far more studies, with much more stringent criteria and controlled variables are required to make more definitive conclusions.\"</p><p>Finally, there's the cost of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The study found that benefits usually appeared after at least 20 hours of therapy, and Kohan noted that hyperbaric oxygen typically costs $300 per hour in the United States.</p><p>The findings were published Sept. 27 in <i>JAMA Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders has more about <a href=\"https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/sudden-deafness\" target=\"_new\">sudden hearing loss</a>.</p>",

He's a doctoral student at Griffith University in South East Queensland.</p><p>\"Our research found that girls generally exhibit better reading and writing ability than boys as early as the fourth grade,\" he added.</p><p>For the study, the researchers examined a nationally representative sample of standardized test scores compiled over 27 years. The 3.4 million U.S. students tested included fourth, eighth and 12th graders.</p><p>The tests showed that by the fourth grade, girls scored much higher than boys in reading and writing. This disparity increased over the next eight years. By 12th grade, however, the gender gap in writing was more significant than it was for reading.</p><p>\"It appears that the gender gap for writing tasks has been greatly underestimated, and that despite our best efforts with changes in teaching methods does not appear to be reducing over time,\" Reilly said in a news release from the American Psychological Association.</p><p>Statistically, boys are at higher risk for learning disabilities than girls. In addition, boys may be less likely than girls to prioritize reading because of peer pressure to obey \"masculine norms,\" the study authors suggested.</p><p>Behavioral problems may also play a role. The researchers said there are gender differences in issues such as  physical aggression, defiance and attention disorders. Such conditions have been linked with reading and writing problems. \"These can be disruptive in the classroom, but might also point to a neurological contribution,\" Reilly said. </p><p>The researchers added that previous studies have also shown that girls use both hemispheres of the brain while reading and writing. Boys, on the other hand, are more likely to rely on only one side of their brain.</p><p>\"Bilateral language function presumably affords some benefits, which could explain the female advantage observed on such tasks,\" Reilly said.</p><p>The authors caution that reading and writing are the foundation for academic success later on. \"While we've concentrated on basic literacy, the demands on students for writing grow stronger as they progress through education. In particular, it's crucial for high school and college entry,\" Reilly said. \"Each year, more women than men apply for college entry, and more women than men complete their college degrees. It has a cascading effect on students, either up or down.\"</p><p>However, the study isn't  endorsing single-sex education, he said. \"Rather, it suggests that we need to better tailor our education to meet the needs of boys and really encourage in them early a love not just of reading but also writing,\" Reilly said.</p><p>The study was published Sept. 20 in <i>American Psychologist</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics has more about <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/school/Pages/Help-Your-Child-Enjoy-Reading-Aloud-Tips-for-Parents.aspx\" target=\"_new\"> encouraging kids to read</a>.</p>",

Among this year's most dangerous playthings are data-collecting dolls and fidget spinners full of lead, a new report says.</p><p>\"We should be able to trust that the toys we buy are safe. However, until that's the case, toy buyers need to watch out for common hazards when shopping for children's presents,\" said Dev Gowda, of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) Education Fund. </p><p>\"No child should ever be injured, get sick, or die from playing with a dangerous toy,\" Gowda said in a news release from the group.</p><p>The organization's annual \"Trouble in Toyland\" report highlights a number of dangers, including data-collecting toys that may violate children's privacy. </p><p>One example is a doll called My Friend Cayla that was found for sale at Walmart and Kohl's.</p><p>The doll has been banned in Germany for privacy violations. It is also the subject of a complaint by several consumer groups to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission because it may violate the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.</p><p>In July, the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a warning to consumers to \"consider cybersecurity prior to introducing smart, interactive, internet-connected toys into their homes,\" according to the \"Trouble in Toyland\" report.</p><p>Two fidget spinners sold at Target and distributed by Bulls i Toy, L.L.C., were found to have dangerously high levels of lead. The Wild Premium Spinner Brass had 33,000 parts per million of lead, which is more than 300 times the legal limit for lead in children' s products. The Fidget Wild Premium Spinner Metal had 1,300 ppm of lead.</p><p>Target has said it will remove the fidget spinners from store shelves.</p><p>\"Even small amounts of lead in toys can be ingested when transferred from fingers to mouth or from fingers to food,\" said Dr. Helen Binns, a lead expert and professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.</p><p>\"Lead harms the developing brain and is easily ingested through normal hand-to-mouth behaviors. Beware of these two fidget spinners, as they have dangerous amounts of lead,\" Binns said.</p><p>Despite a ban on small parts in toys for children under age 3, the report highlighted several toys that contain small parts, but have no warning label. These included a peg game, golf, and football travel games sold at Dollar Tree.</p><p>Balloons can get stuck in children's throats. They cause more choking deaths among children than any other toy or children's product.</p><p>The researchers found five balloon sets on store shelves that were either marketed to children under 8 or have misleading warning labels that make it appear they are safe for children between ages 3 and 8. They were at Dollar Tree (H2O Blasters - Water Balloons and Disney Princess Punch Ball Balloons); Party City (Mega Value Pack 12 Water Bomb Packs and Mega Value Pack 14 Latex Punch Balloons); and Dollar City Plus (Party Balloons - 10).</p><p>Numerous hoverboards continue to be recalled by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) for faulty battery packs.</p><p>Many hoverboards have been taken off store shelves over the past year, but they still pose a threat to children. Earlier this year, two young girls and a firefighter died in a house fire believed to be caused by a hoverboard that was charging and overheated. Last month, another house fire was attributed to a hoverboard.</p><p>\"Our leaders and consumer watchdogs need to do more to protect our youngest consumers from the hazards of unsafe toys,\" Gowda said.</p><p>If you're a parent or guardian, some steps you can take to protect children from unsafe toys include subscribing to email recall updates from the CPSC and other U.S. government safety agencies. You can also use the toy safety tips on U.S. PIRG Education Fund's website, and report unsafe toys or toy-related injuries to the CPSC.</p><p>You should regularly check that toys for older children are not left within reach of younger children who still put things in their mouths. Also, eliminate small magnet hazards from your home.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has more on <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/safety-education/safety-guides/toys\" target=\"_new\">toy safety</a>.</p>",

First, warm muscles with 5 minutes of light movement, then do a series of stretches to target all muscle groups. Always hold each stretch for 20 seconds. Yoga and tai chi are specific activities that increase flexibility and may even help ease the emotional stress of RA. To learn the basics, take a class or work one-on-one with an instructor, at least at first.</p><p>You can get the benefits of cardio with low-impact exercises, which are easier on your joints than a pounding activity like running. Walking is great, but swimming and water workouts put even less stress on joints because of the buoyancy of the water.</p><p>Support your joints by strengthening the muscles around them with resistance exercises. You can use stretchy resistance bands if weights are too hard to manage.

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Oct. 2, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Only a small percentage of Americans have had their DNA analyzed -- but many are tempted to try it, according to new research. </p><p>For the study, University of Michigan researchers surveyed nearly 1,000 adults aged 50 to 64. While curious about their ancestry or health risks, the majority said they fear they'll worry excessively if they learn they have genetic links to progressive diseases like macular degeneration, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.</p><p>\"Compared to previous findings in the general adult population, this age group appears to be a little more lukewarm about their views of the benefits versus the risks of genetic testing overall,\" Scott Roberts, a professor at the U-M School of Public Health, said in a university news release. </p><p>Overall, 14 percent of those polled had undergone either a direct-to-consumer genetic test or a test ordered by a doctor. Broken down further, more than one in 10 had ordered a genetic test themselves. One in 20 had taken a doctor-ordered DNA test, the findings showed. </p><p>The University of Michigan's National Poll on Healthy Aging also found that more than half of those polled were interested in DNA testing to help guide their medical care, shed light on their risk for disease and learn about their ancestry.</p><p>And 70 percent said they might want to learn their risk for Alzheimer's disease. On the positive side, genetics testing might help people decide if they should take steps to protect their health by enrolling in clinical drug trials for Alzheimer's, the researchers said.</p><p>Alison Bryant is senior vice president of research for AARP. \"We're living in an era when advances like DNA testing are providing an amazing amount of useful health information,\" she said.</p><p>\"As genetic testing becomes even more sophisticated and common among older adults, the challenge will be to ensure that people understand the benefits and limitations of these tests,\" Bryant said.</p><p>Around nine in 10 adults believe genetic testing can shed light on their own health risks, and those of their children and grandchildren, the poll found. But roughly 40 percent feel a genetic test is unnecessary if a family's medical history and risk factors are already known.</p><p>And two-thirds thought genetic testing would cause excessive worry about their long-term health. The researchers added that people who simply want to learn where they come from could be unexpectedly alarmed about their genetic risk for a debilitating disease. </p><p>It's important to remember that genetic test results are not 100 percent accurate, the researchers cautioned. Also, if you take a doctor-ordered DNA test, you can meet with a genetic counselor to help interpret the results.

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Oct. 29, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Parents of teens can add \"sextortion\" to the list of things to worry about, because a new study shows that 5 percent of teenagers are targets of this cybercrime.</p><p>Another 3 percent of teens have likely done it to others, the study authors added.</p><p>Sextortion is threatening to share sexually explicit photos without consent if a person doesn't agree to certain demands, such as sexual favors or money. </p><p>Probably the most well-known case of sextortion was Canadian teenager Amanda Todd. She was only 12 years old when someone she met online talked her into lifting up her shirt in front of a web cam.</p><p>It turned out that that person wasn't another teen. He was a grown man, and he threatened to share the images of her breasts at her school if she didn't put on another sexual show for him. She refused and he followed through on his threat.</p><p>In fact, he followed her online and shared the images again when she changed schools. He tortured her so relentlessly, and recruited others to do so as well, that she ended up taking her own life just before her 16th birthday.</p><p>\"Some kids make mistakes, and today the consequences can be pretty major and can follow them and affect them deeply psychologically and socially,\" said study author Sameer Hinduja.</p><p>\"Teens in first love believe they'll be together forever, and don't want to do anything to ruin the relationship,\" he explained.</p><p>Hinduja is a professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University in Jupiter.</p><p>Hinduja said he hasn't seen a specific sextortion law, but that charges for these behaviors can be filed under existing laws, such as laws on blackmail and extortion.</p><p>Dr. Richard Catanzaro, chairman of psychiatry at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y.,  said, \"Sextortion is just the latest form of online predation. All predators work by preying on people who feel isolated and, because they think there is no recourse, are forced to submit.\"</p><p>The study included a nationally representative sample of more than 5,500 middle and high school students aged 12 to 17. </p><p>Males were much more likely to have participated in sextortion than females -- either as a victim or the perpetrator.</p><p>Teens who identified as non-heterosexual were more than twice as likely to be the victim of sextortion. This finding is similar to other research that shows gay and transgender children are more likely to be involved in online abuse.</p><p>Fifteen appears to be the most common age to be involved in sextortion, the new study found.</p><p>One finding parents may find particularly alarming is that teens being victimized by sextortion attempts usually know the person trying to take advantage of them. They may have been a romantic partner or a friend. It's  unusual for someone to be targeted by a stranger, the researchers said.</p><p>Hinduja advises teens to \"be more vigilant with your relationships. You don't need to be obsessed with keeping a relationship at all costs.\" </p><p>Psychologist Judy Malinowski, from Ascension Health in Novi, Mich., pointed out that the \"human brain isn't fully matured until the mid- to late-20s.\" She explained that activities such as sex and aggression actually give kids a chemical surge in the brain (similar to one that people using drugs or gambling feel) that makes them feel good. </p><p>\"The power of that feeling is overriding common sense. They're getting such an emotional surge that whatever conscious thought they might have about what could happen is being shut off,\" Malinowski said.</p><p>Both Malinowski and Catanzaro said that if a teen is being victimized, he or she needs to talk to a parent or other trusted adult.</p><p> \"Find someone you can trust. Reach out to that one person -- coach, counselor, aunt, teacher, whoever -- and tell them this is happening and you don't know what to do about it,\" Malinowski said.</p><p>Catanzaro added, \"Find one rational adult in which to confide and get support from peers by speaking to friends. And, when something like this happens, think about the worst-case scenario. All people have a way of catastrophizing. If you think of the worst possible outcome, you will probably realize it's not as bad as more sexual exploitation.\" </p><p>The findings were published online recently in the journal <i>Sexual Abuse</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics has advice on talking to your kids about <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/news-features-and-safety-tips/Pages/Talking-to-Kids-and-Teens-About-Social-Media-and-Sexting.aspx\" target=\"_new\">sexting</a>.</p>",

Maryland Student Dies of Adenovirus-Related Illness</b></span></p><p>An 18-year-old University of Maryland student has died from an adenovirus-related illness, and there have been reports of five other cases among students.</p><p>Adenoviruses are common causes of colds, but some strains can cause more serious illnesses. Recently, at least 11 children at a New Jersey rehab facility died of adenovirus-related illness, <i>CBS News</i> reported.</p><p>The University of Maryland student who died was identified as Olivia Paregol, who was in her first semester of college. The university's health center said it learned of her illness on Nov. 1.</p><p>In a letter, the university said that \"the testing of one specimen sent to the CDC revealed Adenovirus 7, a strain that may cause more severe illness,\" <i>CBS News</i> reported.</p><p>The letter said departments campus-wide began increased cleaning of surfaces early in November in response to the situation, and warned students to be vigilant, particularly those with asthma, diabetes and those who have illnesses or take medications that weaken the immune system.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Cigarette Boxes to Carry 'Corrective Statements' Outlining Health Risks</b></span></p><p>Federal court-ordered \"corrective statements\" that outline the health dangers of smoking will soon appear on cigarette boxes sold in the United States.</p><p>In 2006, federal Judge Gladys Kessler ordered tobacco companies to issue \"corrective statements\" on their packaging, on company websites, and in print and television ads. The order was the result of a 1999 lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice against the tobacco industry.</p><p>As part of that court order, tobacco companies last year launched and paid for \"corrective statement\" ads on television and in newspapers. The requirement for statements on cigarette boxes takes effect Wednesday, <i>CNN</i> reported.</p><p>The statements explain that smoking is highly addictive, that it's difficult to quit, that nicotine changes the brain, and that all cigarettes can cause cancer, lung disease and heart attacks, and other health problems.</p><p>\"We are at a point where 480,000 people a year die from tobacco use,\" Mary Rouvelas, senior counsel for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, told <i>CNN</i>.</p><p>The network was one of the groups involved in the lawsuit against the tobacco industry.</p><p>\"We want to make sure that the public knows about the harms of smoking. We want to make sure that it knows about the fact that the industry intentionally manipulated nicotine, there are dangers of secondhand smoke. All those things that are in those statements are things that we think are very important to be out in the public domain,\" Rouvelas said.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>FDA Warns Two Companies About Bogus Opioid Addiction Treatments</b></span></p><p>Warning letters about products illegally marketed as treatments for opioid addiction, pain and anxiety have been sent to two companies, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday.</p><p>The agency has received reports of serious health problems associated with use of the products, which are marketed as dietary supplements and contain an unsafe food additive called tianeptine.</p><p>The warning letters were sent to Jack B Goods Outlet Store for its Tianaa Red, Tianaa White and Tianaa Green products and to MA Labs for its Vicaine product.</p><p>Tianeptine is approved to treat depression in other countries, but the FDA has not approved tianeptine for any use. Tianeptine can pose a number of health risks, including neurologic, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal problems, and can mimic opioid toxicity and withdrawal, according to the FDA.</p><p>In August, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said tianeptine exposure calls to U.S. poison control centers rose from 2014 to 2017, suggesting a possible emerging public health risk, the FDA said.</p><p>FDA-approved medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction can reduce by half a patient's risk of death from all causes, but the use of unproven treatments can increase their risk of death.</p><p>\"In this case, these companies are preying on vulnerable patients who may be seeking alternative treatments to serious medical conditions like opioid use disorder. They're also selling products with known safety issues,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in an agency news release.</p>",

Unhealthy exposure to these bioaerosols is very possible after a flood from a hurricane and especially during cleanup efforts 24 to 48 hours after the storm,\" she said in a university news release.</p> <p>Exposure to mold primarily affects the lungs and the skin, Schenck said. How you react to mold depends on the severity of your exposure. Some people may be more susceptible to mold-related illnesses than others, including children and those with a weakened immune system, asthma or another chronic illness.</p><p>Warning signs of mold-related health issues include:</p><ul><li>Nasal congestion and sneezing. </li><li>Hoarse voice and throat irritation.</li><li>Cough, wheezing, shortness of breath or chest tightness.</li><li>Flareup of asthma symptoms.</li><li>Respiratory symptoms. </li><li>Extreme tiredness.</li></ul><p>These symptoms may not develop right away, Schenck noted. She advised doctors to be extra vigilant about educating their patients about mold risk following a storm or natural disaster.</p><p>During a post-storm cleanup, the UConn experts advised the following:</p><ul><li>Assume any areas exposed to water or flooding for more than 24 hours have mold  even if it's not apparent. </li><li>While cleaning mold, use an \"N95\" respirator that has bands to hold the mask close to the face. Dust and surgical masks will not protect against mold and mold spores. People at high risk for mold-related illnesses should not attempt to personally clean up following a flood. If water damage covers more than 100-square-feet, seek professional help with the cleanup. </li><li>Wear protective clothing. Cover the skin on the arms, hands, legs and feet while cleaning mold. Use long rubber gloves that extend to the middle of the forearm. </li><li>Wear unvented goggles during mold cleanup to protect the eyes. </li><li>Clean hard surfaces with soapy water.  Avoid using bleach or other \"fungicides\" unless there is contamination from other flooded materials such as sewage. These harsh chemicals aren't more effective than soapy water and could cause or worsen lung irritation. </li>    <li>Don't attempt to clean soft materials and porous surfaces like fabrics and wall board.  Throw away these items. </li></ul> <p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency offers more on <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/natural-disasters/hurricanes#recover\" target=\"_new\"> hurricane safety and preparedness</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 10, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- With sales of electronic cigarettes skyrocketing, Americans remain divided on whether the devices are a boon or a threat to public health.</p><p>That's the main finding of a new <i>HealthDay/Harris Poll</i> that surveyed over 2,000 adults on their e-cigarette views.</p><p>Vaping has long been promoted as a way to help smokers kick the habit -- offering them a route to get nicotine without the carcinogens in tobacco smoke.</p><p>But e-cigarettes aren't harmless, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health authorities. There's particular concern about young people vaping -- in part, because nicotine can harm brain development, which continues until about age 25.</p><p>In the poll, most adults did have misgivings about e-cigarettes: 85 percent said they were worried that the long-term health effects of the devices are unknown; and 83 percent were at least \"somewhat\" concerned about teenagers using e-cigarettes.</p><p>In fact, 43 percent of adults felt that e-cigarettes are actually more dangerous than traditional cigarettes.</p><p>On the flip side, about as many people (41 percent) viewed e-cigarettes as \"healthier\" than traditional cigarettes. And 42 percent rated them as an \"excellent way\" to quit.</p><p>It all adds up to differing views, and possibly confusion, about e-cigarettes and their health effects.</p><p>There are, in fact, many unknowns.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, at this time we have no scientific evidence on the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes, especially given the unknown effects of the aerosols and flavorings in e-cigarette liquids,\" said Dr. Thanh-Huyen Vu, a research assistant professor at Northwestern University in Chicago.</p><p>However, researchers know plenty about nicotine.</p><p>The drug \"is well known to be addictive and toxic, and to have adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and on health in general,\" Vu said.</p><p>And that's enough to raise concerns about teenagers' e-cigarette use,  she added.</p><p>In addition, Vu said, studies have found that teenagers and young adults who use e-cigarettes are more likely than non-users to take up smoking.</p><p>And what about adults who use e-cigarettes in place of traditional ones?</p><p>The devices do allow people to avoid the chemicals they would inhale from burning tobacco, Vu noted.</p><p>\"It's been speculated that using them may be associated with better health outcomes, compared to traditional cigarette smoking,\" she said.</p><p>But again, Vu pointed out, there's the nicotine and its own health effects.</p><p>E-cigarettes come in different forms, with some emulating traditional cigarettes or pipes. One highly popular brand, called Juul, is shaped like a USB flash drive, and reportedly accounts for one-third of e-cigarette sales in the United States.</p><p>Last week, the CDC reported that Juul sales shot up 641 percent between 2016 and 2017. Researchers called the trend worrying because the devices have a particularly high nicotine content and are popular with young people.</p><p>\"No teenager should be vaping,\" said Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association -- referring to a common term for e-cigarette use.</p><p>However, Conley disputed the notion that e-cigarettes are driving kids to smoke. As researchers from the University of Buffalo recently argued, teen smoking has continued to decline at the same time e-cigarette use has risen.</p><p>Conley questioned the poll finding that 43 percent of people think e-cigarettes are more dangerous than traditional cigarettes. He said past surveys have found less fear around the devices.</p><p>But if people do think vaping is worse than smoking, Conley blamed misleading messages from certain researchers and media stories.</p><p>\"As long as vaping is helping smokers quit, it will bring public health benefits,\" he said.</p><p>Conley pointed to research evidence of that: Last year, a study at Georgetown University estimated that up to 6.6 million smokers would live \"substantially longer\" if they replaced their traditional cigarettes with e-cigarettes.</p><p>And a 2016 report from the Royal College of Physicians concluded that e-cigarettes -- when used by smokers aiming to quit -- are \"likely\" to benefit public health.</p><p>Still, Vu said that based on studies so far, it's unclear how effective the devices really are in helping smokers ultimately quit. \"E-cigarette use is still new, so it will take time to prove,\" she added.</p><p>This HealthDay/Harris Poll was conducted online within the United States between Sept. 25-27 2018, among 2,008 U.S. adults (aged 18 and over). This online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore no estimate of theoretical sampling error can be calculated.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The CDC has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">electronic cigarettes</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Oct. 15, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- In the flooding and devastation left by Hurricane Michael, Americans faced with the clean-up are facing a new health threat: mold.</p><p>Mold-related illnesses are a serious concern following severe flooding in the path of the storm, say experts from the University of Connecticut School of Medicine. </p><p>\"Where there's dampness and water, there's mold,\" said Paula Schenck, of the division of occupational and environmental medicine.</p><p>\"Mold is an indicator of a whole soup of biological material. Unhealthy exposure to these bioaerosols is very possible after a flood from a hurricane and especially during cleanup efforts 24 to 48 hours after the storm,\" she said in a university news release.</p> <p>Exposure to mold primarily affects the lungs and the skin, Schenck said. How you react to mold depends on the severity of your exposure. Some people may be more susceptible to mold-related illnesses than others, including children and those with a weakened immune system, asthma or another chronic illness.</p><p>Warning signs of mold-related health issues include:</p><ul><li>Nasal congestion and sneezing. </li><li>Hoarse voice and throat irritation.</li><li>Cough, wheezing, shortness of breath or chest tightness.</li><li>Flare-up of asthma symptoms.</li><li>Respiratory symptoms. </li><li>Extreme tiredness.</li></ul><p>These symptoms may not develop right away, Schenck noted. She advised doctors to be extra vigilant about educating their patients about mold risk following a storm or natural disaster.</p><p>During a post-storm cleanup, the UConn experts advised the following:</p><ul><li>Assume any areas exposed to water or flooding for more than 24 hours have mold -- even if it's not apparent. </li><li>While cleaning mold, use an \"N95\" respirator that has bands to hold the mask close to the face. Dust and surgical masks will not protect against mold and mold spores. People at high risk for mold-related illnesses should not attempt to personally clean up following a flood. If water damage covers more than 100-square-feet, seek professional help with the cleanup. </li><li>Wear protective clothing. Cover the skin on the arms, hands, legs and feet while cleaning mold. Use long rubber gloves that extend to the middle of the forearm. </li><li>Wear unvented goggles during mold cleanup to protect the eyes. </li><li>Clean hard surfaces with soapy water.  Avoid using bleach or other \"fungicides\" unless there is contamination from other flooded materials, such as sewage. These harsh chemicals aren't more effective than soapy water and could cause or worsen lung irritation. </li>    <li>Don't attempt to clean soft materials and porous surfaces like fabrics and wall board.  Throw away these items. </li></ul> <p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency offers more on <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/natural-disasters/hurricanes#recover\" target=\"_new\"> hurricane safety and preparedness</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Sept. 19, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- If a pregnant woman eats a lot of high-gluten foods, the odds that her child will have type 1 diabetes rise significantly, new research suggests.</p><p>In the study, pregnant women who had the highest consumption of gluten had double the risk of having a child with type 1 diabetes compared to those who ate the least gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye and barley. </p><p>However, the study authors noted that it's too soon to recommend that pregnant women change their diets based on the results of this one study.</p><p>\"The study brings new ideas to how type 1 diabetes develops. We did not know that the pregnancy period is important for the development of the disease [or] that the development of the disease is starting that early in life,\" said study co-author Dr. Knud Josefsen.</p><p> \"And it also holds the potential to reduce the frequency of the disease by simply changing the diet during pregnancy,\" added Josefsen, a senior researcher at the Bartholin Institute in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p><p>However, \"the study is observational and the link that we describe is an association,\" and not a cause-and-effect relationship, Josefsen said. The research also needs to be repeated in other populations. </p><p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that causes the body's immune system to mistakenly attack the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, according to JDRF (formerly Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation). Insulin is a hormone that helps usher the sugar from foods into the body's cells to be used as fuel. </p><p>The attack on the immune system cells leaves someone with type 1 diabetes with little to no insulin. Without insulin injections -- via multiple shots a day or an insulin pump -- someone with type 1 diabetes doesn't have enough insulin to survive. </p><p>Gluten is found in many foods -- including bread, pasta, cereal, crackers and cookies -- according to the Celiac Disease Foundation. Gluten triggers the immune system disorder called celiac disease that causes damage to the small intestine when gluten is consumed.</p><p>There's already a known link between celiac disease and type 1 diabetes -- approximately 10 percent of people with type 1 diabetes also have celiac disease, Josefsen said.</p><p>The latest study included data from almost 64,000 pregnant women enrolled from 1996 through 2002. Nearly 250 of these women's children developed type 1 diabetes. </p><p>The women answered questions about the foods they ate when they were 25 weeks' pregnant. </p><p>The average gluten intake was 13 grams per day. The range was less than 7 grams per day to more than 20 grams per day. Josefsen said a slice of bread has about 3 grams of gluten. A large serving of pasta -- about two-thirds of a cup -- has 5 to 10 grams of gluten, he said.</p><p>The researchers found that a child's risk of type 1 diabetes increased proportionally with every 10 grams of the mother's daily gluten intake. </p><p>Josefsen said there are some theories as to how gluten might contribute to the rise of type 1 diabetes. One is that gluten may cause inflammation and an immune response. </p><p>Maija Miettinen, co-author of an editorial that accompanied the study, said most of the theories as to how these two conditions might be related come from animal models. Like Josefsen, she said more research is needed.</p><p>\"This is the first study to suggest an association between high gluten intake during pregnancy and the risk of type 1 diabetes in the offspring. Therefore, it is too early to change dietary recommendations concerning gluten intake,\" she said. Miettinen is a researcher with the National Institute for Health and Welfare in Helsinki, Finland.</p><p>Miettinen also pointed out that women who have high-gluten diets in pregnancy may also continue to serve their children high-gluten fare. \"We do not know whether the possible risk associated with high gluten intake comes through prenatal exposure, childhood diet or both,\" she said. </p><p>The study was published online Sept. 19 in the <i>BMJ</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p> Harvard T.H.

He is director of spinal deformity surgery at the Spine Hospital at New York-Presbyterian in New York City.</p><p>For more complicated spinal problems such as scoliosis, stenosis, fractures or injuries, medical intervention is usually necessary, Lenke said. </p><p>\"But each person with or without spinal problems can benefit from adopting healthier lifestyle habits to keep your spine as strong as possible,\" he said.</p><p>Lenke offered this advice: </p><ul><li>Maintain a healthy weight, don't smoke, do stretching and strengthening exercises that increase back and abdomen flexibility, and get regular cardiovascular exercise. If your job involves a lot of sitting, get up and walk around every 15 to 30 minutes.</li><li>Maintain good posture even while sitting. Don't slouch or hold your head too far forward. Be sure your feet are supported, hips are level with or slightly above the knees and your spine is slightly reclined. There should be a small arch in the lower back.</li><li>When sitting at a computer, your shoulders should be relaxed and away from the ears. Your elbows should be at the sides, bent to about 90 degrees, and your wrists should be neutral -- not bent up, down or away from each other. Your head should face ahead without being too far forward.</li><li>When using a mobile device for non-voice activities, hold it up instead of bending your neck to look down. At just 45 degrees, the work your neck muscles are doing is equal to lifting a 50-pound bag of potatoes.</li><li>When lifting, make sure objects are properly balanced and packed correctly so weight won't shift.

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Sept. 20, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Life expectancy in the United States has declined for two years in a row, fueled by increasing death rates from opioid drug overdoses, suicides and chronic liver disease, a new government report shows.</p><p>\"It's really the first time we've seen this multi-year drop\" in decades, said Renee Gindi, chief of the Analytic Studies Branch of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), part of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She's one of the lead coordinators for the report.</p><p>Babies now can expect to live 78.6 years on average, based on 2016 data that's the most recent, according to NCHS researchers.</p><p>That's down from 78.7 years in 2015 and 78.9 years in 2014.</p><p>\"We've been talking about the fact that our children will live less long than we will, and that's clearly coming to pass,\" said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.</p><p>Worse, it looks like the trend will continue for at least another year, said Benjamin, who wasn't involved with the research.</p><p>Preliminary CDC data released in May showed continuing increases in the leading causes of death in 2017, he noted.</p><p>\"I always tell people one year is interesting, two years is more interesting, and three years is a trend,\" Benjamin said.</p><p>Final longevity numbers for 2014 through 2016 were published Sept. 20 in <i>Health, United States, 2017</i>, an annual report produced by the NCHS.</p><p>Life expectancy at birth decreased by 0.2 years between 2014 and 2015, which was the first drop seen since 1993. It then decreased another 0.1 years between 2015 and 2016.</p><p>The opioid epidemic likely plays a large role in the continuing decline, the researchers said.</p><p>The age-adjusted death rate for drug overdose in the United States increased 72 percent between 2006 and 2016, and now stands at 19.8 deaths per 100,000 people.</p><p>There's also been a startling increase in the suicide rate. Between 2006 and 2016, the age-adjusted suicide death rate increased 23 percent, from 11 to 13.5 deaths per 100,000 people.</p><p>Suicides have been increasing in particular among military veterans and children, Benjamin said.</p><p>\"We don't understand all of the root causes of that, but we certainly are in a much more stressful society,\" Benjamin said. \"We have a huge population of people coming back from military service and [they] aren't necessarily getting the services they need to deal with mental health issues and traumatic brain injury.\"</p><p>Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis also appears to be driving the decline in life expectancy.</p><p>Death rates for chronic liver disease increased by an average 7.9 percent per year between 2006 and 2016 among men aged 25 to 34, the report found. Among women in the same age group, this increase averaged 11.4 percent per year.</p><p>This could have been caused by a number of factors, including alcohol use or hepatitis infection, Gindi said.</p><p>The report also noted increases in the rates of death caused by Alzheimer's disease and septicemia, or blood poisoning.</p><p>For decades, life expectancy increased based on public health measures people now take for granted, Gindi said -- modern sewers, clean water, vaccines.</p><p>More recently, a focus on caring for chronic diseases kept life expectancy growing.</p><p>\"When we acknowledged that chronic diseases played a larger role, we were able to start preventing and diagnosing and treating these in ways we hadn't been able to before, particularly heart disease and cancer,\" Gindi said.</p><p>But gains in life expectancy due to advances against heart disease and cancer have been flattening, Benjamin said, while these other causes of death have been increasing.</p><p>\"People were predicting this would be because of the obesity epidemic,\" Benjamin said of the downward trend in life expectancy. \"Not to say that doesn't play a role, but suicides and drug overdoses have eclipsed that in many ways and it's really a driving factor.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/life-expectancy.htm\" target=\"_new\">life expectancy</a> in the United States.</p>",

And with 25 percent of all man-made greenhouse gas emissions tracing back to food production, he said insect harvesting produces just a \"fraction\" of the greenhouse gases emitted in producing meat products.</p><p>Berger is an associate professor in the department of organization and human resource management at the University of Bern in Switzerland.</p><p>In the end, however \"delicious\" trumped \"healthy\" in gaining new fans of mealworms and crickets, Berger said.</p><p>\"The majority of humans eat insects, or come from a culture in which insect-eating is normal,\" he observed. But Berger acknowledged that in the Western world, the practice is \"predominantly associated with the emotion [of] disgust.\"</p><p>Given that, \"it is to be expected that utilitarian [nutrition] ads don't work well in the case of eating insects.\"</p><p>In the study, volunteers were described as \"well-educated\" and ranged in age from 18 to 72.</p><p>In a lab setting, all were told the study concerned \"new products,\" rather than insect food. After completing a food questionnaire, all reviewed an information sheet containing one of two ad options for a start-up insect food company. The first promoted insects as \"exquisite\" or good for the body or environment. The second ad promoted insect food as \"delicious,\" \"exotic\" or \"trendy.\"</p><p>The participants were then asked if they would try a mealworm chocolate truffle recipe.</p><p>After critiquing a food presentation, those who chose to eat the truffle indicated what they thought of it.</p><p>About 76 percent of those who saw an ad that emphasized the pleasure, tastiness, quality or luxury of eating an insect decided to try the truffle. That compared with just 61 percent of those shown an ad promoting nutritional and environmental benefits; 57 percent of those shown a nutrition-focused ad; and 66 percent presented with an environmental benefits ad.</p><p>Similarly, those who saw so-called pleasure-based ads were more inclined to actually like the mealworm truffle than those who saw ads focused on health and/or the environment.</p><p>The findings were published in the September issue of the journal <i>Frontiers in Nutrition</i>.</p><p>The notion that \"people eat for taste first\" makes sense to Connie Diekman, director of university nutrition at Washington University in St. Louis.</p><p>\"I've seen this as a registered dietitian,\" she said. \"If a food doesn't taste good, no matter how healthful or how environmentally friendly, people will not eat the food.\"</p><p>And insects would definitely not be an exception to that rule, suggested Diekman, who is also the former president of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.</p><p>\"If the taste is enjoyable, people might overcome the perception issue, but -- as with so many novel foods -- introduction would need to be gradual, [and] very much focused on taste and usage tips.\"</p><p>But dietitian Lona Sandon was not having it, pouring cold water on the notion of a plate of steaming hot grasshoppers.</p><p>\"The U.S. population in general is not ready for eating insects, myself included,\" said Sandon, program director of the department of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. </p><p>\"Until it becomes a cultural and socially acceptable food source, companies trying to sell insect flour or other insect-based foods will be facing a huge culture barrier to overcome in the U.S. market,\" she said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has more information on <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/edible-insects/en\" target=\"_new\">insects as food</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 3, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- If you think your nightly glass of vino is doing good things for your health, think again. </p><p>A new study suggests that folks who like to tip back a drink or two every day are more likely to die prematurely.</p><p>\"At any given age, if you drink daily -- even just one or two drinks -- you have a 20 percent increased risk of death compared to someone who drinks the same amount two to three times a week,\" said study author Dr. Sarah Hartz. She's an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.</p><p>\"We should no longer say that it's healthy to drink. It's a vice that's not great for us,\" she added. </p><p>Hartz noted that how significant a 20 percent increased risk of death is depends on your age. She explained that since very few people die in their 20s, a 20 percent increased risk of premature death is less significant at that age than it would be for someone in their 70s. </p><p>Although the study did find an association, it did not prove that light drinking caused early death risk to rise.</p> <p>But how might alcohol boost that risk? </p><p>Hartz said most of the increased risk of early death comes from an increased risk of cancer. She said that people often underestimate how much drinking can increase the risk of some cancers, such as breast cancer.  And drinking more than four times a week can also increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.</p><p>But what of all the studies that have suggested a health benefit from moderate drinking? </p><p>Hartz said that there have been several studies this year that have concluded that drinking generally isn't good for health. And the populations in these studies and the latest one are larger than in previous ones. More importantly, she noted, the newer studies have been able to parse out the lowest levels of drinking. </p><p>\"We have access to data we haven't had access to before,\" Hartz explained. </p><p>The study included information from more than 400,000 people. More than 340,000 (aged 18 to 85) had participated in a national health survey. Another group of nearly 94,000 were between the ages of 40 and 60 and had been treated as outpatients at Veterans Health Administration clinics. </p><p>\"The lowest risk group was people who drank one or two drinks just two to three times weekly,\" she said.</p><p>Still, not everyone is convinced that this study is the last word on alcohol and health. </p><p>According to Dr. Guy Mintz, director of cardiovascular health and lipidology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., \"The jury is still out with regard to frequency and quantity of alcohol use.\" </p><p>Mintz said, \"This is an interesting study. One to two drinks four days a week seemed to protect against cardiovascular disease, but drinking every day eliminated those benefits.\" </p><p>He pointed out that \"one of the study's conclusions was that, as medicine becomes more personalized, some patients with a history of cardiovascular disease may benefit from drinking two or three days a week, but those with a higher risk of cancer may not benefit.\" </p><p> Mintz tells his patients to drink anything but beer because it has a lot of calories and salt, and can contribute to obesity and high triglycerides (an unhealthy type of blood fat).  \"I would stress alcohol consumption in moderation, both in frequency and quantity,\" he said. </p><p>The study was published online Oct. 3 in the journal <i>Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about alcohol and its effects on the body from the <a href=\"https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/alcohols-effects-body\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Sept. 20, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Sleep apnea is a known risk factor for stroke, and new research suggests that curbing the condition might also aid the recovery of people who've suffered a stroke or mini-stroke.</p><p>Patients in the study typically used the  CPAP mask -- \"continuous positive airway pressure\" -- to ease their nighttime breathing difficulties.</p><p>The investigators found that, among stroke patients, \"treatment of sleep apnea with CPAP therapy provides significant benefits, even greater than the benefits of tPA, the FDA-approved drug treatment for stroke,\" said study lead researcher Dr. Dawn Bravata.</p><p>\"That's a substantial clinical effect,\" she said. \"The added good news for stroke patients is that CPAP has been used as a sleep apnea therapy for many years, and it has an excellent safety record.\"  Bravata is a research scientist with the Regenstrief Institute and Roudebush VA Medical Center in Indianapolis.</p><p>According to the researchers, sleep apnea is common among people who've had a stroke or mini-stroke, but few are currently diagnosed and treated for the condition. It's estimated that two out of three stroke patients are thought to have the condition, which causes irregular breathing during sleep. Sleep apnea can lead to low oxygen levels, high blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat.</p><p>In the new study, Bravata's group tracked outcomes for 252 people who had experienced a stroke or mini-stroke (known as a transient ischemic attack, or TIA) for up to one year. Patients were treated at one of five different hospitals in two states.</p><p>The patients were randomly divided into three groups: a control group who received standard care without sleep apnea treatment; standard care plus CPAP therapy; or enhanced care with CPAP therapy.  Patients who used CPAP did so for an average of 50 percent of nights.</p><p>The researchers reported that 59 percent of patients who received CPAP therapy showed marked improvement in their recovery, in terms of improvements in neurological symptoms. This compared with 38 percent of those who didn't get CPAP.</p><p>Timing of therapy may be key, as well, the study authors said.</p><p>\"Preliminary data suggests the sooner you treat sleep apnea in stroke patients with CPAP, the more potent the effect of that treatment,\" Bravata said in a Regenstrief news release.</p><p>\"Usually, diagnosing sleep apnea is an outpatient service. But we need to make sleep testing acutely available to stroke and TIA patients in the hospital as part of their work-up,\" she said, \"just as we do brain imaging, lab testing and cardiac monitoring as part of the initial stroke/TIA evaluation.\"</p><p>Two experts in stroke care believe the approach has real merit.</p><p>\"This study is very interesting --  it shows that a simple intervention, treating obstructive sleep apnea, can improve outcomes in stroke patients,\" said Dr. Andrew Rogrove. He is director of stroke services at Northwell Health's Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y.</p>  <p> Rogrove said it would be even more interesting to assess recovery rates when CPAP was used more frequently than the 50 percent of nights observed in this study.</p><p>Dr. Salman Azhar directs stroke care at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He noted that several studies have shown sleep apnea to be a factor in poor stroke recovery.</p><p>Testing for sleep apnea shouldn't add much to the burden of care for stroke survivors, Azhar added.</p><p> \"With the current ease of doing home sleep studies, the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea has become much simpler and should be considered in all stroke patients with positive screening questionnaire results,\" he said.</p><p>The findings were published earlier this month in the <i>Journal of the American Heart Association</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has more about  <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/sleep-apnea\" target=\"_new\"> sleep apnea</a>.</p>",

Cholesterol. Blood pressure. Obesity. It's common knowledge today that these all can lead to heart trouble. But in the 1940s, with one in two deaths caused by cardiovascular disease and even after President Franklin Roosevelt died from the effects of heart failure and a massive stroke, the information would have been considered revolutionary.</p> <p>The world has changed by leaps and bounds since Oct. 11, 1948, when, prompted by legislation signed after the president's death, researchers examined the first community volunteer for the Framingham Heart Study. The volunteer was one of 5,209 mostly white women and men who participated in physicals, lab samples and questionnaires, and who agreed to return every two years. About two-thirds of adults in the town took part.</p> <p>Since then, the FHS, now a joint project of Boston University and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, has taken in three generations of ever more diverse, and unpaid, participants. The study launched offshoots in 1994 and 2003 to include more races and ethnicities. That's 15,447 people of varying ages and backgrounds who are part of the science looking into the human genome, the brain and countless other high-tech side trips into the human body and the roots of disease.</p> <p>\"Every part of the body that can be measured, imaged or assessed, we've done so over the last 70 years,\" said Dr. Vasan S. Ramachandran, principal investigator and director of the study for Boston University. \"It's a remarkable human experiment. It's with humility I say that. It's unbelievable, and to be part of it is a gift, a privilege and an honor.\"</p> <p>Today, about one in three deaths in the United States are attributed to cardiovascular disease, about 2,300 people each day. And about 92.1 million adults are living with some sort of heart disease or after-effects of stroke. </p> <p>Framingham popularized the idea of cardiovascular risk factors, the conditions or behaviors that increase the chances of having a heart attack or stroke. FHS researchers published work homing in on those factors, such as high blood pressure, physical inactivity and excess weight. The study refined the idea of \"good\" and \"bad\" cholesterol. And as early as 1960, it pinned smoking as one of the culprits for heart disease.</p> <p>But the work continues to branch out from the heart to the brain, and even to the molecular level, adapting to the demands of science, said Ramachandran, who was hired as a Framingham researcher fresh out of cardiology training 25 years ago. \"When science has made something possible, we are there to leverage it in the study.\"</p> <p>Dr. Daniel Levy also was a young cardiology resident when he first visited Framingham to work on a research project. They hired him, and he said he felt like \"a kid in a candy store\" with all the work being done at the time in the 1980s on cardiovascular disease prevention. And now, as FHS director for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, he still sounds that way.</p> <p>\"When I started here 34 years ago, I couldn't have imagined I'd be doing some of the things I'm doing now,\" he said. \"We've gone beyond the heart to far-reaching programs in stroke and Alzheimer's to epigenetics, how environment changes how our genes work, to the next generation of risk factors and to understand the molecular basis of disease.\"</p> <p>As of August, FHS data has spawned 3,698 published studies in medical, peer-reviewed journals. The study has huge repositories of data, from cell lines and gene sequences to scanned images of the heart, brain, bone and liver. Researchers have conducted whole genome sequencing on about 4,000 people. Its brain research program already has received 230 brains from participants who have died, with 572 more participants signed up to donate theirs.</p> <p>Judie Saltonstall is one of them. She's a second-generation participant who moved to Arizona 29 years ago and still faithfully logs on to her computer every three months to answer questionnaires and memory quizzes. The 75-year-old is part of a contingent of FHS participants living all over the country who travel back to Framingham whenever needed for exams and tests. She reels off a list: retina photographs, bone density tests, and MRIs of the brain, heart and abdomen.</p> <p>\"It's kind of exciting to do,\" said Saltonstall, a mother of four and a former teacher. \"It's important for me personally, but also for them to know what's going on with me and to learn from that, whatever good it does.\" </p> <p>It's something John Stefanini, who still lives in Framingham, understands. He and his four older brothers all are part of the FHS. It's a source of pride, even if he sometimes gets puzzled reactions.</p> <p>\"The reaction sometimes is almost disbelief that you would allow someone to poke and prod and test you in such an invasive and transparent way,\" said the 54-year-old lawyer and former state representative. \"Why would you do that? You lose a day's work, or you have to sleep with wires attached to you for a few days, or you have to collect bodily fluids. But you do it with great pride because you are contributing to the health of the world. That's something we take very seriously.\" </p>",

The new report finds that white Americans will continue to comprise the majority of Alzheimer's cases, simply due to their sheer numbers. But minorities will be hit especially hard.</p><p>Among people 65 and older, blacks currently have the highest prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia at 13.8 percent, the CDC said. That's followed by Hispanics (12.2 percent), and whites (10.3 percent).</p><p>By 2060, the CDC researchers estimated that 3.2 million Hispanics and 2.2 million black Americans will be afflicted with Alzheimer's or a related dementia.</p>  <p>One reason for the increase in U.S. Alzheimer's cases could be inroads made against other diseases of aging. As people are able to live longer with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or diabetes, their odds for developing a dementia in old age rises, the CDC explained.</p><p>All of this means more Americans will also become caregivers for loved ones with dementia. That makes spotting the disease early even more important, Redfield said.</p><p>\"Early diagnosis is key to helping people and their families cope with loss of memory, navigate the health care system, and plan for their care in the future,\" he said in a CDC news release.</p><p>Planning can help ease caregiver burden, added study lead author Kevin Matthews, of the CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.</p><p>\"It is important for people who think their daily lives are impacted by memory loss to discuss these concerns with a health care provider,\" Matthews said. \"An early assessment and diagnosis is key to planning for their health care needs, including long-term services and supports, as the disease progresses.\"</p><p>The study was published online Sept. 19 in <i>Alzheimer's &amp; Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on Alzheimer's disease at the <a href=\"https://www.alz.org/\" target=\"_new\">Alzheimer's Association</a>.</p>",

The team looked for trends in sexual activity, use of birth control and exposure to sexual violence.</p><p>Their findings revealed a dramatic drop in the number of sexually active teens.</p><p>The study showed that 40 percent of U.S. high school students reported that they ever had sex in 2017. That's the lowest level of sexual behavior among teens since scientists began to keep track in 1991.</p><p>Fewer teens of all races and ethnicities reported having sex, the study showed. But the researchers noted this decline was most pronounced among black students.</p><p>Teens are more likely to become sexually active as they get older, the study showed. Just 20 percent of high school freshmen surveyed had ever had sex. The same was true for 57 percent of seniors.</p><p>Of the teens who said they were sexually active, nearly 90 percent used some form of birth control the last time they had sex. In 54 percent of these encounters, the teens used condoms. Only 16 percent of the sexually active girls and 10 percent of the sexually active boys surveyed admitted they had not used any contraceptive the last time they had sex. </p><p>Younger teens failed to use birth control more often: Roughly 20 percent of ninth-graders said they didn't use a contraceptive the last time they had sex, compared to 10 percent of seniors. </p><p>The researchers also found the use of long-acting reversible contraceptives (such as IUDs and contraceptive implants) among teens, which have become more popular among older women, jumped from 2 percent in 2013 to 5 percent by 2017.</p><p>Meanwhile, condom use dropped from 59 percent to 54 percent during this time frame. The researchers argued that teens need more education and access to condoms since rates of sexually transmitted diseases among young people are on the rise.</p><p>The study also revealed that sexual violence among teens has become more common.</p><p>In 2017, 10 percent of students reported experiencing sexual violence, such as forced kissing, touching or rape, in the past year.</p><p>The proportion of young women exposed to this abuse was three times as high as among boys. The proportion of students who identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual who faced this sexual violence was also nearly three times as high as heterosexual teens.</p><p>\"Consent is a critical component of sex education, not only to prevent sexual violence, but to promote healthy communication and development of fulfilling relationships,\" said Jesseca Boyer, a Guttmacher policy expert. \"All young people need and have the right to information, education, skills and services to support their sexual and reproductive health and well-being.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics provides more on <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/adolescent-sexual-health/Pages/Reproductive-Health.aspx\" target=\"_new\"> adolescent sexual health</a>.</p>",

And some kids get so upset that 1 in 5 parents say they find it hard to concentrate on what the doctor or nurse is saying. Some also say they had postponed a vaccination or canceled an appointment due to their child's fear.</p><p>The findings are from the University of Michigan C.S. Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health.</p><p>\"Regular checkups are vital during early childhood, not only because of important preventive services like vaccinations, but because they provide parents an opportunity to discuss health concerns with their pediatrician,\" poll co-director Sarah Clark said in a university news release.</p><p>\"If a child fears the doctor's office, health visits can be a challenging experience for the whole family,\" she said. </p><p>Fear of getting a shot (66 percent) and stranger anxiety (43 percent) were main reasons 2- and 3-year-olds were afraid, the survey found. Being scared of a shot was also the most common reason for fear among 4- and 5-year-olds (89 percent), followed by stranger anxiety (14 percent) and bad memories of being sick (13 percent).</p><p>And kids' distress is contagious. Nine percent of parents said they have sometimes avoided raising concerns or asking questions because their child was so upset during a doctor visit.</p><p>Four percent said they had delayed a vaccination, and 3 percent canceled a visit because of a child's fear.</p><p>\"Parents say the biggest source of fear is 'needle phobia,' which can be especially tricky for younger children who require vaccinations more frequently,\" Clark said. \"Children's fear of shots can be exacerbated when they pick up on their parents' anxiety and it can often be difficult to calm children down during these services.\"</p><p>She suggested parents ask health providers how to decrease children's fear of shots. Methods include parents hugging their child, distracting him or her with songs, a video, or even coughing briefly before the shot is given.</p><p>\"Telling the child there will no shots at the visit when the child is due for a vaccination or saying 'it won't hurt' may backfire and only increase anxiety ahead of future visits,\" Clark said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Nemours Foundation offers tips on <a href=\"https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/dr-visits.html\" target=\"_new\">preparing children for visits to the doctor</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Sept. 20, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- You might feel squeaky clean after that morning shower, but you carry an invisible cloud of bacteria, viruses, fungi and chemicals every day.</p><p>That's one of the lessons from the first study to take a deep dive into the human \"exposome\" -- the collection of microbes, plant particles and chemicals that accompanies people as they move through the world.</p><p>In fact, if your personal exposome was visible to the naked eye, the researchers said, you'd look like the \"Peanuts\" character Pig-Pen. </p><p>In the study, a small group of volunteers wore monitors with a special filter that trapped particles from the air around them as they went about their normal day.</p><p>When researchers did a genetic analysis of those samples, they found that each person carried a diverse cloud of bacteria, viruses, fungi, plant particles, chemicals and even \"microscopic animals.\"</p><p>But the exact makeup of that exposome varied substantially from person to person -- even though they lived in a fairly narrow geographic region (the San Francisco Bay area).</p><p>\"This is a very interesting study,\" said Dr. Aaron Glatt, chief of medicine at South Nassau Communities Hospital, in Oceanside, N.Y.</p><p>It's no secret that humans live in a world chock-full of invisible organisms and chemicals, said Glatt, who is also a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.</p><p>But this study offers a detailed look at individual exposomes, he said. And that could be a first step toward understanding the ways in which various environmental exposures affect human health, Glatt suggested.</p><p>\"That's what we believe,\" agreed senior researcher Michael Snyder, chair of genetics at Stanford University School of Medicine, in California.</p><p>\"Health is totally dependent on genes and environment,\" Snyder said. But it's clear that genes explain only a portion of a person's vulnerability to various diseases, he added.</p><p>There is still a huge amount to be learned about the effects of environmental exposures, Snyder said.</p><p>As an initial step, his team gathered detailed information from 14 people who wore matchbook-sized monitors on their arms for anywhere from a week to a month. Snyder, himself, wore the device for two years.</p><p>The devices contained filters that captured particulate matter from the surrounding air. Those samples were brought back to the lab for genetic analyses and chemical \"profiling.\"</p><p>In general, Snyder's team found, people's exposomes were diverse in the types of micro-organisms and chemicals they contained -- although the chemical DEET, an insect repellent, was ubiquitous.</p><p>\"It was everywhere, which kind of surprised me,\" Snyder said.</p><p>Otherwise, the makeup of the exposome seemed to depend on factors like weather, travel, pets and household chemicals, for instance.</p><p>Snyder said his own home exposures turned out to be \"very fungal, rather than bacterial.\"</p><p>He connects that to the use of \"green\" paint in his house. The paint lacks a substance called pyridine, which seems to keep fungus levels down. Snyder also discovered he was exposed to eucalyptus in the early spring -- which, he said, offers some clues to the culprit behind his seasonal allergies.</p><p>Several known carcinogens turned up in most of the chemical samples, according to the researchers. However, they only know the chemicals were present -- and not the amount of exposure.</p><p>If the idea of carrying around a cloud of bacteria, fungi and chemicals makes you cringe, Glatt made this point: Many of those exposures would be harmless or even beneficial.</p><p>It's known, for instance, that while some bacteria make people sick, many are \"good\" and necessary for human health.</p><p>Snyder agreed. For the most part, no one knows yet which components of the exposome are \"good\" and which are not, he said. And that may vary from one person to another, he added.</p><p>Complicating matters, a person's exposome is not static. It is \"dynamic,\" Snyder said, and constantly shifting over a lifetime.</p><p>That will make it challenging to study the ways in which the exposome affects human health, Snyder said. \"But I also think it can be done,\" he added.</p><p>He said his team plans to study larger groups of people in more-diverse environments. They also want to simplify the technology used in the study so that one day, people might be able to use the devices themselves, to track their own exposures.</p><p>The findings were published online Sept. 20 in <i>Cell.</i></p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/exposome/default.html\" target=\"_new\">human exposome</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Sept. 21, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The nightly dinner battles many parents have with picky toddlers can be exhausting. Now, research suggests that either pressuring or rewarding kids to eat healthier may backfire.</p><p>\"These practices can reinforce fussy eating, increase preferences for unhealthy foods, and lead to excessive weight gain,\" study author Holly Harris, from the Centre for Children's Health Research at Queensland University of Technology in Australia, said in a statement.</p><p>One U.S. pediatrician agreed.</p><p>\"Parents who address picky eating either with coercion or bribes may be setting the child up for problems down the road,\" said Dr. Michael Grosso. He's chair of pediatrics at Northwell Health Huntington Hospital in New York.</p><p>In the study, the Australian scientists followed more than 200 mothers and fathers. Their kids were between the ages of 2 and 5, and the families came from a poor area of Queensland.</p><p>Parents answered questions about themselves, their children, their children's eating habits, how they responded to their child's eating patterns, and whether or not they were worried about how their child ate.</p><p>Mothers and fathers seemed to agree on whether or not a child was a fussy eater. But mothers worried more about their child's eating behavior, and they were more distressed by crying, tantrums and gagging.</p><p>The researchers suspect the mother's extra concern may be why mothers were more likely to try to bribe or pressure a child into eating. Dads also tried to pressure their kids into eating. But the researchers said it wasn't due to concern about the child's fussy eating. Instead, the researchers believe fathers may be simply trying to shorten eating struggles.</p><p>So what can parents do to ease those mealtime showdowns?</p><p>Grosso and psychologist Judy Malinowski weighed in, and both agreed it's very important for parents to understand what's normal for their child's development.</p><p>\"Children go through numerous stages of development, and part of that involves a changing sense of taste. What they liked last week, they might not like this week, and it can be because of the texture, color or smell of a food,\" Malinowski explained. She's from Ascension Eastwood Behavioral Health in Novi, Mich.</p><p>Grosso said the biggest problem he sees with eating is that parents think children are eating too little food. But young children don't need a lot of food. </p><p>\"Most children will self-regulate their food intake appropriately,\" he said, adding that he often reassures parents by showing them their child is right where he or she should be on growth charts. </p><p>The next big issue, Grosso said, is power struggles. \"Toddlers are all about establishing their own sphere of autonomy, and of the few things toddlers can control is what they eat. If parents try to be too restrictive, kids will react,\" he said. </p><p>Both experts said the key is to offer choices. Grosso suggested only offering healthy choices, because \"given the choice between healthy and unhealthy, kids will eat candy bars before carrots.\"</p><p>He also recommended that children get age-appropriate servings of milk. \"Kids do need calcium and vitamin D, but they shouldn't get most of their calories from one source,\" Grosso said.</p><p>Malinowski advised involving kids in cooking meals when possible. She also suggested giving choices, such as, \"Do you want this food or that one?\" or \"Do you want a little or a lot?\"</p><p>Praise kids for trying new foods and for eating what was on their plate, Malinowski said. \"But don't punish or bribe for anything around food. This sets up the idea that one food is better than the other,\" she said.</p><p>And the good news is that most kids outgrow the fussy-about-food stage, or at least their pickiness tends to lessen as they get older, Grosso said. </p><p>The findings were published recently in the <i>Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Read more about helping a picky eater from the <a href=\"https://childmind.org/article/how-to-help-kids-who-are-picky-eaters/\" target=\"_new\">Child Mind Institute</a>.</p>",

They identified all hip fractures among dialysis patients reported between 2009 and 2014.

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 7, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Despite years of attention to the problem, U.S. hospitals have made little headway in preventing severe cases of bedsores among older Americans, a new study shows.</p><p>Researchers found that across hospitals in three states, the rate of bedsores among Medicare patients dropped by 40 percent between 2009 and 2014.</p><p>However, the picture looked less positive after the researchers did more digging. Nearly all of the decline was in early stage bedsores -- not the deep, severe wounds that can last for years.</p><p>Plus, the researchers said, it's hard to know how much of the decrease in early stage bedsores is \"real.\" The figures come from Medicare billing data -- which may not reflect the actual incidence of bedsores among hospital patients.</p><p>\"We're hoping it's a true decrease, but we can't actually tell,\" said senior researcher Dr. Jennifer Meddings, an associate professor at the University of Michigan Medical School.</p><p>The problem is, the overall rates of bedsores in the billing records were very low -- much lower than what Meddings' team found using a different data source.</p><p>That source, based on information from patients' medical charts, suggests that billing records captured only about 1 in 20 bedsores that Medicare patients actually suffered.</p><p>Bedsores -- known medically as pressure ulcers, or pressure injuries -- are caused by staying in one position for too long. They can affect people who are bedridden, use a wheelchair, or otherwise have difficulty moving.</p><p>Early stage bedsores may appear as red patches on the skin, or a wound that looks like a cut or blister. Advanced-stage injuries are large and deep, affecting tissue under the skin.</p><p>Pressure injuries are painful and can lead to serious, life-threatening infections, explained Janet Cuddigan, vice president of the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel. The panel is a nonprofit dedicated to preventing the injuries.</p><p>When the wounds are deep, they are also slow to heal, and leave people vulnerable to developing pressure injuries again, said Cuddigan, who was not involved in the study.</p><p>She said she was not surprised by the findings, because they echo what some previous research has shown.</p><p>But this study confirms the pattern in a broader population, Cuddigan noted. \"This heightens our awareness that more needs to be done to prevent pressure injuries,\" she said.</p><p>Hospitals have been trying, Cuddigan pointed out. One way, she said, is through \"early mobilization\" of patients, even in the intensive care unit.</p><p>Other measures include regularly cleaning and moisturizing patients' skin and providing enough protein, vitamins and minerals to keep the skin healthy.</p><p>And it's not only bed surfaces that can cause pressure injuries, Cuddigan explained. Tubes and other medical equipment can be culprits.</p><p>Meddings made the same point. If a patient needs an oxygen mask, for example, it can cause a pressure ulcer on the delicate skin behind the ear.</p><p>\"So every day, we need to check behind the ear,\" Meddings said.</p><p>In some cases, prevention is particularly tough. For example, Cuddigan said, a severely ill patient might have a drop in blood pressure each time staff members try a change in position.</p><p>And moving patients is not as simple as it might sound, Meddings said. It might require a whole \"repositioning team\" if a patient is quite heavy, for instance. Plus, there's skill and knowledge involved, Meddings noted. Patients are not simply \"turned,\" but repositioned in specific ways to limit their bedsore risk.</p><p>Family members can do a lot to help, however, Meddings said.</p><p>\"Ask questions,\" she advised. \"If there's any piece of plastic attached to the patient, you can ask, 'Is that still needed?' You can say, 'When I was helping him put on his sock today, I noticed a red spot on his heel.' \"</p><p>Meddings also recommended talking not only to your family member's doctor, but to the nursing staff, too.</p><p>\"They really are considered our skin care experts,\" she said.</p><p>Cuddigan agreed that families should feel free to speak up. \"We want you to be part of the team with us,\" she said.</p><p>The findings are in the November issue of <i>Health Affairs</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Library of Medicine has more on <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/pressuresores.html\" target=\"_new\">bedsores</a>.</p>",

Within 4.5 years, about 28 percent of the patients developed dementia.</p> <p>Researchers considered several factors for the progression and found that higher pulse wave velocity, which measures the elasticity of arteries, was a likely culprit. Arteries carrying oxygenated blood from the heart into the body can become stiff and lose elasticity with age, and the issue can be exacerbated when the vessels have plaque buildup.</p> <p>\"The identification of potential preventive strategies is crucial at early stages,\" said clinical pharmacist Laure Rouch, the study's lead author and a postdoctoral fellow at Universit&eacute; Descartes in Paris. \"Identifying (mild cognitive impairment) patients at higher risk of dementia using non-invasive techniques such as pulse wave velocity is a very interesting finding and also means that arterial stiffness may be a therapeutic target to delay or prevent the onset of dementia.\"</p> <p>In addition to pulse wave velocity to measure arterial stiffness, the study also looked at the thickness of the inner layers of the carotid artery to detect the buildup of fatty plaque. None of the other variables was associated with incidence of dementia.</p> <p>Rouch said pulse wave velocity appears to be a unique vascular biomarker that identifies patients with mild cognitive impairment who are at higher risk for dementia. But she stressed that needs to be confirmed by future studies.</p> <p>Arterial stiffness could expose the brain's blood vessel system to fluctuations in pressure and flow that cause tiny injuries, according to the study. Blood vessel stiffness has been related to atherosclerosis, or fatty buildup along artery walls. It's also been linked to arteriosclerosis, the thickening of blood vessels that can restrict blood flow and lead to stroke.</p> <p>About 48 million people worldwide live with dementia, a figure predicted to nearly double every two decades until 2050.</p> <p>Most people think of dementia as one condition and vascular disease as a separate one when there's actually \"tremendous overlap and interplay\" between the two, said Dr. Karen Furie, the neurology chair at the Alpert Medical School of Brown University.</p> <p>Furie, who wasn't involved in the new study, said the research provides a robust premise and conveys a compelling message.</p> <p>\"Controlling things like blood pressure and preventing vascular disease may not only prevent stroke and heart attack, it could also help prevent dementia,\" she said. \"It's very important for people to realize that there is that relationship, and what they do to keep their heart and brain healthy  may prevent or (slow) the development of dementia.\"</p> <p>The study should remind people how important it is to lower risk factors that are controllable, such as maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly and ditching cigarettes.</p> <p>When many people think of the aftermath of a stroke, a potential consequence of untreated risk factors, \"you picture the older person who is paralyzed and not necessarily the person who can move all their limbs but has dementia,\" said Furie, who chairs the AHA's stroke council. \"But in fact, that may be one of the manifestations of this interplay between vascular disease and other forms of dementia.\"</p> <p> Furie said that while scientists don't have a way to treat neurodegenerative illnesses yet, the diseases can be slowed down by controlling risk factors. And done well enough, it could be the closest thing to a cure, she said.</p> <p>\"It's amongst the possibilities, particularly if you intervene early enough, before damage is done. You could potentially have a significant effect in modifying the disease.\"</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY,  Sept. 21, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Contact lens wearers everywhere need to be on the lookout for a rare, but potentially blinding, eye infection, British researchers warn.</p><p>In southeast England, cases of the infection, called Acanthamoeba keratitis, have tripled since 2011, a new study found.</p><p>The illness is typically tied to poor contact lens hygiene use.</p><p>The infection combines a tiny single-cell amoeba with the bacteria keratitis. Once the eye is infected, it causes the the cornea to become painful and inflamed due to this cyst-forming microorganism.</p><p>For one in every four of people infected, the disease results in a loss of most of their vision or blindness and they face prolonged treatment, the research team said.</p><p>While rare, outbreaks have also occurred in the United States, one ophthalmologist said.</p><p>\"There have been a few outbreaks in the U.S., most notably from improper disinfection of contact lenses,\" said Dr. Jules Winokur, who practices at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He wasn't involved in the new study.</p><p>\"In clinical practice, we see cases of acanthamoeba on a regular basis, \" he said. \"Most often, these cases present in patients wearing contact lenses who have been exposed to contaminated water, which could be from swimming pools, water parks or even showers at home.\"</p><p>\"The treatment of acanthamoeba can be prolonged and difficult,\" Winokur explained. \"Toxic medications and even corneal transplantation may be necessary treatments.\"</p><p>The British study was led by Dr. John Dart, from University College London's Institute of Ophthalmology. His team collected data on patients seen from 1985 to 2016 at Moorfields Eye Hospital.</p><p>They found an increase in cases of the disease from the eight to 10 a year seen in 2000 -2003, to 36 to 65 cases per year more recently.</p><p>Overall, 25 percent of those affected required corneal transplants to treat the disease or restore vision, the researchers said. </p><p>Dart's team also conducted a second study, this time in people who wore reusable contact lenses daily. The study compared those 63 diagnosed with  Acanthamoeba keratitis with 213 people who went to the eye hospital for any other reason.</p><p>Dart's group found that the risk of developing the disease was more than three times greater among people with poor contact lens hygiene. This means people who didn't always wash and dry their hands before handling their lenses, or those who used a now discontinued disinfectant product containing Oxipol.</p><p>In addition, people who wore their contacts in swimming pools or hot tubs were also at risk, as were those who showered or washed their face while wearing their lenses, the study found.</p><p>\"People who wear reusable contact lenses need to make sure they thoroughly wash and dry their hands before handling contact lenses, and avoid wearing them while swimming, face washing or bathing,\" Dart said.</p><p>\"Daily disposable lenses, which eliminate the need for contact lens cases or solutions, may be safer and we are currently analyzing our data to establish the risk factors for these,\" he added in a university news release.</p><p>Dart stressed that \"this infection is still quite rare, usually affecting fewer than 3 in 100,000 contact lens users per year in South East England, but it's largely preventable.\"</p><p>\"This increase in cases highlights the need for contact lens users to be aware of the risks,\" he added. </p><p>Dr. Matthew Gorski is an ophthalmologist at Northwell Health in Great Neck, N.Y. He agreed that proper contact lens hygiene could prevent most cases of Acanthamoeba.</p><p>According to Gorski, that includes:</p><ul><li>Washing your hands with soap and water before handling contacts.</li><li>Properly disinfecting, cleaning and storing your contacts, including never using tap water to clean contacts.</li><li>Removing contacts from your eyes before water exposures such as swimming, showering or bathing.</li> <li>Removing contacts immediately and seeing your eye doctor if you have any eye pain, sensitivity to light, red eye or change in vision.</li></ul><p>The study was published Sept. 21 in the <i>British Journal of Ophthalmology</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on Acanthamoeba keratitis, visit the <a href=\"https://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/eye-and-vision-problems/glossary-of-eye-and-vision-conditions/acanthamoeba\" target=\"_new\">American Optometric Association</a>.</p>",

The nonprofit urges consumers to be extra cautious before deciding to use ground beef tucked away in the freezer.</p><p>\"<i>E. coli</i> O26 is quite serious. You don't want to risk your health, or your family's,\" said James Rogers, director of food safety testing and research at Consumer Reports.</p><p>The government last week said Cargill Meat Solutions was recalling more than 132,600 pounds of ground beef produced at its Fort Morgan, Colo., plant because of possible E. coli contamination. </p><p><i>E. coli</i> bacteria can cause severe cramps, bloody diarrhea and vomiting. At least one person has died as a result of the recent outbreak and 17 more were sickened, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Sept. 27, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Wearable defibrillators do not lower the chances of dying from sudden cardiac arrest among high-risk patients who've just had a heart attack, a new investigation concludes.</p><p>Worn externally as a vest, these defibrillators  are a noninvasive alternative to surgically implanted defibrillators. Both are designed to deliver a corrective electric shock to the heart if a heartbeat rhythm goes out of whack.</p><p>While implanted defibrillators are known to save lives in the months and years following a heart attack, \"prior clinical trials have found that implantable cardioverter defibrillators did not lead to a survival benefit in the first 40 to 90 days\" right after a heart attack, said cardiologist Dr. Gregg Fonarow.</p><p>So guidelines prohibit implantation during the first 40 days after a heart attack, or during the first 90 days among patients who've had bypass surgery or stent implantation, explained Fonarow. He is director of the Ahmanson-UCLA Cardiomyopathy Center and co-director of the UCLA Preventative Cardiology Program in Los Angeles, and was not involved with the new study.</p><p>According to Fonarow, despite a lack of solid proof, many cardiologists have operated under the assumption that wearable defibrillators could pick up the lifesaving slack in those early days after a heart attack.</p><p>Why? On the one hand, cardiac arrest is a big public health concern. Cardiac arrest, which is not the same as a heart attack, is caused when the heart's electrical system malfunctions and the heart stops beating properly.  The American Heart Association estimates it affects more than 350,000 non-hospitalized Americans every year.</p><p>What's more, Fonarow stressed that the risk of cardiac arrest is \"relatively high\" in the immediate aftermath of a heart attack, particularly among those diagnosed with low \"ejection fraction\" (EF). In such patients, the heart's left ventricle pumps out a relatively low amount of blood with every heartbeat.</p><p>In the new study, all 2,300 patients had an EF of 35 percent or less within a week after being discharged from the hospital following a heart attack. (A normal EF hovers between 50 to 65 percent).</p><p>About two-thirds of the study patients were trained to use a \"LifeVest,\" a combination harness/vest that is worn underneath clothing. One-third received usual care.</p><p>On average, the vest group wore the device 14 hours a day for up to three months. However, usage steadily decreased from 18 hours a day on average to 12 hours a day, and by the study's end half the patients had stopped wearing it altogether.</p><p>Perhaps in part for that reason, the study team ultimately found no evidence that the vest helped to lower sudden cardiac death risk.</p><p>Fonarow described the study as \"well conducted,\" and suggested that it's a good example of the fact that \"many therapeutic strategies that seem plausible don't actually work out the way intended when subjected to a rigorous clinical trial.\"</p><p>Dr. Richard Page, who co-authored an editorial accompanying the study, suggested the findings are far from clear-cut.</p><p>Page noted, for example, that the study team also found that vest wearers saw their overall risk of dying from any cause drop by 35 percent.</p><p>Exactly why remains unclear. And Page acknowledged that while he \"would like to say that the device played a role, we can't, because it's not the endpoint that the study was designed to test.\"</p><p>But Page said he would still prescribe the vest \"for a patient who I feel is at high risk and is highly motivated to wear the device.\"</p><p>\"This study was a heroic effort. But there is no question that these kinds of patients are at high risk for sudden cardiac arrest and death,\" said Page. He is a clinical cardiac electrophysiologist and chair of the department of medicine at the University of Wisconsin's School of Medicine and Public Health.</p><p> \"And during this window of time after a heart attack, they are not eligible for an implantable device,\" he continued.</p><p>\"But this wearable device -- if you're actually wearing it -- likely offers a very good chance, and almost your only chance, for saving your life if you have a cardiac arrest,\" Page said.</p><p>The study was led by Dr. Jeffrey Olgin, who is chief of the division of cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco Center for the Prevention of Sudden Death.</p><p> Olgin and his colleagues published their findings in the Sept. 27 issue of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>. The research was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and LifeVest manufacturer Zoll Medical Corp.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on sudden cardiac arrest at the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cardiac-arrest\" target=\"_new\">American Heart Association</a>.</p>",

Ditto a parent seeking antibiotics for their child for chronic Lyme disease.</p><p>None of these treatments are proven to be of value, experts note.</p><p>But this new study illustrates a grave \"potential for misinformation and 'fake news' to spread,\" said Dr. Vineet Arora, a professor of medicine at the University of Chicago. </p><p>The report warns that many Americans use crowdfunding websites such as GoFundMe to perform end-runs around their doctors and insurance carriers in order to finance medical procedures that can be untested, ineffective and/or potentially dangerous.</p><p>\"It's a huge trend,\" said study lead author Dr. Ford Vox, a brain injury specialist at the Shepherd Center in Atlanta. </p><p>Vox and his colleagues reviewed medical postings from November 2015 until December 2017 on four American and Canadian crowdfunding sites: GoFundMe, YouCaring, CrowdRise and FundRazr.</p><p>They zeroed in on campaigns for five medically unsupported \"treatments\" in eight countries: homeopathy or naturopathy for cancer; hyperbaric (atmospherically pressurized) oxygen therapy for brain trauma; stem cell therapy for brain injuries; stem cell therapy for spinal cord injuries, and long-term antibiotic therapy for chronic Lyme disease.</p><p>Despite a lack of evidence supporting these therapies, researchers found that more than 1,000 campaigns raised more than $6.7 million. Ninety-eight percent of the postings appeared on GoFundMe, and the cumulative goal was to raise more than $27 million.</p><p>At the high end, nearly 500 funding pleas for homeopathic/naturopathic cancer treatments took in more than $3.4 million, the researchers found.</p><p>Nearly 200 campaigns for hyperbaric oxygen therapy raised about $785,000. Requests to fund stem cell therapy for brain and spinal cord injuries drew more than $1.8 million. And controversial long-term antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease raised about $689,000.</p><p>Those numbers, said Vox, reflect the rise of an \"explosive\" and unregulated market for accessing treatments that are neither safe nor effective. \"Ultimately, there is a lot of legal but bad medicine out there,\" he added.</p><p>Assuming the money went where it was promised to go, donors \"indirectly contributed millions of dollars to practitioners to deliver dubious, possibly unsafe care,\" Vox and his research team wrote in a letter published Oct. 23 in <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>.</p><p>Vox and others agree there are plenty of legitimate medical crowdfunding requests.</p><p>But medical crowdfunding \"erodes public trust in the medical and scientific enterprise, if it brings attention to treatments that are not supported by science,\" said Arora, who wasn't involved in the study. \"This erosion can also make it harder to advance trust when treatments are [effective].\"</p><p>Vox said crowdfunding sites \"need to recognize the potential downside and accept a certain level of responsibility.\" He suggested they work with the academic and bioethics community to determine how best to move forward.</p><p>Arora added that \"the public has a right to unbiased and accurate information about both the proven risk and benefit of medical treatments.\" Ensuring that, she said, may require new regulations. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Cancer Institute talks about <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient\" target=\"_new\">complementary cancer treatments</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Sept. 26, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- If you're worried that too much \"screen time\" could be sapping your child's intelligence, new research suggests you might be right.</p><p>Kids with the sharpest intellects spent less than two hours a day on their cellphones, tablets and computers, coupled with 9 to 11 hours of sleep and at least an hour of physical activity, the study found.</p><p>Unfortunately, very few U.S. children meet all three of these daily goals, said lead researcher Jeremy Walsh, a postdoctoral fellow with the CHEO Research Institute in Ottawa, Canada.</p><p>\"Only 5 percent of our sample met all three guidelines,\" Walsh said.</p><p>About 41 percent met one of the guidelines and 25 percent met two, he continued.</p><p>\"That means 30 percent of our sample didn't meet any of the guidelines, which I think is a very important statistic to focus on,\" Walsh said.</p><p>The study is based on data gathered from over 4,500 U.S. kids aged 8 to 11 between September 2016 and September 2017 as part of a new, federally funded 10-year study on brain development and child health.</p><p>Walsh and his colleagues used the data to see if children are limiting their screen time while also getting enough sleep and exercise, based on Canadian guidelines published in 2016.</p><p>Half of the children got the recommended 9 to 11 hours of sleep, 37 percent met the screen time guideline of less than two hours, and 18 percent got an hour or more of exercise. On average, the kids in the study spent 3.6 hours a day engaged in screen time.</p><p>The study couldn't prove cause-and-effect, but the more individual recommendations a child met, the better their ability to think and reason. That's what the researchers found when they compared guideline adherence against performance on brain exercises (\"cognition\").</p><p>\"For every additional recommendation met, children had significantly better cognition compared to those who did not meet any of the guidelines,\" Walsh said.</p><p>Kids who met the sleep and screen time guidelines appeared to have the best intellects, followed by the kids who met just the screen time guidelines, the findings showed.</p><p>Too much screen time could be wrecking kids' ability to focus, especially if they are switching between apps on a device or between different screens at the same time, Walsh suggested.</p><p>\"One leading hypothesis is that a lot of time on screens is spent multitasking, using multiple apps or devices at once,\" Walsh said. \"This can interfere with a child's ability to focus and sustain interest on a task.

That can mean impulse buying, high credit card debt and little savings for a rainy day.</p><p>But you don't have to dampen an outgoing personality. Just take steps to keep it from making you financially poor.</p><p>First, set a financial goal, whether it's to buy a house, start a retirement fund or get out of credit card debt. Then work on a plan to reach that goal. People who write out their plan are twice as likely to actually save money.</p><p>Of course, to be able to put any funds aside, you need to create a budget. Include your income, how much you spend and on what. You can do this with an app, an Excel spreadsheet or an old-fashioned paper ledger.</p><p>Now look for ways to fill the piggybank. You can start small.</p><ul><li>Pay off your credit cards with the highest rates and switch to a credit card that pays you back a percentage of your purchases. </li><li>Change banks for lower fees. </li><li>Find areas where you can cut back, such as expensive morning coffee shop stops and how often you eat lunch out. </li><li>Put loose change in a jar at the end of every day and, once a month, take it to the bank.</li></ul><p><b>More information</b></p><p>AmericaSaves.org, a project of the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America, has detailed ideas to <a href=\"https://americasaves.org/for-savers\" target=\"_new\">help you save</a>, from setting a goal to ways to reach it.</p>",

On Wednesday, the prestigious JAMA network of journals retracted six more academic papers produced over the years by Wansink's lab at Cornell.</p> <p>One paper, published in 2005, had found that people eat more when served in large bowls; another, published in 2013, found that shoppers buy more high-calorie foods when they are hungry.</p> <p>In Cornell's announcement, the university said Wansink's academic misconduct included \"problematic statistical techniques, failure to properly document and preserve research results, and inappropriate authorship.\" Critics claim Wansink \"cherry-picked\" data to help support previously determined conclusions -- a no-no in academic research.</p><p>Cornell said Wansink will spend the remainder of his time at the university cooperating with the ongoing review into his research.</p><p>Wansink on Wednesday issued a statement saying he was retiring after 14 years, but did not respond to emailed requests from the <i>AP</i> for further comment.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Ground Beef Recalled After E.Coli Outbreak</b></span></p><p>More than 132,000 pounds of ground beef have been recalled by a Colorado company following an outbreak where one person was killed and 17 were sickened by E. coli after eating the meat.</p><p>Cargill Meat Solutions said in a statement Thursday that  all of the affected products have been removed from supermarket shelves, and food safety teams are checking the Fort Morgan facility where the meat was packaged \"to ensure we continue to deliver safe food.\"</p><p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture said the meat was produced and packaged at that facility on June 21 and shipped to stores all over the country, the <i>Associated Press</i> reported.</p><p>The products included 3-, 10- and 20-pound packages of ground beef and sold under the brands Our Certified, Excel, Sterling Silver, Certified and Fire River Farms.

She's a lecturer in the University of Limerick's psychology department.</p><p>The study findings echo previous research \"showing that individuals with visible physical distinctions, which are viewed negatively by society, can experience impaired psychological and physical well-being as a result,\" O'Donnell said in a university news release. </p><p>Acne isn't only a teen problem. The skin condition affects almost 13 percent of adults aged 59 and older and more than 1 in 10 kids between ages 5 and 13, the study authors said.</p><p>For the new report, the authors surveyed almost 300 people with the blackheads and pimples that characterize acne. They found that those who perceived the most acne-related stigma had more psychological distress and physical symptoms such as trouble sleeping, headaches and digestive issues.</p><p>Women reported more severe symptoms than men. And acne severity correlated with the quality-of-life issues and mental distress, though only an association rather than a cause-and-effect link was seen.</p><p>Facebook and other social media may indirectly reinforce perceptions of acne stigma, the researchers said.</p><p>\"Like many physical attributes that are stigmatized, acne is not well represented in popular culture, advertising or social media. This can lead people with acne to feel that they are 'not normal' and therefore negatively viewed by others,\" said study co-author Jamie Davern, a Ph.D. student also at the University of Limerick. </p><p>Davern said the findings are important for health care providers and anyone who has a loved one dealing with acne.</p><p>\"The wider negative impacts some acne sufferers experience are very challenging and require sensitivity and support,\" he added.</p><p>The study was published online Sept. 28 in <i>PLOS ONE</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The American Academy of Dermatology provides more on <a href=\"https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/acne-and-rosacea/acne\" target=\"_new\">acne</a>.</p>",

While fat in general has gotten a bad rap, some types of fat -- particularly plant-based fats -- are good for you in moderation.</p><p>Good-for-you fats:</p><ul><li>Olive, flaxseed oil and other plant-based oils.</li><li>Fatty fish.</li><li>Avocados.</li><li>Walnuts, other nuts and their oils.</li><li>Sunflower seeds and other seeds.</li></ul><p>Based on their chemical composition, plant-based fats are either monounsaturated or polyunsaturated, though many have a combination. Both types have health benefits. Olive oil is the top choice among the mostly monounsaturated fats, which also include canola and peanut oils, avocados, walnuts, and many other nuts and seeds. Flaxseed in particular is exceptionally rich in ALA, or alpha-linolenic acid, one of the omega-3 fatty acids. Grind the seeds before you eat them or use flaxseed oil to get the most nutrients.</p><p>Plant foods high in polyunsaturated fats include soybean and sunflower oils, and some nuts and seeds. But one of the healthiest sources of polyunsaturated fats are fatty fish because they contain the other important omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The best fatty fish are salmon, tuna, trout, mackerel, sardines and herring.</p><p>The fats to limit are saturated fat, found mostly in animal foods such as red meat, full-fat dairy, butter and lard.</p><p>The fats to completely avoid are trans fats, which are oils that undergo a process that extends their shelf life, but makes them extremely unhealthy. Manufacturers are in the process of removing them from foods, but check labels because the deadline to fully comply with this U.S. Food and Drug Administration ruling has been extended to 2020.</p><p>Fats do help you feel more satisfied, but they're also the most calorie-dense foods, so watch quantities, even when choosing the best sources.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart Association has detailed information on <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/HealthyEating/Nutrition/FATS-The-Good-the-Bad-and-the-Ugly-Infographic_UCM_468968_SubHomePage.jsp\" target=\"_new\">good and bad fats</a>, including ones to completely avoid.</p>",

Many said they'd refused or delayed treatments, failed to pay non-medical bills, or been contacted by collection agencies.</p><p>It all amounts to a \"financial toxicity,\" experts said, that could take a toll on patients' mental and physical well-being.</p><p>The costs of cancer go well beyond paying for medical care, said lead researcher Stephanie Wheeler, an associate professor of health policy and management at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.</p><p>Patients may have to travel long distances to their cancer center, pay for lodging or arrange for child care or care for elderly parents -- to name just a few expenses.</p><p>So, having health insurance is no guaranteed protection, Wheeler said.</p><p>In fact, the study found, breast cancer patients with health insurance actually reported more distress over their financial situation, versus those who were uninsured.</p><p>It's a surprising finding, Wheeler said. But she speculated on some potential explanations: For one, women with insurance may have been taken off-guard by high out-of-pocket expenses. And some may have had to spend down assets they'd built over years -- which can be \"very distressing,\" Wheeler pointed out.</p><p>Caitlin Donovan is a spokesperson for the Patient Advocate Foundation, a nonprofit that offers financial assistance and other services to people with serious chronic diseases.</p><p>It was no surprise to her that many women in this study faced financial woes.</p><p>\"To us, there's no difference between the 'direct' and 'indirect' costs of medical care,\" Donovan said. \"We've found that one of the biggest [financial] concerns people have is transportation.\"</p><p>If you live far from your treatment center, the cost of gas alone can be daunting, Donovan noted.</p><p>And even if you live in a city and take the subway, she added, there's the time off from work -- whether it's for the patient or family member -- and possibly additional expenses like child care.</p><p>The strain of dealing with all of that can take a toll on patients, both emotionally and physically, Donovan said.</p><p>\"That's why they call it financial toxicity,\" she said. \"It affects the 'whole' person.\"</p><p>The findings are based on 1,054 U.S. women with metastatic breast cancer -- which means the disease has spread to distant sites in the body, like the bones or brain. Close to half had been living with it for one to two years, while around one-quarter were at the two- to five-year mark.</p><p>Overall, the study found, nearly 70 percent of the patients said they were worried about financial problems related to their cancer.</p><p>Many women -- 35 percent -- lacked health insurance, and nearly all of those women said they had delayed or refused a treatment. That was true for 41 percent of insured women, the findings showed.</p><p>It's not clear what type of care the women put off, or when, Wheeler noted.</p><p>\"But it's absolutely concerning,\" she said.</p><p>In addition, about three-quarters of uninsured women said they'd been contacted by a collections agency, while 40 percent had skipped paying non-medical bills.</p><p>Insured patients also reported those problems, albeit at lower rates. And when it came to the emotional strain from financial worries, they tended to be faring worse than uninsured women.</p><p>It's a striking finding, Donovan said. And she agreed that insured patients may be less prepared, mentally, for the financial toll.</p><p>\"Anecdotally,\" Donovan said, \"patients are often surprised by what their insurance plan doesn't cover.\"</p><p>The picture is not all bleak, Wheeler stressed. \"The good news,\" she said, \"is that there are financial resources -- at hospitals, in the community, and even from industry.\"</p><p>She cited the Patient Advocate Foundation as one national group. She suggested, though, that patients \"start at the place where they're receiving care.\"</p><p>Large cancer centers will generally have more financial assistance programs, Wheeler noted. But smaller hospitals usually have resources, too -- such as social workers who can help families navigate the financial side of care.</p><p>Wheeler did, however, point to a shortcoming: \"Many of the resources that exist are limited to uninsured patients. And clearly, patients with insurance need help, too.\"</p><p>Donovan agreed, and said the \"disjointed\" nature of the U.S. health care system sets up roadblocks. Many patients either have difficulty accessing the financial services that are out there -- or are not aware of them at all, she added.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Patient Advocate Foundation has a guide for women with <a href=\"https://www.patientadvocate.org/wp-content/uploads/Metastatic-Breast-Cancer-Guide.pdf\" target=\"_new\">metastatic breast cancer</a>.</p>",

This new understanding has changed our whole outlook on how to take care of patients with congenital heart disease,\" said the statement's lead author, Dr. Mary Ella Pierpont, a pediatrician and a professor of pediatric genetics and metabolism at the University of Minnesota.</p> <p>The summary covers a broad spectrum of topics and new advancements in genetic conditions, including a phenomenon called copy number variation, or CNV, when the number of copies of a particular gene varies from one person to the next. The statement also offers updated information on new molecular testing techniques and how they apply to congenital heart disease and other congenital anomalies or syndromes.</p> <p>\"If doctors know the cause of their patients' conditions, they can make a better long-term medical management plan, provide better care and the promise of a healthier life,\" Pierpont said. \"For example, certain types of congenital heart disease could be associated with rhythm disturbances, and knowing the gene abnormality can help the physician evaluate for the possibility of arrhythmia.\"</p> <p>New genetic testing techniques help pinpoint a prognosis for congenital heart disease, assess risks for the patient's children and other close relatives, and alert doctors to associated medical conditions that may need attention.</p> <p>The statement helps doctors \"think about things in the context of a family, not just the individual in front of you,\" said Dr. Carolyn Ho, medical director of the Cardiovascular Genetics Center at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School.</p> <p>Ho, who was not involved in writing the report, said \"the types of genetic anomalies that underlie congenital heart disease are incredibly diverse, and this statement does a good job of saying which types of genetic testing you can have, based on the broad range of genetic changes and how it can lead to congenital heart disease.\"</p> <p>The statement discusses new prenatal gene testing techniques that have emerged in recent years to better inform doctors and parents who may be concerned about the increased risks for women who have congenital heart disease and for their baby.</p> <p>\"The statement is not dogmatic, saying you <i>must </i>or <i>should </i>be tested -- but you do need to be educated so you can make a good decision for yourself and your family,\" said Dr. Wendy K. Chung, a statement co-author and a clinical and molecular geneticist and professor of pediatrics at Columbia University. \"The statement is saying it's important for parents to see professionals who are experienced in the prenatal setting, such as a genetic counselor and/or geneticist.\"</p> <p>Newer prenatal tests include non-invasive cell-free DNA testing, which is conducted by blood sample from the mother, and chromosomal microarray, or CMA, testing. Testing is done after an amniocentesis, a procedure which can carry a small risk of miscarriage. The statement says CMA tests are warranted, either prenatally or postnatally, for people with certain types of congenital heart disease.</p> <p>\"The cell-free DNA test can detect some things associated with congenital heart disease, but the chromosome microarray test gives you more information,\" said Chung. \"Looking forward, there are much more powerful technologies that we currently use prenatally in research studies. There's a lot coming down the pike very quickly.\"</p> <p>Pierpont agreed, but she expressed concern that key research on congenital heart defects may go unfunded, including studies on how non-cardiac diseases might be associated with congenital heart disease.</p> <p>\"Adult heart disease and cholesterol gets the bulk of the funding in heart disease, but we also need improved research for congenital heart disease,\" she said. \"This paper shows there's a lot happening. It's a very important area for future research.\"</p>",

However, makers of generics don't have to repeat the clinical trials done on the originals.</p><p>To be approved by the FDA, a generic must show \"bioequivalence\" -- there can't be a significant difference from the brand in the rate and amount of absorption of the drug when given in the same dose under similar experimental conditions.</p><p>Here are the FDA's generic drug rules:</p><ul><li>The drug must contain the same active ingredients as the brand-name drug.</li><li>The drug must be identical in strength, dosage, form and route of administration.</li><li>It must be absorbed into the bloodstream at a similar rate and over the same period of time.</li><li>It must be manufactured under the same strict standards of brand-name drugs.</li><li>The drug must meet the same requirements for identity, strength, purity and quality.</li></ul><p>Though rare, sometimes a generic fails to perform like the brand. In 2012 some patients didn't get the same results from generics of a common antidepressant and had new or worse side effects. Testing ultimately found they were not bioequivalent to the brand. Soon after, to increase safety, the FDA began a $20 million program for widespread testing of generics made here and in other countries that sell here, notably India.</p><p>In January 2016, a study on the value of generics concluded that, by and large, there are no significant differences in outcomes between generics and brands.</p><p>Some physicians simply prefer to prescribe newer medications, which can be very expensive, even when an older generic has been shown to work.

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Sept. 21, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Have you ever left a doctor's appointment with only a vague idea of what was said? You're not alone: A new survey finds many Americans, and their doctors, are turning to recordings for help.</p><p>Researchers found that almost 30 percent of the doctors they surveyed had ever recorded a visit for a patient's use. And about 19 percent of U.S. adults said they'd done so themselves -- usually after asking the doctor's permission.</p><p>Since smartphones are ubiquitous, it's easier than ever to make such recordings, said study author Paul Barr, an assistant professor at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice.</p><p>But it hasn't been clear how often patients are doing it -- or whether many doctors are OK with it, said Barr.</p><p>Based on his team's findings, most patients and doctors are at least interested in the idea.</p><p>\"Clinicians are open to doing this,\" Barr said. \"I hope this helps raise awareness that this is an option for patients, if they're interested.\"</p><p>Research shows that people forget up to 80 percent of the information they hear during an average medical visit. But, Barr said, research also shows that recordings can help make up for fuzzy memories.</p><p>Dr. Colleen Silva specializes in treating breast cancer at the University of Texas Medical Branch, in Galveston. For nearly a decade, the center has offered cancer patients recorders to tape their visits if they wish.</p><p>A cancer diagnosis itself can be devastating, Silva pointed out. On top of that, patients may need to digest an avalanche of information on their treatment options.</p><p>\"They can be so overwhelmed, they just shut down,\" Silva said. That's where recorded visits can make a big difference.</p><p>\"Anecdotally, I can tell you that patients really appreciate having these. I've had many who say this helps them recall information,\" Silva said.</p><p>Plus, she added, patients can share the recordings with family members who weren't able to accompany them to the appointment.</p><p>Barr agreed that the ability to share information with family can be one of the big advantages of recording doctor visits.</p><p>The findings, published recently in the <i>Journal of Medical Internet Research</i>, are based on two surveys: One focused on 456 U.S. doctors in various specialties; the other included a nationally representative sample of 524 adults.</p><p>Just over 28 percent of doctors said they'd ever recorded a visit for a patient to use. It was most common among specialists who, like Silva, treat cancer: Almost half of oncologists said they'd recorded appointments.</p><p>The practice was also common among doctors who specialized in physical rehabilitation -- with 42 percent saying they'd ever recorded visits.</p><p>As with cancer care, Barr said, that makes sense, because physical rehab may involve a lot of information to absorb. Studies have found, for example, that patients often prefer to have a video of their provider demonstrating exercises, versus getting written instructions only.</p><p>Of the respondents from the general public, almost one-fifth said they'd ever recorded a medical appointment. Most had done it with their doctor's permission -- but nearly 3 percent said they'd secretly recorded a visit.</p><p>Why they'd chosen the covert route is unclear.</p><p>But if some patients are worried about asking their doctor to record a visit, this survey offers some good news, according to Barr. While about 70 percent had never recorded an appointment, half of those doctors said they'd be willing.</p><p>\"I think patients should absolutely feel they have the power to ask, if they want to,\" Silva said.</p><p>A recording might not be needed if you're visiting the doctor for an infection, Silva noted.</p><p>\"But I could see this being useful any time a patient has a chronic medical condition that requires more complex, long-term management,\" she said.</p><p>Barr agreed, and said that older adults -- who often have multiple health conditions and difficulty remembering medical information -- may find recordings especially helpful.</p><p>Some doctors in the survey did bring up one concern: The possibility that recorded discussions could end up being used against them in a lawsuit.</p><p>Silva said that in her center's experience, that theoretical downside has not become a reality.</p><p>\"So far, in nine-plus years, this has not come up as a problem,\" she said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has tips on <a href=\"https://www.ahrq.gov/patients-consumers/patient-involvement/ask-your-doctor/index.html\" target=\"_new\">talking to your doctor</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Oct. 4, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- In 2016, almost 174 Americans died each day due to drug overdoses -- and roughly two-thirds of those deaths were caused by opioid drugs. The statistics are startling and make the problem seem hopeless.</p> <p>But is it?</p><p>Beating drug addiction -- whether it's opioids (such as OxyContin), methamphetamine or something else -- is definitely a challenge and an ongoing process. Recovery often doesn't occur with just one attempt. People often relapse one or more times during the process, according to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse.</p><p>But it is possible to recover from even the most serious of addictions.</p><p>Just ask Katelyn and Jeffrey Hoglund -- a Cincinnati-area couple. Before they met, they were both so far gone into addiction that their daily lives revolved solely around getting the next fix.</p><p>Today, they're celebrating five years drug-free and their first wedding anniversary (they met in recovery). Both have good jobs and they just purchased a new house to give their five dogs more room to roam.</p><p><b>Paths to addiction</b></p><p>Their journeys weren't without trouble though. \"I had zero belief that I could be anything but a dope fiend when I was using,\" Katelyn said.</p><p>Both Katelyn and Jeffery were somewhat surprised by how easy it was to get addicted.</p><p>For Katelyn, it started with a party where she took some opioid pain pills. She liked the high and started using them more and more. She said she was naive and didn't realize that the pills were addictive.</p><p>\"I thought, 'These are made in a lab. They must be OK.' But one day I woke up feeling really sick,\" she said. \"I didn't know it at the time, but I was dope sick. Later that day, I got some pain pills, and I vividly remember that I felt better, and then I thought, 'Uh-oh.' \"</p><p>But she still kept using, and said it was probably only a month or two before she knew she was addicted. The real turning point was when she crossed from pain pills to using a needle to inject heroin. \"At that point, any semblance of my life was shattered,\" she said.</p><p>Katelyn said she used for probably five years, and during that time was arrested a few times, including for stealing a large sum of money from her parents.</p><p> \"Everything finally started to catch up on me,\" she said. \"I would wake up in the morning and be angry that I had woken up, that I hadn't overdosed. I knew I couldn't continue to live that way.\"</p> <p> Katelyn turned herself in and was given a chance to go to an inpatient treatment center instead of jail.</p><p>Jeffrey's story is similar. He was very close to his parents, especially his Dad. In 2001, he found out his Dad had pancreatic cancer. He was devastated. A friend said to him, \"Buddy, you don't have to feel this.\" That was the first night he ever tried hard drugs.</p><p>\"The drugs brought me everything I didn't know I was looking for, and from that point until 2013 -- 12 years -- it didn't matter what drugs I could get as long as I didn't have to feel,\" Jeffrey said.</p><p>Like Katelyn, he said any semblance of his former life vanished once he crossed the line into injecting drugs. Jeffrey also was arrested and entered drug rehab multiple times before he finally took recovery seriously.</p><p><b>Support key to recovery</b></p><p>What made the last visit to rehab the one that stuck?</p><p>Jeffrey said he's not entirely sure, but thinks the weekly visits from his mother helped. His mother encouraged him and said she saw something changing in him. \"I always thought I would die a junkie. But seeing myself through her eyes allowed me to see myself as something better,\" he said.</p><p>Marjorie Clifton, executive director of the Center for Safe Internet Pharmacies, said what many people don't understand about opioid addiction in particular, is that the drugs rewire your brain.</p><p>\"People addicted to opioids aren't looking for the high; they're trying to avoid the dope sickness. They get so sick when coming off the high that they will do anything to keep from feeling it, and it's something you cannot understand unless you've been through it,\" Clifton said.</p><p>Fred Muench, CEO of the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids, and himself a recovering addict, said the stigma surrounding addiction is a huge problem.</p><p>\"I've heard people say, 'Why should you resuscitate addicts who've overdosed?' because people believe addiction is a choice. But addiction is a disease, and however that disease gets triggered, we need to stop blaming the individual and seeing addiction as a moral failure. Addiction is the only disease we treat with jail,\" he said.</p><p>Muench said if you have insurance, you'll likely have treatment options. Success rates between inpatient and outpatient treatment aren't drastically different, but whatever your choice, be sure to research the treatment center and make sure its marketing isn't making wild promises. Family members can help with this research if they want to be involved, he suggested.</p><p>People without insurance must rely on state and local government programs. These programs often have waiting lists, he noted.</p><p>Muench also encourages family members to not give up, even if your loved one has tried over and over again to get off drugs. But, he added, it's important to set boundaries, and support doesn't necessarily mean giving someone money.</p><p>\"Understand that you reaching out to help can change someone's life. When I couldn't give myself hope, others around me who could see I wasn't a bad person, just someone struggling, gave me hope. It can get you from feeling suicidal to getting into treatment,\" Muench said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about safe medicine use and what treatment options are available for people addicted to drugs from <a href=\"https://medicinesafe.org/\" target=\"_new\">MedicineSafe</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 3, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Among the most significant advances in surgery has been the development of laparoscopic -- or minimally invasive -- procedures.</p><p>These are new ways to perform many standard operations, with a few, very small incisions, often barely a half-inch long, compared to traditional so-called open surgery with one incision several inches long.</p><p>To perform an operation this way, the surgeon inserts a laparoscope, a thin tube with a tiny camera at the tip, through one incision to visualize the area of concern. Images from the camera are seen on a monitor. The surgeon uses them to guide tiny surgical instruments through other incisions and do the operation.</p><p>A few small incisions can mean less pain, fewer visible scars and potentially faster healing. You can often go home the same day and get back to many normal activities sooner. There's also less chance of internal scar tissue, called adhesions, which can be painful.</p><p>For the surgeon, one advantage is that the images are magnified on the monitor, making it easier to see organs and tissues. However, laparoscopic procedures can take longer than open surgery, and longer time under anesthesia may increase the risk of complications, such as internal bleeding or infection, which might take days or weeks to appear.</p><p>While many complex surgeries must be done the traditional way, minimally invasive surgery is now routine for many health issues.</p><p>Laparoscopic surgery is available for:</p><ul><li>Many gynecological and urinary procedures.</li> <li>Hernia repair.</li><li>Gallbladder removal.</li><li>Some infertility treatments.</li><li>Bariatric, prostate and some colon surgeries.</li></ul><p>Always check the credentials of your surgeon.

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Oct. 4, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Researchers have proposed a unique study in humans to reduce the early onset of atherosclerosis, the buildup of the artery-clogging plaque that can lead to heart attacks and strokes.</p> <p>The report, published Oct. 4 in the <i>Journal of the American Heart Association</i>, reviews a host of previous research and proposes a new clinical trial to reduce apolipoprotein B, also called apo B lipoproteins, in young and middle-age adults. Over the past few decades, research has pointed to this group of blood proteins, which includes LDL, or \"bad cholesterol,\" as the main culprit in the beginnings of atherosclerosis.</p> <p>\"Lowering them may have a big impact on making atherosclerosis go away,\" said study lead author Dr. Jennifer Robinson, a professor of epidemiology and director of the Prevention Intervention Center at the University of Iowa. \"If this works, you could completely eliminate heart attacks and strokes within a generation, because you can't have a heart attack or stroke unless you have atherosclerosis.\"</p> <p>The proposed trial, CURing Early ATHEROsclerosis, or CURE ATHERO, would set out to determine if atherosclerosis in high-risk adults aged 25 to 55 might be reversed by using medicines called statins and PCSK9 inhibitors over the course of three years.</p> <p>\"The idea is to get the cholesterol very low for a short period of time, let all the early cholesterol buildup dissolve, and let the arteries heal,\" Robinson said, adding that this approach has worked well in animal studies. \"Then patients might need to be retreated every decade or two if the atherosclerosis begins to develop again.\"</p> <p>Lipoproteins are tiny, complex particles that transport fat and cholesterol through the blood. \"There are a lot of different types of lipoproteins, but the ones that have apolipoprotein B on them are the ones that cause atherosclerosis,\" said Dr. John Wilkins, a cardiologist and assistant professor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.</p> <p>Wilkins, who wasn't involved in the report, called the proposal a \"very compelling idea\" that might show whether older adults can avoid heart attacks and strokes by making sure they have low LDL and apo B levels earlier in their lives.</p> <p>\"It's a very important question that we really need to answer, because we have therapies now to lower apo B lipoproteins and LDL cholesterol,\" said Wilkins, who has conducted research on apo B lipoproteins.</p><p>\"We know that people who have low LDL cholesterol for genetic reasons have a very low risk of having cardiovascular events, so if we can replicate one of these genetic states and get people's LDL cholesterol really low in early adulthood, perhaps these people won't have downstream complications like heart attack and stroke,\" Wilkins added.</p> <p>The proposed trial would face certain challenges, including reluctance among young, seemingly healthy adults to take medication, Wilkins said. Another possible obstacle is the length of the study.</p> <p>\"Atherosclerosis develops over decades. It's going to be very difficult to conclusively link a treatment strategy in people in their 30s or 40s to a reduction in risk 20 or 30 years later,\" Wilkins said. \"You would have to treat people and then follow them for 20 to 30 years, and that type of study design just isn't practical.\"</p> <p>Doctors aren't currently advised to test patients' apo B levels, Robinson said, because routine LDL cholesterol tests and other measures already give doctors information to assess cardiovascular risk.</p> <p>But she said she hopes the proposed trial will show that lowering apo B levels early in life will help people who are genetically inclined to have high cholesterol, as well as those with health problems caused by a poor diet, obesity and lack of exercise.</p> <p>\"People should do as much as they can with lifestyle, but it's really hard to have a healthy lifestyle in modern society,\" Robinson said.</p> <p>A clinical trial could pave the way for a new generation of therapies to fight heart attacks and strokes, she said.</p> <p>\"Once you know what causes something, you can come up with a hammer for it and eliminate it. We're not the first ones to think of this idea. This would be the culminating study of decades of research by thousands of people. But I'm excited about this, and I think it's really time to pursue this hypothesis.\"</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Oct. 4, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Big cities with a large commuting workforce tend to have longer, more grinding flu seasons, a new study suggests.</p><p>Researchers found that a city's flu season is apt to last longer as its population increases and workplaces become more focused within a few key spots, said lead researcher Benjamin Dalziel, a population biologist with Oregon State University.</p><p>\"Larger cities have more organized movement patterns, and these patterns connect pockets of high population density together,\" Dalziel said. \"We found this structure makes a difference for how the flu spreads at different times of the year.\"</p><p>Armed with this knowledge, public health experts could better predict how bad a flu season is going to be by looking at early infection rates in big cities, said co-researcher Cecile Viboud. She is a staff scientist with the Fogarty International Center at the U.S. National Institutes of Health.</p><p>\"If we could strengthen surveillance in these cities, we would have an earlier window on the severity of epidemics, and we may use those data to help predict epidemics on a regional or national scale,\" Viboud explained.</p><p>Such an edge could be critical given that U.S. health officials announced just last week that influenza killed an estimated 80,000 Americans during last winter's flu season, making it the deadliest season in more than four decades.</p><p>A particularly virulent flu strain, H3N2, rampaged across the country during the 2017-2018 season, causing a record number of deaths and hospitalizations, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.</p><p>Compounding the problem, flu vaccination rates also dipped last year, officials noted, leaving more people vulnerable to the virus and making flu shots even more imperative this flu season.</p><p>In general, the flu season spikes during the winter due to lower humidity, Dalziel said.</p><p>\"Flu spreads from person to person by virus-bearing moisture droplets that an infected person exhales or coughs or sneezes out. This creates what you can think of as a moving cloud of risk around an infected individual,\" Dalziel said.</p><p>During the winter, humidity decreases \"and this causes the virus to remain viable in the air for longer, which effectively expands that cloud of risk,\" he explained.</p><p>But in larger cities where people are packed in tight, the dry winter weather matters less, the researchers found.</p><p>\"If an infected person is sitting right beside you, it matters less what the specific humidity is,\" Dalziel said. \"It helps the virus find a host even when climactic conditions are not at their most favorable.\"</p><p>Dalziel and his colleagues combined six years of data on influenza cases with census data showing where people live and work in 603 different cities across the United States.</p><p>The investigators found that in large metropolitan areas, flu cases are more spread out, including early and late in the season when weather is not the best for transmission. New York City and Miami are examples of cities that have a more prolonged flu season, the study authors said.</p><p>On the other hand, smaller cities tend to have short flu seasons tightly grouped around the usual peak in winter. Atlanta and Nashville are examples of this, where the flu hits during in a more concentrated period.</p><p>The researchers noted that the risk for getting the flu remains the same in all cities.</p><p> Viboud said, \"This does not show that some cities are safer than others for flu. Rather, it shows the relative difference in the timing of cases.\"</p><p>The data show that public health officials need to take their metropolitan area's structure into account when planning for each flu season, the researchers suggested.</p><p>Larger cities with a longer flu season will need to prepare for cases to start appearing earlier, for example.</p><p>\"In contrast,\" Viboud said, \"in smaller cities a more intense outbreak may overload the health care system, making it particularly challenging to respond to epidemics.\"</p><p>The study shows how the rise of megacities could make a new flu pandemic more likely, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore. He was not involved with the new study.</p><p>\"Influenza in large cities behaves differently with longer transmission chains, prolonged seasons and less vulnerability to changes in humidity versus smaller cities,\" Adalja said. </p><p>\"This study underscores the need for pandemic preparedness efforts to be heightened in the biggest cities of the world, for they may be the major drivers of the looming influenza pandemic,\" he added.</p><p>The study was published Oct. 5 in the journal <i>Science</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">influenza</a>.</p>",

Trying to compensate, the heart begins to pump inefficiently and in consequence becomes enlarged and misshapen.</p><p>At the same time, these changes begin to wear on the mitral valve, which guides blood flow from the heart's left atrium into its left ventricle. This can cause a \"back up\" of blood within the heart, worsening the heart's inefficiency and exacerbating heart failure.</p><p>While medicines can slow heart failure, its progress is relentless and there's been little else to offer patients. Almost 2 million Americans have severe heart failure, which seriously limits daily activity.</p><p>But the new study, funded by the device's maker, Abbot, offers renewed hope. Doctors used the device, called MitraClip, to join two wayward flaps of the damaged mitral valve together in the middle. This appeared to restore regular function to the valve, researchers said.</p><p>The trial included 614 patients with severe heart failure in the United States and Canada.  They were randomly assigned to receive either the MitraClip plus standard therapy or standard therapy alone.</p><p>Among those half of patients who didn't get the device, 151 were hospitalized for heart failure over the next two years, and 61 died.  That's compared to just 92 hospitalizations for patients who received the clip, 28 of whom died.</p><p>\"This is a game changer. This is massive,\" Dr. Matthew Williams, who directs the heart valve program at NYU Langone Health in New York City, told the <i>Times</i>.</p><p>The hospital had a few patients in the study, which was published Sunday in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> and presented simultaneously at a European heart meeting.</p><p>The MitraClip costs about $30,000, the <i>Times</i> said. Experts believe that, if approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the device would probably be covered by Medicare.</p><p>In the surgery, doctors guide the tiny device to the heart via a blood vessel in the groin.</p><p>Dr. Gregg Stone, of Columbia University Medical Center and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, led the new trial. He believes the device might also prove a less invasive alternative for people who aren't candidates for mitral valve replacement surgeries.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Sept. 24, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Following years of decline, fatal car accidents involving teen drivers have accelerated in the United States, a leading group of U.S. pediatricians warns.</p><p>New research also reveals that teenage drivers are more likely to be involved in a serious or deadly crash than any other age group, notes the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p><p>The group has updated its 2006 policy statement on teen driving to focus on new threats facing inexperienced drivers.</p><p>\"We all know how easy it is to become distracted while driving, particularly in the age of texting and technology,\" said statement author Dr. Elizabeth Alderman. \"Parents can set a powerful example with their own driving habits, from using a seatbelt regularly to avoiding cellphone use or speeding.\"</p><p>The new policy statement followed a review of 2014-2016 national accident data.</p><p>\"Every state has some form of graduated driver's licensing regulations, which have helped improve safety by limiting the number of passengers or restricting night-time driving,\" said statement co-author Dr. Brian Johnston. \"Yet more can be done. One step that could make a difference is for communities to more consistently enforce laws on seat belts and use of cellphones while driving,\" he said in an academy news release.</p><p>In 2015 alone, nearly 1,900 teen drivers died in car crashes -- a 9 percent jump from the year before. And nearly 200,000 young drivers were hurt in car accidents.</p><p>Inexperience plays a role in these accidents. The AAP found the risk of a car accident or close call is four times higher for teenagers who got their license within 18 months. Driving too fast, driving with other teens in the car, being distracted and driving under the influence of alcohol, drug or medications are other risks, the experts warned.</p><p>Teens who drive their friends around are more likely to get into an accident, the academy noted.</p><p>The driving risks may be even higher for teens with medical concerns, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), concussions or sleep apnea. These health issues could affect their ability to drive safely, the group says.</p><p>There are steps doctors can take to boost the safety of teens behind the wheel. The AAP recommends the following:</p><ul><li>Remind teens to always wear a seat belt. And inform young people about the risks of driving while under the influence of alcohol, drugs or medication. </li><li>Urge parents to go beyond state requirements for drivers' training: Exceed the minimum amount of supervised driving with your teens and practice in a variety of conditions and situations. </li><li>Encourage using safe alternative routes to school to shorten driving time.  </li><li>Support later school start times so that teens are well-rested.  </li><li>Study the effectiveness of graduated driver's licensing rules, to determine if these laws should be expanded to include new drivers who are 18 or 19. </li></ul> <p>\"For many teenagers, driving is an important rite of passage,\" Alderman said. \"We want to help them navigate this new privilege safely. Families can ask their pediatrician to share in a conversation with their new driver to set expectations and decrease risks.\"</p><p>The statement was published online Sept. 24 in <i>Pediatrics</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides more information on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/teen_drivers/index.html\" target=\"_new\"> teen drivers</a>.</p>",
