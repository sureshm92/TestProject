Have more family meals, even if your family isn't particularly close, new research suggests.</p><p>\"Gathering around the dinner table is sort of a magical thing,\" said lead researcher Kathryn Walton, a dietitian and Ph.D. student at the University of Guelph in Canada.</p><p>\"It's a time when families can slow down from their busy days to talk, spend time together and problem-solve. It's also a time that parents can model healthful eating behaviors,\" Walton said in a university news release.</p><p>The study included more than 2,700 young people, aged 14 to 24, who were living with their parents. They were asked how often they sat down for dinner with their families, how well their family functions, and about their eating habits.</p><p>Teens and young adults who ate with their family more tended to eat more fruits and vegetables and less fast or takeout food. This happened regardless of how families managed daily routines, communicated and connected emotionally, according to the researchers.</p><p>Published Nov. 21 in the journal <i>JAMA Network Open</i>, the study couldn't prove that family dinner caused teens to become healthy eaters, only that there was an association.</p><p>Still, \"to reap the many benefits of family dinners, the meal doesn't have to be a big drawn-out affair,\" said study co-author Jess Haines, a professor of family relations and applied nutrition at Guelph.</p><p>\"Even if it's something you pull out of the freezer, add a bagged salad on the side and you'll have a decent nutritional meal,\" Haines said.</p><p>Walton also noted that when teens and young adults help prepare food, they are more likely to eat it and learn important food skills.</p><p>\"Our research found that family dinners are a great way to improve the dietary intake of the whole family, regardless of how well the family functions together,\" Walton said. \"Preparing and enjoying a meal together can also help families bond.

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Dec. 4, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- A new gene therapy shows early promise against sickle cell anemia, researchers say.</p><p>The therapy targets the genetic flaw that causes sickle cell. In a small group of patients, researchers said the therapy appears safe and effective enough to keep moving forward into larger trials.</p><p>\"We've been talking about using gene therapy for sickle cell anemia for years. Now it's finally coming of age,\" said Dr. John Tisdale, a scientist with the U.S. National Institutes of Health who is leading the ongoing research.</p><p>Sickle cell anemia is an inherited disease that mainly affects people of African, South American or Mediterranean descent. In the United States, about 1 in 365 black children is born with the condition, according to the NIH.</p><p>It arises when a person inherits two copies of an abnormal hemoglobin gene -- one from each parent. Hemoglobin is an oxygen-carrying protein within red blood cells.</p><p>When those cells contain \"sickle\" hemoglobin, they become crescent-shaped, rather than disk-shaped. They tend to be sticky and can clot -- causing symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath.</p><p>Many people with sickle cell also suffer bouts of severe pain due to poor blood circulation. Over time, the disease can damage organs throughout the body, leading to complications like kidney disease and stroke.</p><p>\"It's a devastating disease,\" Tisdale said. \"People often die early, in their 40s.\"</p><p>He presented the preliminary results this week at the American Society of Hematology's annual meeting, in San Diego.</p><p>There are treatments, such as the cancer drug hydroxyurea, which can help prevent severe pain and certain other complications. But the medications don't change the course of the disease.</p><p>There is one way to \"fix\" it, Tisdale said: a bone marrow transplant.</p><p>The procedure destroys a person's existing bone marrow stem cells -- which are producing the faulty red blood cells -- and replaces them with stem cells from a healthy donor.</p><p>The problem, Tisdale said, is that the donor has to be a genetic match (usually a sibling) who is free of sickle cell.</p><p>\"That covers about 10 percent of patients,\" he said. \"We need something for the other 90 percent.\"</p><p>That's where gene therapy could come in. Tisdale explained the basics: First, doctors remove a supply of blood-forming stem cells from the patient, before using chemotherapy to wipe out the remaining stem cells.</p><p>Next, they use a modified virus to deliver a \"therapeutic\" gene into the extracted stem cells. The gene is an \"anti-sickling\" version of the beta globulin gene, which is mutated in sickle cell.</p><p>Those genetically modified stem cells are then infused back into the patient -- with the aim of repopulating the body with normal red blood cells.</p><p>Tisdale's team initially treated seven patients with severe sickle cell who'd suffered complications from the disease. The gene therapy did produce new red blood cells, but at fairly low levels. So the researchers tweaked the procedure, and tested it in six other patients.</p><p>Of those patients, four had been followed for about three months on average as of May 2018. By that point, all had at least as many normal red blood cells as sickle-affected cells.</p><p>\"We're also seeing a resolution of anemia and pain,\" Tisdale said.</p><p>The short-term side effects included fever caused by a drop in white blood cells, inflammation in the mouth, and chest pain.</p><p>This is not the first report of gene therapy being used for sickle cell. Last year, French researchers described the case of a teenage boy who was doing well 15 months after receiving gene therapy.

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Dec. 4, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- As many as 4 out of 5 Americans withhold important information from their doctor that could prove crucial to their health, a new study shows.</p><p>Between 60 and 80 percent of people admit they avoid telling their doctor details that could be relevant to their well-being.</p><p>\"I know at some level this is a 'no duh,' of course, people mislead, but I was surprised how pervasive it is,\" said senior researcher Angela Fagerlin, chair of population health sciences at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. \"A lot of people are not fully honest with their provider. They don't tell them all the information they could tell them.\"</p><p>Shame and fear appear to be at the root of this lack of communication, the researchers found.</p><p>Patients don't want to admit that they disagree with their doctor or don't understand what the doctor has told them, Fagerlin said. People also don't want to fess up about their unhealthy behaviors.</p><p>But keeping this information secret can lead to some very dire consequences.</p><p>American Academy of Family Physicians President Dr. John Cullen recalled a situation years ago when a patient with apparent appendicitis was being prepped for surgery.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, methamphetamine can sometimes present the same way as appendicitis,\" said Cullen, a family physician in Valdez, Alaska, with more than 25 years of experience. \"As we're getting ready to take him to the operating room, I remember saying, 'We're about to cut you open here. Are you sure you don't want to tell me anything else?' </p><p>\"That's when we found out about the methamphetamine use,\" Cullen continued. \"Indeed, that was the cause, and we stopped the surgery.\"</p><p>Sharing information can also help doctors prevent drug interactions, or change a patient's treatment plan so he or she will be more likely to comply with it, Fagerlin said.</p><p>For the study, Fagerlin and her colleagues surveyed two different pools of patients, 4,510 in all.</p><p>One group had an average age of 36, while the other had an average age of 61. The younger group of patients consistently tended to withhold information more often than the older folks, 81 percent and 61 percent, respectively.</p><p>The most common thing people don't tell their doctor is that they don't agree with the physician's recommended course of treatment, the researchers found. About 46 percent of people in the younger group and 31 percent in the older group said they'd done this.</p><p>This is not good because people who disagree with their doctor might not follow through on taking prescribed medications or receiving recommended follow-up tests, Fagerlin said.</p><p>Second most often, people wouldn't admit that they didn't fully understand the instructions a provider gave them. That happened with 32 percent of younger patients and 24 percent of older patients.</p><p>After that, patients most often withheld information about personal habits that could be unhealthy -- poor diet (24 percent for younger and 20 percent for older patients), not taking medication as prescribed (22 and 18 percent), not exercising (22 percent in both groups), or taking someone else's prescription medication (14 and 9 percent).</p><p>The researchers also asked why patients didn't tell the whole story, and the No. 1 reason was that they didn't want the doctor to give them a hard time about their behavior (82 and 64 percent)</p><p>\"They didn't want to get a lecture from their doctor,\" Fagerlin said. \"They didn't want to get scolded.\"</p><p>Other reasons included:</p><ul><li>I didn't want to hear how bad a behavior is for me (76 and 61 percent).</li><li>I was embarrassed to admit something (61 and 50 percent).</li><li>I didn't want the provider to think I'm a difficult patient (51 and 38 percent).</li><li>I didn't want to take up any more of the provider's time (45 and 36 percent).</li><li>I didn't think it mattered (39 and 33 percent).</li><li>I didn't want the provider to think I'm stupid (38 and 31 percent).</li><li>I didn't want this information in my medical record (34 and 31 percent).</li></ul><p>That last reason is particularly important in the new age of electronic health records (EHRs) that are easily swapped between doctors, said Cullen, who wasn't involved in the study.</p><p>\"I think EHRs worry people,\" Cullen said. \"A lot of times I'll make a point of saying, 'This will not go on the record' and close up my computer, so they know what they're telling me is privileged information. In a small town, that's really important.\"</p><p>Doctors can help their patients air disagreements or misunderstandings regarding their treatment by asking for feedback, Fagerlin said.</p><p>\"Providers can do things like say, 'I just gave you a whole bunch of information and I know it's really confusing, and I'm not sure I did it in the best way. Can you let me know what you heard from me to make sure I got it right?' \" Fagerlin said. \"Or they can ask, 'Do you agree with this or do you think another route of care might be better?' \"</p><p>Such back-and-forth is \"really the essence of the patient-physician relationship,\" Cullen said.</p><p>\"This is the art of medicine right here, and this is why it's so important to have a physician you can relate to and who is engaged in that two-way communication,\" Cullen said.</p><p>The new study was published Nov. 30 in the journal <i>JAMA Network Open</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians has more about <a href=\"https://www.aafp.org/dam/AAFP/documents/medical_education_residency/fmig/tips_relationships.pdf\" target=\"_new\">doctor/patient relations</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 14, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Born weighing almost 10 pounds, Caden Konecny arrived pink and loud. His mom, Ashlea, loved everything about her first-born child, except his struggles to breastfeed.</p> <p> Perhaps she was doing something wrong?</p> <p> At Caden's six-week checkup, he was down to 7.5 pounds. A few weeks later, a bad cough landed him in the hospital.</p> <p>\"He sounded like an old man trying to breathe,\" Ashlea said. </p> <p> Doctors suspected that Caden had bronchitis. Soon, a doctor noticed something wrong with his heart. A pediatric cardiologist became involved, prompting more tests.</p> <p> Hours later, Ashlea and her husband Paul learned that Caden needed open-heart surgery.</p> <p> Caden was born with one artery exiting his heart instead of two. Of all heart defects babies can be born with, this happens in less than 1 percent of them. </p> <p> The condition is called truncus arteriosus. The pulmonary artery and aorta begin as one vessel, then divide into two as the heart develops. Caden's never divided, so he was missing the pulmonary artery that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. </p> <p> During the operation, doctors would create a new pulmonary artery. They also would patch another problem, a hole between the heart chambers that allowed oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood to mix. </p> <p> Adding to the drama, such a procedure couldn't be done at their local hospital in Derby, Kansas. Caden had to be transported to Kansas City, three hours away.</p> <p> The surgery went well, or so it seemed. </p> <p> After his breathing tubes were removed, the patch to the hole became dislodged. A second surgery was needed to repair that. Six weeks later, they returned home to recover, but that was short-lived. Something still didn't seem right, and after a weekend with baby Caden screaming nonstop, they drove the three hours back to Kansas City. </p> <p> Doctors said Caden was in heart failure again. He had his second open-heart surgery, repairing the new pulmonary artery. His chest was too swollen to close after surgery, so doctors covered it with bandages overnight. </p> <p> During the night, his heart stopped beating, and doctors manually massaged his heart for 45 minutes before it restarted. He spent the next eight days connected to a machine that breathed and pumped blood for him. </p> <p>\"They talked about possibly having to turn off the machine if things did not improve,\" Ashlea said. \"They talked about how he could have brain damage because he had CPR for so long.\" </p> <p> Three and a half months after Caden was hospitalized for his first heart surgery, he went home. Unlike that initial trip home with a fat, seemingly healthy baby, the Konecnys faced all sorts of challenges.</p> <p> Caden had a feeding tube and required twice-daily injections of blood thinners, as well as other medications. He couldn't hold up his head or roll over like other kids his age, and he couldn't swallow because his vocal cords were temporarily paralyzed. A variety of specialists visited the house to help him overcome those challenges.</p> <p> Fortunately, their hard work -- and Caden's -- helped him recover. He started eating solid food and eventually only took water pills and blood pressure pills. When he started school, he got extra help, as children who have been on a heart and breathing machine often have learning and processing difficulties. </p> <p> In 2015, Caden turned 9. He'd outgrown the pulmonary artery doctors had put in, so he needed a new one. That required his third open-heart surgery.</p> <p> Ashlea was scared, of course, remembering all that went wrong last time and the challenges of recovery.</p> <p> The worry was for naught. </p> <p> Surgery was uneventful and now Caden, who turns 12 this month, is off all medications. He visits the cardiologist only once a year for a checkup.</p> <p> As he grows into his adult height, he'll eventually need yet another pulmonary artery. </p> <p>\"I don't think about it much,\" Caden said, \"though I'm a little worried about it.\"</p> <p> Caden continues to stay busy with school, playing the violin, reading and playing board and computer games. He even learned to crochet like his mom, and is making a blanket. While his younger brother Cameron is usually found outside playing sports, Caden isn't interested -- a good thing considering he's not allowed to play high-contact sports.</p> <p>\"I like making movies and writing historical military fiction,\" Caden said.</p> <p> Caden and his family have participated in the Wichita Heart Walk since he was 2, several times as the child spokesperson. He was also part of an American Heart Association survivor campaign with his maternal grandmother, who also had open-heart surgery when she was a child. </p> <p> Ashlea often talks to other \"heart moms\" when they need support for a child's congenital heart defect. About 40,000 U.S. babies are born each year with a heart defect, about eight in every 1,000 babies. </p> <p> Through her crochet community, Ashlea has shared Caden's story and a heart surgery doll she made to include tubes, bandages and an incision. She modified the original doll design for those who want to help friends or families going through heart surgery, or to donate to a children's hospital. </p> <p>Caden's heart problems have taught her to be more accepting and less judgmental of others. And \"I value the friends we've made because of this,\" Ashlea said.</p>",

The children's mental health was tracked from birth until they averaged about 10 years of age.</p><p>Christensen's group concluded that \"maternal use of valproate  during pregnancy was associated with a small but significantly increased risk of ADHD in the offspring, even after adjusting for maternal psychiatric disease, maternal epilepsy,\" and other factors.</p><p>Other epilepsy drugs appeared to have no effect on ADHD rates, the researchers noted. The findings were published online Jan. 4 in <i>JAMA Network Open</i>.</p><p>Two U.S. experts said that most women with epilepsy are already counseled to avoid valproate during  pregnancy.</p><p>\"This study provides yet more data highlighting risks of using valproate in women of childbearing age,\" said Dr. Fred Lado, who directs epilepsy care for Queens and Long Island as part of the New York City Northwell Health system.</p><p>According to Lado, it's been long known that \"valproate produces birth defects in up to 10 percent of children exposed in utero.\" The drug also \"reduces average IQ [in exposed offspring] and increases the likelihood of behavioral problems,\" he said.</p><p>The new study \"adds to the already compelling list of reasons for avoiding valproate use in women of childbearing age,\" Lado said.  In most cases, women can switch to another anti-seizure medicine, but \"in the rare cases where there is no alternative to valproate, women should be informed fully about the risks and counseled on the use of contraceptives,\" he added.</p><p>Dr. Andrew Adesman is chief of child developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Children's Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park.  He said the new study \"once again raises the concern that prenatal exposure to valproate puts a fetus at increased risk of ADHD as a child.\"</p><p> Adesman stressed that while avoidance of valproate is the preferred option during a pregnancy, women who have taken the drug while pregnant should not panic.</p><p>\"It must be kept in mind that, despite the increased risk of ADHD, only about 10 percent  of children exposed to valproate prenatally ended up having ADHD,\" Adesman said. \"So, women who were treated with valproate during their pregnancy should be reassured by the fact that the chances are pretty small that their child will have ADHD as a function of valproate exposure during pregnancy.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/index.shtml\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. National Institute of Mental Health</a> for more on ADHD.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Jan. 7, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Parents of kids with Down syndrome often worry whether their children can develop life skills, but new research suggests that the picture is far from bleak.</p><p>\"More and more parents are opting for prenatal testing during their pregnancies, and if they learn about a diagnosis of Down syndrome they want to know real-life answers to such questions,\" said Dr. Brian Skotko. He is director of the Down syndrome program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.</p><p>\"Contrary to some public beliefs, people with Down syndrome never stop learning, and functional skills can still be attained and improved well into adulthood,\" he said in a hospital news release.</p><p>For the study, Skotko and colleagues combined the results of surveys of more than 2,600 families in the United States and the Netherlands.</p><p>The U.S. survey, conducted in 2009, asked parents to rank their child's functional abilities in 11 areas: walking; eating; speaking; grooming and personal hygiene; reading; writing; preparing meals; working at a job; going on dates; traveling alone; and living independently.</p><p>Parents were also asked if their child had significant health problems or learning difficulties.</p><p>The same questionnaire was completed by Dutch families in 2016.</p><p>For both groups, the ages of the family members with Down syndrome ranged from under 5 to over 40, with the largest number in the younger age groups.</p><p>The results showed that most people with Down syndrome in the United States could walk by 25 months, speak reasonably well by age 12 years, maintain personal hygiene by 13 and work independently by 20.</p><p>By age 31, nearly half were reading reasonably well, 46 percent could write reasonably well, 34 percent were living independently, and about 30 percent could travel independently, the findings showed. </p><p>Dutch parents reported largely similar results.</p><p>Learning problems were reported more often than health problems, and serious health problems increased with age, the researchers found.</p><p>\"Now we have guideposts -- based on the responses of thousands of parents -- that can help clinicians know when children may be falling behind their peers with Down syndrome and, when necessary, refer parents to additional supports, resources and therapies,\" Skotko said.</p><p>In America, \"wrongful birth\" and  \"wrongful life\" lawsuits have been filed by parents of children with Down syndrome or on behalf of the children. These suits claim that they were not given information allowing them to terminate a pregnancy or that the child is living a life of suffering, Skotko said.</p><p>\"These headline-grabbing lawsuits center around basic questions, such as what a person with Down syndrome can reasonably be expected to achieve. Such discussions should be centered around accurate information, rather than wild, outdated speculation, and we hope our research will help give clearer answers to those questions,\" he explained.</p><p>The report was published online Jan. 2 in the <i>American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on Down syndrome, visit the <a href=\"https://www.ndss.org/about-down-syndrome/down-syndrome-facts\" target=\"_new\"> National Down Syndrome Society</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 14, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Obesity in the teen years may increase the risk of developing deadly pancreatic cancer in adulthood, researchers report.</p><p>The odds for this rare cancer can quadruple due to obesity, the Israeli research team found. Moreover, the risk rises as weight increases, even affecting men in the high normal weight range. </p><p>\"It's been known for some time that obesity can increase an individual's risk of developing pancreatic cancer, and [this is] an important new finding suggesting that obesity and overweight in adolescence can also impact risk,\" said Allison Rosenzweig, a senior manager at the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.</p><p>But being overweight or obese doesn't doom you to getting the disease, said Rosenzweig, who had no role in the study.  </p><p>\"Because pancreatic cancer is a relatively rare disease, thought to impact around 55,000 Americans this year, even those at an increased risk have a low likelihood of developing the disease,\" she said.</p><p>Also, because this study looked at retrospective data, it can't prove that excess weight is a cause of pancreatic cancer, only that an association exists.</p><p>Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, with a five-year survival rate below 10 percent, according to the cancer network. </p><p>For the new study, researchers led by Dr. Zohar Levi, of Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva and Tel Aviv University, collected data on more than 1 million Jewish men and 700,000 Jewish women in Israel. Participants had physical examinations at ages 16 to 19 from 1967 to 2002. </p><p>Using the Israeli National Cancer Registry, the researchers identified cases of pancreatic cancer through 2012. Their follow-up revealed 551 new cases of pancreatic cancer. </p><p>Compared with normal weight, obesity was associated with a nearly four times higher risk for cancer among men. Among women, the risk was slightly more than four times higher, the researchers found.</p><p>Overall, the researchers attributed almost 11 percent of the pancreatic cases to teenage overweight and obesity. </p><p>The report was published online Nov. 12 in the journal <i>Cancer</i>. </p><p>Dr. Chanan Meydan, of the Mayanei Hayeshua Medical Center in Israel, wrote an editorial accompanying the study. He said weight gain in adolescence may increase inflammation, which damages cells and might raise cancer risk.</p><p>\"It would be interesting to find whether the inflammatory process in obesity has links to the inflammatory process in malignancy. Are they connected somehow?\" said Meydan. </p><p>The mechanism behind inflammation is \"for the most part, a delicately balanced phenomenon with grave consequences when it's out of balance,\" he said.</p><p>Learning more about how this \"switchboard of control\" works may help scientists better understand the association between obesity and cancer, Meydan added. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Cancer Institute has more about <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/types/pancreatic/patient/pancreatic-treatment-pdq\" target=\"_new\">pancreatic cancer</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Jan. 8, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- A \"low-energy-dense food diet\" sounds like just another weight loss fad, but it's an approach with decades of research behind it.</p><p>The concept is simple: Eat more foods with a higher water content to get more volume for fewer calories.</p><p>Energy density is simply the amount of energy -- or calories -- in a gram of a food. Foods can be very low-, low-, medium- or high-energy density.</p><p>Butter, for instance, is a high-density food with 180 calories in 20 grams. Watermelon is very low, with just 7 calories in 20 grams. Portion size is another way to see the difference. For example, one and a half juicy oranges have the same number of calories as a mere three pretzel rods.</p><p>To find a food's energy density, divide the number of calories in a serving by the number of grams in that serving. Energy density ranges in the very low category are from 0.5 to 1 calorie/gram. As you move to the high end, it's from 4 to 9 calories per gram.</p><p>You can easily calculate the energy density of any food. Use a calorie counter to do the math for fresh foods. For packaged ones, use the Nutrition Facts Panel and divide the calories by the grams in a portion.</p><p>Low-energy density foods are usually high in fiber as well as water, so they're filling. That's one reason why replacing high-energy density foods with low ones to reduce calories is more effective than just cutting portion sizes, which can leave you feeling deprived. Eating low-energy density foods works equally well for weight loss and weight maintenance.</p><p>In recipes, making the switchover can be as simple as adding more non-starchy vegetables in place of starchy ones, and some of the meat. Rather than eating sandwiches, replace the bread with leafy greens by putting the sandwich fillings into a big salad. When eating grains, choose foods like oatmeal and quinoa that increase in volume when cooked in water -- they're a lot more filling than dry cereal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has much more on <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/nutrition/pdf/r2p_energy_density.pdf\" target=\"_new\">the energy density of foods</a> and tips to make substitutions.</p>",

And because rising levels of tau are considered a sign of Alzheimer's, blacks may not meet the same threshold as whites for when Alzheimer's starts.</p><p>\"If we only study Alzheimer's in Caucasians, we'll only learn about Alzheimer's in Caucasians,\" said researcher Dr. John Morris. He is a professor of neurology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.</p><p>\"If we want to understand all the ways the disease can develop in people, we need to include people from all groups. Without a complete understanding of the illness, we're not going to be able to develop therapies that work for all people,\" Morris said. </p><p>For the study, Morris and his colleagues analyzed data from more than 1,200 people, of whom 14 percent (173) were black. The participants averaged 71 years of age. </p><p>Two-thirds of the participants had no signs of memory loss or confusion, and the remaining one-third had very mild or mild Alzheimer's, according to the report.</p><p>All of the study participants underwent a PET scan to detect amyloid plaques in the brain, an MRI scan for signs of brain shrinkage and damage, or a spinal tap to measure levels of proteins in spinal fluid linked to Alzheimer's.</p><p>MRI and PET scans found no significant differences between black patients and white patients, but spinal fluid revealed lower levels of tau among black people, the researchers said.</p><p>Elevated tau has been linked to brain damage, memory loss and confusion, but having lower levels of tau didn't protect black patients from those problems, the investigators found.</p><p>\"With tau, the pattern was the same in African-Americans and whites -- the higher your tau level, the more likely you were cognitively impaired -- but the absolute amounts were consistently lower in African-Americans,\" Morris said.</p><p>This means that assuming tau levels to be the same among different populations may result in an inaccurate diagnosis, he explained.</p><p>The difference in tau was greatest among those with the gene mutation APOE4, which confers a higher risk for Alzheimer's. Earlier studies found that this mutation had a weaker effect in black people.</p><p>The new study findings showed that people who had the lower-risk form of the APOE4 gene had similar levels of tau.</p><p>\"It looks like the APOE4 risk factor doesn't operate the same in African-Americans as it does in whites,\" Morris said in a university news release. </p><p>A more complete understanding of the ways Alzheimer's develops could open up new avenues of research to prevent or treat the disease, the researchers said.</p><p>The report was published Jan. 7 in the journal <i>JAMA Neurology</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on Alzheimer's disease, visit the <a href=\"https://www.alz.org/\" target=\"_new\"> Alzheimer's Association</a>.</p>",

In fact, because even though whole wheat is still processed (though not to the extent as white flour), some of the older, minimally processed grains that have come back into vogue are even better choices.</p><p>Great Grains:</p><ul><li>Amaranth.</li><li>Barley.</li><li>Brown rice.</li><li>Buckwheat (kasha).</li><li>Bulgur.</li><li>Cornmeal (grits, polenta).</li><li>Couscous.</li><li>Farro.</li><li>Millet.</li><li>Oats.</li><li>Quinoa.</li><li>Rye.</li></ul><p>Oatmeal is an obvious choice for breakfast. But try steel-cut oats, which are less refined than rolled oats. Or shake up your morning routine by cooking up grits or buckwheat for your hot cereal.</p><p>Cooked barley, besides being a tasty side dish, can make a hearty addition to your favorite vegetable soup for a satisfying lunch or dinner. Be sure to make enough barley to sprinkle what's left over onto your next salad.</p><p>Build dinner around a serving of polenta or quinoa-pasta topped with sauteed vegetables.</p><p>Vary your favorite recipes simply by making whole grain substitutions. Instead of making a risotto or a pilaf side dish with white rice, try using buckwheat, millet, couscous or polenta as the grain. Whichever one you use will take on the flavors of the other ingredients in the recipe.</p><p>Note that many grains cook in little time, but you might find it handy to make a large batch once or twice a week. The cooked grains will keep for up to 4 days in the fridge to use as you like.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Oldways Whole Grains Council has much more on <a href=\"https://wholegrainscouncil.org/recipes/cooking-whole-grains\" target=\"_new\">whole grains</a>, including cooking times.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 19, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- For  people with diabetes, blood sugar isn't the only important measurement. New  cholesterol guidelines suggest the more than 110 million U.S. adults with  diabetes or prediabetes also should manage their cholesterol. </p><p>The guidelines released earlier this month during the American Heart  Association's Scientific Sessions conference suggest doctors consider  prescribing cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins to people with diabetes who  are age 40 to 75. The guidelines also give a raft of other specific recommendations  for people with diabetes based on age and other risk factors.</p><p>The reality has been scientifically clear for a while, but  many people are not aware of the connection: Middle-age adults with diabetes are usually considered at moderate to high  risk for cardiovascular disease.</p><p>\"It's not new but it's important. If you have diabetes, you  have to work to get your cholesterol under control,\" said Dr. Scott Grundy,  chair of the guidelines writing committee and professor of internal medicine at  the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Veterans Affairs Medical  Center in Dallas. </p><p>Shaun Rivers and Kim Ketter preach much the same thing to  their clients. </p><p>Their company in Petersburg, Virginia, provides diabetes  counseling and educational training. The women, who are twins, believe managing  chronic conditions such as diabetes need a \"holistic approach.\"  </p><p>For them, that means keeping tabs on the bigger picture,  like exercise, blood pressure and cholesterol. </p><p>\"We liken it to a three-legged stool,\" said Ketter, a nurse  practitioner. \"All things are connected, and you have to learn to manage them  all. If you fix one, you might help fix the other ones, and if you fail to  manage one, the stool might fall over.\" </p><p>More than 30 million people in the United States have  diabetes, although one in four doesn't know it, according to Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention statistics. Another 80 million have prediabetes,  a serious health condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but  not high enough yet to be diagnosed as Type 2 diabetes. </p><p>Over the past 20 years, the number of adults diagnosed with  diabetes has more than tripled as the population has aged and become more  overweight or obese.</p><p>There are well-established risk factors for heart disease,  such as smoking, high blood pressure and high blood sugar. There also are what  the new cholesterol guidelines call \"risk-enhancing factors\" such as family  history, chronic kidney disease and metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a  cluster of at least three diagnosed conditions, including high blood pressure,  high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist and abnormal cholesterol  levels.</p><p>Rivers and Ketter use everyday items such as garden hoses to  explain what the waxy-like, fatty buildup of cholesterol can do to the body. </p><p>\"Folks don't understand how it can affect the body overall,\"  Ketter said. \"It's like a garden hose, and you have gunk and stuff inside of it  accumulated over the years. You are going to have to turn up the pressure to  get the same water through that hose. If all that mess is clogging the  arteries, you have to turn up the pressure, and that means your heart is  pumping harder.\" </p><p>While the new cholesterol guidelines suggest doctors talk to  patients with diabetes about risk, lifestyle, and the possible need for  statins, Ketter said she also wants to make sure her patients \"on the cusp\" of  needing medicine are willing to work on good nutrition, exercise and any \"bad  habits.\"</p><p>\"It's going to be a lifestyle change for a lot of them,\"  said Rivers, an advanced diabetes clinical nurse specialist. </p><p>She and her sister should know about that. Although  \"perfectly healthy otherwise,\" the two were diagnosed about a decade ago with  congestive heart failure, possibly from a genetic cause. </p><p>\"In our own personal lives, we deal with (cholesterol),\"  Ketter said. \"Our patients respect us for being honest. Life is a series of  hills and valleys. Sometimes you are in the valley and can't get it right and  sometimes you are on the hill and looking out. Either way, you make corrections  and move on.\"</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 6, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Medical science has made tremendous advances in \"personalized medicine\" -- drugs that fight cancer and other diseases by boosting the immune system or targeting specific genetic traits.</p><p>Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter benefited from one of these drugs, Keytruda (pembrolizumab), which successfully beat back his brain cancer by ramping up his immune system.</p><p>But the American public is still struggling to understand the implications of these new targeted treatments, a new <i>HealthDay/Harris Poll</i> has found.</p><p>A large majority (71 percent) of Americans are unfamiliar with personalized medicine, the survey found.</p><p>Among those who are familiar with the concept, nearly half (49 percent) don't understand that this new type of therapy is typically more successful, with fewer side effects, compared to other treatments.</p> <p>On the other hand, most (62 percent) didn't realize that the cost of the drugs will be significantly higher than other treatments.</p><p>The online survey of over 2,000 adults was conducted Nov. 15-19.</p><p>\"Very few Americans know a lot about personalized medicine but, nevertheless, people are excited about it, particularly regarding its potential to save lives and revolutionize health care,\" said Deana Percassi, managing director of The Harris Poll's public relations research practice.</p><p>Personalized medicine, also called precision medicine, uses genetic profiling and specific knowledge of a person's body to optimize therapies.</p><p>For example, there's a drug called Lynparza (olaparib) that treats people with advanced breast and ovarian cancers caused by mutations of the BRCA gene. The drug blocks an enzyme and makes it more likely for cancerous cells to die off more quickly.</p><p>In an advance for the field, last week the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a drug for a treatment of a wide range of cancers based on a shared mutation. The drug, Vitrakvi (larotrectinib), can treat thyroid, lung, and head and neck cancers caused by a common genetic factor.</p><p><b>Doctors need to spread the word</b></p><p>Despite advances like this, two in five people (41 percent) are not at all familiar with personalized medicine, and only 5 percent said they are very familiar, the survey found.</p><p>That doesn't surprise Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, acting chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society.</p><p>\"We're all exposed to a lot of information on a regular basis,\" Lichtenfeld said. \"People tend to not pay a lot of attention to a particular topic until it becomes personally relevant to them.\"</p><p> Dr. Bruce Johnson suggested that  doctors \"need to do a better job disseminating information about personalized medicine.\" Johnson is past president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. </p><p>\"I'm a lung cancer doc. We just had our fifth drug for a specific genomic driver in lung cancer approved last week. That started out from zero in 2004,\" Johnson said.</p><p>\"As opposed to the old days, where drugs worked, on average, for four to six months, these currently are typically working between 10 months to three years,\" Johnson said. \"For patients with lung cancer, it's dramatically transformed their lives. Our job is to get that information out there and make it clear.\"</p><p><b>More and better treatment options</b></p><p>Lichtenfeld noted that the word needs to spread so people will know these drugs might be available to help them.</p><p>\"I had a conversation with someone a couple of weeks ago who had a cancer, had a genetic test done on their cancer, and had a mutation for which there is a clinical trial, but no one had recognized that,\" Lichtenfeld said.</p><p>\"This was what I call an activated patient, an intelligent and engaged person,\" he continued. \"We need to do a better job, nationwide, understanding the options we now have.\"</p><p>The general public also lacks knowledge of some key topics of debate surrounding personalized medicine.</p><p>More than half (60 percent) are unaware that the drugs used in personalized medicine tend to be much more expensive than more conventional treatments like chemotherapy.</p><p>Overall, 46 percent think the costs of personalized medicine for cancer patients will be similar to other available treatment options.  Even among those who are familiar with personalized medicine, this percentage remains the same.</p><p>Further, about one in six (15 percent) thinks the costs of personalized medicine will be significantly lower than other treatment options.</p><p><b>Cost a big factor</b></p><p>In reality, personalized medicine costs a lot. People taking Keytruda pay around $150,000 a year, while Lynparza is estimated to cost more than $234,000 to extend a patient's life by one year. Vitrakvi will cost $32,800 for a 30-day supply of capsules.</p><p>According to Percassi, \"Even those who are familiar with the topic are relatively unaware of the extreme cost difference between personalized medicine and other available treatments.\"</p><p>There's currently a debate in medicine over the cost of these drugs, Lichtenfeld said.</p><p>On the one hand, these cutting-edge medicines are expensive to develop and often only help a small number of patients who carry the specific genetic trait being targeted, Lichtenfeld explained.</p><p>\"You have people who say it's a big risk to develop these drugs and we take on that risk. As a result of taking on that risk, we're entitled to earn a return on that investment,\" Lichtenfeld said.</p><p>But there are also people who feel these drugs are way too expensive, particularly those for which broader uses have been found, he noted. More patients are taking certain drugs but the prices haven't budged.</p><p>\"When you first had immunotherapy available, you had a very small number of patients who were candidates to receive those drugs,\" Lichtenfeld said. \"Now we're in a situation where thousands of patients can receive those drugs, but the price of the drugs has not come down.\"</p><p>People also don't know that by specifically targeting genes and immune functions within the body, personalized medicine avoids the nasty side effects that result from chemotherapy and other harsh treatments.</p><p>Only around half (48 percent) think personalized medicine will have a higher level of success and relatively less side effects among cancer patients than other available treatments. The percentage still only reaches 51 percent among those who are already familiar with personalized medicine, the poll results showed.</p><p>Johnson pointed out that \"it's not only that it works better, but people can return to their lives, to live as well as they can for as long as they can.\"</p><p><b>Potential to save many lives</b></p><p>Despite this lack of information, the poll found that Americans are excited about the prospects for personalized medicine:</p><ul><li>More than two in three (68 percent) say they are excited about the advances in personalized medicine. The percentage climbs to 85 percent among those who are familiar with personalized medicine.</li><li>More than six in 10 agree personalized medicine will save many lives (63 percent) and revolutionize health care (62 percent). This climbs to three-quarters of those who are familiar with personalized medicine (79 percent say it will save many lives, and 76 percent say it will revolutionize health care).</li><li>Just over two in five (41 percent) say personalized medicine makes them less worried about getting diseases like cancer.</li></ul><p>\"We've been through some ups and downs when it comes to personalized medicine,\" Lichtenfeld said. \"The good news from my perspective is we are clearly on an upswing where we have more medicines that are more effective for particular patients. But we have to keep in mind that for a particular medicine, there may only be a small number of patients who are going to benefit from it.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology has more about <a href=\"https://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/how-cancer-treated/personalized-and-targeted-therapies/what-personalized-cancer-medicine\" target=\"_new\">personalized medicine</a>.</p><p><b>About the <i>HealthDay/Harris Poll</i></b></p><p>The survey was conducted online in the United States by The Harris Poll on behalf of <i>HealthDay</i> between Nov. 15-19, 2018 among 2,016 U.S. adults, aged 18 and older.

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 28, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental gene therapy for Parkinson's disease seems to work by rewiring key areas of the brain, a new study finds.</p><p>The researchers focused on 15 Parkinson's patients who, in an earlier trial, had received so-called GAD gene therapy. GAD is an enzyme that spurs the production of a brain chemical involved in movement control.</p><p>In the previous trial, patients had shown improvements in their movement problems after receiving infusions of the GAD gene into the brain.</p><p>What hadn't been clear was precisely why, said researcher Dr. David Eidelberg, who directs the Center for Neurosciences at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, in Manhasset, N.Y.</p><p>So for the new study, Eidelberg's team examined specialized brain scans from 15 of the trial patients. The investigators found an unexpected answer: The gene therapy did not change the abnormal brain circuitry that marks Parkinson's disease.</p><p>Instead, it essentially rewired a small area of the brain, to partially compensate for the faulty circuitry.</p><p>\"It created its own set of circuits,\" Eidelberg explained. \"The disease circuitry continues -- so this is not a cure.\"</p><p>Still, he said, the gene therapy seems to spur new brain connections that can benefit people with Parkinson's.</p><p>The study findings were published online Nov. 28 in <i>Science Translational Medicine</i>.</p><p>Parkinson's disease affects nearly 1 million people in the United States alone, according to the Parkinson's Foundation.</p><p>The root cause is unclear, but as the disease progresses, the brain loses cells that produce dopamine -- a chemical that regulates movement. As a result, people suffer symptoms like tremors, stiff limbs, and balance and coordination problems that gradually worsen over time.</p><p>There are treatments to lessen those symptoms, including medications that boost dopamine levels or mimic the actions of dopamine. Another option for some patients is deep brain stimulation (DBS), where electrodes are implanted in a specific brain area to deliver continuous electrical pulses. It's thought to help by suppressing abnormal electrical activity.</p><p>GAD gene therapy is done by inserting the gene into an inactivated cold virus. That viral \"vector\" is infused into a specific brain area called the subthalamic nucleus -- which is one of the brain regions targeted in DBS treatment.</p><p>Originally, Eidelberg added, researchers thought the gene therapy would work in a \"DBS-like\" way.</p><p>But based on the new findings, that's not the case.</p><p>Dr. Michael Okun is medical director of the Parkinson's Foundation. He called the study \"fascinating.\"</p><p>\"It showed that GAD gene therapy, unlike subthalamic nucleus DBS, did not change the expected Parkinson's disease brain network,\" Okun said. \"Instead, it co-opted adjacent non-motor pathways.\"</p><p>Why does that matter? One reason, according to Okun, is that it offers an \"important lesson\" for the gene therapy field going forward.</p><p>Researchers cannot make assumptions about a therapy's \"mechanism of action,\" he said, based on the brain area it targets.</p><p>Eidelberg made another point: In future studies, researchers could use brain imaging to be sure that patients' symptom improvements are due to a true effect of the gene therapy -- rather than a \"placebo effect.\"</p><p>In the original trial, which involved a few dozen Parkinson's patients, some were randomly assigned to receive GAD gene infusions. The rest underwent a \"sham\" procedure for comparison.</p><p>Over six months, both groups showed improvements in movement symptoms like stiffness and tremor. But the gene therapy group saw greater gains.</p><p>\"It wasn't a slam dunk,\" Eidelberg stressed. \"But they were doing better. And that persisted to the one-year mark.\"</p><p>With any such therapy, there is a theoretical concern that the infused gene will have unintended effects.</p><p>\"What we've seen is that this gene stays put,\" Eidelberg said. \"It doesn't percolate all over the brain.\"</p><p>In the original trial, there were no red flags, according to the researchers. The most common side effects were temporary headaches and nausea.</p><p>Various research teams are looking at different approaches to gene therapy for Parkinson's. The hope, Eidelberg said, is to develop additional options that work for at least some patients -- possibly freeing them from taking daily medications.</p><p>At this point, he noted, there is \"a lot of interest\" in doing a larger, later-stage trial of the GAD therapy. But none has begun yet.</p><p>The current study was funded by Neurologix Inc., the company that developed the gene therapy.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Parkinson's Foundation has more on <a href=\"http://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/treatment\" target=\"_new\">Parkinson's treatment</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Dec. 7, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Nine more people have been sickened by E. coli in an outbreak involving romaine lettuce grown in parts of California, bringing the total to 52 people in 15 states, U.S. health officials reported Thursday.</p><p>Nineteen people have been hospitalized, including two who developed a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome. No deaths have been reported, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.</p><p>For lettuce lovers, the advice from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration remains the same: Be sure to check the label on any romaine lettuce, to avoid the risk of E. coli.</p><p>Romaine lettuce sold in stores now carries labels listing the region where the produce was grown, along with its harvest date, the FDA said. By checking these labels, consumers can quickly determine that the produce is safe to eat.</p><p>\"Romaine lettuce that was harvested outside of the Central Coast growing regions of northern and central California does not appear to be related to the current outbreak,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said recently.</p><p>That would include romaine farmed in Arizona, Florida and Mexico, as well as California's Imperial Valley -- lettuce harvested from these areas is OK to eat.</p><p>\"Hydroponically- and greenhouse-grown romaine also does not appear to be related to the current outbreak,\" Gottlieb added. \"There is no recommendation for consumers or retailers to avoid using romaine harvested from these sources.\"</p><p>Information from four restaurants in three different states so far has implicated 10 different distributors, 12 different growers and 11 different farms as potential sources of tainted lettuce, the FDA said Thursday. At this point, the outbreak cannot be explained by a single farm, grower, harvester or distributor, the agency noted.</p><p>If heads of romaine are sold loose, without affixed labels, retailers are being asked to post a notice showing place and date of harvest near the store register.</p><p>Such labeling may become standard going forward, according to an agreement between the FDA and the leafy greens industry, the agency has said.</p><p>In addition, at least 27 cases of E. coli have been reported in Canada.</p><p>\"Through laboratory studies we have identified that the E. coli O157:H7 strain causing the outbreak is similar to one that produced an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the fall of 2017 that also occurred in the U.S. and Canada, which was associated with consumption of leafy greens in the U.S. and specifically romaine lettuce in Canada,\" Gottlieb said.</p><p>So who's most at risk from E. coli?</p><p>Dr. Robert Glatter is an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City who's seen the effects of infection with the gastrointestinal bug firsthand. It's not a minor ailment, he said.</p><p>\"In general, symptoms of E. coli infection generally begin about three to four days after consuming the bacteria, and may include abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and watery or bloody diarrhea, along with fever,\" Glatter said.</p><p>And while healthy people who battle a bout of E. coli typically recover within five to seven days, the illness can be more protracted -- and even deadly -- for people already made vulnerable by chronic disease or advanced age.</p><p>\"People with diabetes, kidney disease or those with cancer or autoimmune disease run the risk of a more severe illness,\" Glatter explained.</p><p>The particular strain of E. coli detected in the current lettuce outbreak -- E. coli O157:H7 -- is particularly nasty, he noted.</p><p>\"Most strains of E. coli do not actually cause diarrhea, but E. coli O157 produces a powerful toxin that injures the inner lining of the small intestine, leading to bloody diarrhea,\" Glatter said. Even a tiny amount of ingested bacteria could spur this type of illness.</p><p>\"It can make people much more ill, and may lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure, in some cases,\" he said.</p><p>Indeed, the CDC has reported one such case already in the latest outbreak.</p><p>In many cases, antibiotics are used to help beat back an E. coli infection, but these drugs can affect the kidneys, Glatter noted.</p><p>\"Antibiotics may be necessary in certain cases, so it's important to see your doctor if you have continued and severe symptoms such as fever, bloody diarrhea, and you are not able to eat or drink,\" he said.</p><p>However, in the case of E. coli O157:H7, \"taking antibiotics may actually increase your risk of developing kidney failure, so it's important to speak with your health care provider if you should develop severe symptoms,\" Glatter advised.</p><p>And if you do think you might be sick with E. coli, or any other foodborne illness, make sure you don't spread it to those near you.</p><p>The bacterium \"can be transmitted person-to-person, so it's vital that anyone who is potentially infected wash their hands thoroughly and not share utensils, cups or glasses,\" Glatter said. \"This also goes for bath towels. Linens also need to be washed in hot water and treated with bleach.\"</p><p>He noted that \"ground beef, unpasteurized milk, fresh produce and contaminated water are common sources of E. coli bacteria.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Find out more about E. coli illness at the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/ecoli-symptoms.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Dec. 10, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Infants born addicted to opioids may be more likely to have smaller heads that might hinder their development, new research suggests.</p><p>\"Babies chronically exposed to opiates [during pregnancy] had a head size about a centimeter smaller\" than babies born to moms not using drugs, said lead researcher Dr. Craig Towers. He's an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology with the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville.</p><p>These infants had three times higher odds of a head size that fell within the lowest 10 percent of all babies in the study, results showed.</p><p>Prior research has shown that infants born with smaller heads typically have a higher rate of mental health and developmental problems, Towers said.</p><p>The findings call into question treatment standards for pregnant women addicted to heroin or other opioids.</p><p>Addicted women are now placed onto drug maintenance therapy and given methadone or buprenorphine throughout their pregnancy to replace the street drugs they've been taking, Towers said.</p><p>Medical societies such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recommended this approach because weaning a pregnant woman off narcotics could cause her to relapse and overdose, harming or killing herself and the fetus.</p><p>\"What we're recommending these moms do, which is get on methadone and buprenorphine, may result in a smaller head size of the baby,\" Towers said. \"This is going to have to make us re-look at what we're doing.\"</p><p>Previous studies already have indicated that babies born addicted to opioids -- a condition called neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) -- might be born with smaller heads due to their drug exposure, Towers said.</p><p>But those studies struggled to separate the effect of opioids from the potential role of other exposures the fetus might have endured. These expecting moms often also drink, smoke and take prescribed and illicit substances, Towers said.</p><p>To nail this down, Towers and his colleagues followed 858 babies from gestation to birth and beyond. About half of the infants were born with NAS. All of the pregnancies were managed at the University of Tennessee Medical Center.</p><p>All the mothers underwent regular drug screens while pregnant, so researchers could take into account the drug exposures from the addicted moms and also could make sure moms in the control group remained drug-negative, Towers said.</p><p>Infants born addicted to opioids had significantly smaller head circumferences, researchers found. In fact, NAS was the only variable significantly linked to smaller head size.</p><p>More than 30 percent of babies born with NAS had a head size that ranked among the smallest in the study, compared with about 12 percent of infants in the control group.</p><p>No one knows for sure why opioid exposure in the womb is linked to smaller head size, but it could be because these drugs work on many neural receptors in the brain, Towers said, and they could alter the way the fetal brain develops.</p><p>Women addicted to street drugs definitely need to be put into rehab, Towers said.</p><p>\"I don't want anyone to think putting them on methadone or buprenorphine is not the way to go. If they continue to use street drugs, that's exponentially worse,\" Towers said. </p><p>\"The street drugs aren't pure, the supply is inconsistent. They don't know how much they're taking. Some patients will think they're taking oxycodone and they're taking oxymophone [another opioid painkiller], which is five times stronger,\" he said.</p><p>These results show that those women and their doctors face a heavy decision after they've stopped taking street opioids, Towers said.</p><p>\"There are risks to the mom if she tapers and detoxes, but there are risks to the baby if she stays on maintenance therapy,\" Towers said. \"There needs to be informed consent so the mother can choose how she wants to go.\"</p><p>The findings were published online Dec. 10 in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i>.</p><p>The new study is going to be \"very controversially received,\" said Dr. Mark Hudak, lead author of an editorial accompanying the study.</p><p>\"I think there's going to be pushback on it, but one has to follow the evidence,\" said Hudak, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Florida College of Medicine.</p><p>\"The whole pillar of opioid maintenance therapy is based upon the fact this is better for the mother and the baby in the sense that the mother is in therapy, she is more closely monitored, she's more likely to access good prenatal care, she's less likely to engage in behaviors that would be harmful to her or the fetus,\" Hudak said.</p><p>There's also \"a correct sense that those women if they undergo detox they're at risk for relapse, which would be harmful to themselves and the fetus. There's no question about that,\" Hudak said.</p><p>But if a mother is highly motivated to get off drugs, doctors will have to weigh these findings in their discussions with her regarding detoxification versus drug maintenance, he said.</p><p>\"You now have to ask, is that the only or the best way for all women,\" Hudak said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has more about <a href=\" https://www.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Obstetric-Practice/Opioid-Use-and-Opioid-Use-Disorder-in-Pregnancy?IsMobileSet=false \" target=\"_new\">opioid use in pregnancy</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 20, 2018 (American  Heart Association) -- Katie and Lance Cox were watching TV one evening, their  infant twins Carter and John asleep nearby, when Katie dropped the remote  control. As it clattered across the floor, the couple froze, staring terrified  at one another.</p><p>They weren't worried about the remote.  They were concerned that the noise would startle their babies to death.</p><p>That's what life is like when  doctors say your newborns have only a 50 percent chance of surviving to their  first birthday.</p><p>Carter and John were each born with  a heart defect called long QT syndrome that can cause the heart to go into an  irregular rhythm and could even lead to sudden cardiac arrest.</p><p>\"So, we've got to keep things calm  and quiet around the house,\" Katie said.</p><p>That means no playing peek-a-boo, Katie  and Lance turning their phones to silent and telling friends and family not to  ring the doorbell at their home in Heber Springs, Arkansas.</p><p>They also put box fans in their  rooms as white noise to mask any loud, sudden noises.</p><p>The term &quot;long QT&quot; refers  to an abnormal pattern seen on an&nbsp;electrocardiogram, a test that detects  and records the heart's electrical activity. With each heartbeat, an electrical  signal spreads from the top of the heart to the bottom. As it travels, the  signal causes the heart to contract and pump blood. An EKG records electrical  signals as they move through the heart. Data from the EKG are mapped on a graph,  and each heartbeat is mapped as five distinct electrical waves: P, Q, R, S and  T.</p><p>The day after Carter was born, her heart  rate dropped precipitously, so the doctors gave her an EKG. The results led to her  diagnosis of long QT syndrome. Because the condition is often hereditary, they also  gave John an EKG. He had the condition, too.</p><p>\"The doctor told us, 'Take them  home and love them as best you can. And do everything you can to keep them  alive,'\" Katie said.</p><p>The twins were in the hospital for  10 days, but before they were discharged, everyone in their extended family had  to learn CPR.</p><p>Now 3, they still don't go anywhere  without their own AED, or automated external defibrillator, that could jump-start  a stopped or irregularly beating heart. Katie carries two  one for each child.</p><p>Katie said she was so on edge during  those first weeks that she spent most of the night staring at the baby monitor,  listening to make sure they were still breathing.</p><p>\"You have to stop,\" Lance told her.  \"If something's going to happen, it will happen. God has a plan for them.\"</p><p>The twins are now happy and  relatively healthy. They love riding their sister Halle's rodeo horse Gunner,  who is especially gentle.</p><p>They take a beta blocker to help  shorten the QT interval and potassium supplements to keep it from getting  longer.</p><p>Although the twins are thriving, they're  still medically fragile, said Dr. Srikant Das, their pediatric cardiac  electrophysiologist at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock.</p><p>\"They came through their first year  unscathed and haven't had any major problems since then,\" he said. \"But they'll  never be completely out of danger and it's likely they'll be on medications  their whole lives.\"</p><p>That's why Lance and Katie hope  research may someday lead to even better treatments for long QT syndrome.</p>",

She's a clinical research psychologist at the University of California, San Francisco. </p><p>\"Traditionally, menopause symptoms have been largely attributed to biological and hormonal changes,\" as well as negative mood, smoking and chronic health conditions such as obesity, Gibson explained in a university news release. </p><p>Now it seems that stress caused by emotional abuse or other trauma may play a role in hormonal changes that affect menopause, the study authors noted. </p><p>Among more than 2,000 middle-aged and older women, the researchers found that one in five had been emotionally abused by a former or current partner. These women had 50 percent higher odds of night sweats and 60 percent higher odds of painful sex, according to the study.</p><p>Moreover, menopausal pain and discomfort were also significantly higher in women who had symptoms of PTSD or were victims of sexual assault or domestic violence, the findings showed.</p><p>Women with PTSD had more than three times the risk of sleep difficulties, and more than twice the odds of vaginal irritation and painful intercourse. And victims of sexual assault or violence by a former or current partner were 40 to 44 percent more likely to experience painful sex, the researchers reported.</p><p>Traumatic exposures, especially emotional abuse and PTSD, were \"surprisingly common\" in this sample of women, Gibson said. </p><p>Emotional abuse included being made fun of, severely criticized, called stupid or worthless, or threats of harm either to the woman herself, her possessions or her pets.</p><p>Among the study group, about 23 percent reported symptoms of PTSD, 16 percent said they were or had been victims of domestic violence, and 19 percent had experienced sexual assault.</p><p>The study can't prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship. Still, the findings suggest that \"routine assessment and recognition of PTSD symptoms and lifetime traumatic exposures when women are seen by health care providers may enhance the effective management of menopausal symptoms,\" Gibson concluded. </p><p>The report was published Nov. 19 in <i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on menopause, visit the <a href=\"https://www.womenshealth.gov/menopause\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 20, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- For Americans with diabetes, high-deductible health insurance plans may lead to delays in diagnosing and treating dangerous blood vessel diseases, a new study suggests. </p><p>\"People with diabetes in high-deductible health insurance plans compared to people with diabetes without high-deductible health insurance had delays in care for macrovascular complications of a month to three months,\" said the study's lead author, Dr. Frank Wharam. He's director of the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute's division of health policy and insurance research. </p><p>Macrovascular complications are problems related to large blood vessels, such as those leading to the heart and brain. These include heart disease, stroke and peripheral artery disease -- a condition that affects blood supply to your limbs. </p><p>People with diabetes have a greater risk of macrovascular complications, and 70 percent of deaths in people with diabetes are linked to these complications, the Harvard study authors said. </p><p>A high-deductible health insurance plan has a deductible of $1,000 or more per year, according to the study. That means someone must pay at least $1,000 of their health care costs before their insurance starts paying for any health care expenses. The researchers said that some plans have deductibles as high as $7,000 per person, per year. </p><p>Nearly half of Americans insured in employer-provided health care are enrolled in high-deductible health insurance plans, according to a new report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p><p>And those high-deductible costs may keep people from seeking care, at least for a little while, the study found. </p><p>To see what effect deductibles had on care for those blood vessel diseases, the researchers reviewed data for up to four years on nearly 34,000 people with diabetes who previously had low-deductible ($500 or less a year) insurance and then had high-deductible insurance ($1,000 or more a year). The researchers compared them to a group of almost 300,000 people with diabetes who had low-deductible health insurance throughout the study period. </p><p>When the study began and both groups had low-deductible health insurance, the researchers saw no difference in how quickly patients received care for symptoms, diagnosis or treatment of macrovascular complications. </p><p>When members of the smaller group transitioned to the high-deductible insurance care, they delayed going to the doctor for their first symptom of macrovascular disease by 1.5 months. They waited almost two months for their first diagnostic test and just over three months for their first procedure-based treatment. </p><p>Wharam said his previous research has shown that a delay for certain problems could lead to serious complications. \"If you have a skin infection and go to the doctor on day one, you could be walking out with a bottle of pills to treat the infection. If you wait till day seven, you could end up hospitalized,\" he explained. </p><p>Dr. Joel Zonszein, director of the Clinical Diabetes Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, said the study highlights shortcomings in insurance coverage in the United States.</p><p>\"This study shows once more the problems we have in our health system. Deductibles are another barrier to treating diabetes and cardiovascular disease,\" said Zonszein, who wasn't involved with the study.</p><p>\"Patients are benefitting less and less from insurance, and we continue to treat the complications of diabetes instead of paying for prevention,\" he said. </p><p>Wharam said if your employer offers you a choice, or you have options on your state's health care exchange, look closely at what your costs for each plan will be. He noted that people with diabetes often have a lot of health care costs. So it might make more sense to pay a higher monthly premium to lower your out-of-pocket costs from deductibles and copays. But it depends on your particular situation. </p><p>He also suggested seeing if your employer offers a health savings plan. These can help spread the cost of health care throughout the year. </p><p>Whatever your health care situation, Wharam said if you need care, you should get it. \"If you have diabetes, our study shows there's a delay in care. It might be conscious or subconscious, but there's a delay. Patients should seek care [without regard to] the cost,\" he said. </p><p>Results of the study were published in the Nov. 20 issue of <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases has more about <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/financial-help-diabetes-care\" target=\"_new\">paying for diabetes care</a>.</p>",

One person in California has died and 63 people have been hospitalized, the CDC reported.</p><p>So far, investigators have been unable to pinpoint a particular source of the salmonella-contaminated raw turkey, and \"it might be widespread in the turkey industry,\" the CDC noted.</p><p>That's all a bit scary, and of course the best way to avoid getting ill is to avoid the recalled brands (see link below).</p><p>But one emergency department physician who sees lots of cases of severe food poisoning says cooks can take steps to eliminate the risk.</p><p>First, \"salmonella can be spread from one person to another, so it's vital to wash your hands before and after preparing or eating food,\" said Dr. Robert Glatter, who practices at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>\"Always remember to thoroughly wash hands, cutting boards, countertops, and utensils with warm, soapy water after they are in contact with raw turkey,\" he added. \"It's best to use a separate cutting board for raw turkey and any other raw meats, to prevent cross-contamination.\"</p><p>When thawing your Thanksgiving bird, do it in the refrigerator, the microwave, or in a sink where cold water is changed every half-hour, Glatter said. \"Do not thaw your turkey by leaving it out on the counter, since this can be a quick way to spread bacteria such as salmonella,\" he said.</p><p>During the cooking process, \"it's important to cook raw turkey thoroughly to kill harmful bacteria such as salmonella,\" Glatter explained. \"Whole turkeys, ground poultry, turkey breasts, and turkey burgers should always be cooked to an internal temperature of 165-degrees Fahrenheit to kill harmful bacteria.\"</p><p>That temperature guide holds true for reheated leftover turkey, too, he said. To be certain, use a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the turkey.</p><p>\"It's important to refrigerate all leftovers at 40-degrees F or colder immediately, but also within two hours of preparation to reduce the risk of food poisoning,\" Glatter said.</p><p>Besides salmonella, another important bacteria to be aware of that may cause food poisoning is <i>Clostridium perfringens</i>, he said.</p><p>\"These bacteria can flourish in cooked foods that are left out at room temperature, and are the second most common bacterial cause of food poisoning. People can develop abdominal cramps along with nausea and vomiting six to 24 hours after eating,\" Glatter noted. </p><p>\"Outbreaks of <i>Clostridium perfringens</i> occur most commonly during the winter months, especially November and December,\" he said, and \"have been associated with foods often prepared during the holidays such as turkey, as well as roasts and other slowly cooked red meats.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For a complete list of the recalled Jennie-O Turkey products, head <a href=\"https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/recall-case-archive/archive/2018/recall-112-2018-release\" target=\"_new\">here</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 21, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- When you first start strength training, almost any weight you lift will bring some results.</p><p>But also use this time to learn proper form, the American College of Sports Medicine advises. As you progress, you can zero in on the best amount of weight as well as the number of repetitions and sets of repetitions you do.</p><p>A general starting guideline for beginners is to choose a weight that you can lift for one set of 12 to 15 repetitions. Note that one repetition or \"rep\" has three parts: lengthening the muscle (the lift), a momentary pause (the contraction) and shortening the muscle (the return to starting position). Then, over the course of a few weeks, build up to two and then three sets, at which point you'll add weight and repeat the process.</p><p>To progress effectively, the American Council on Exercise says to aim for muscle fatigue, which is actually more important than the overall number of reps you do. Muscle fatigue occurs when the muscle being worked is no longer capable of performing any more reps. This is the sign that all the muscle fibers of that muscle have been engaged.</p><p>Lifting heavier weights will lead to muscle fatigue with fewer reps than lower weights, which brings us to the next point: Choosing whether you're training for strength or for muscle definition.</p><p>If you're training for strength, use weights that cause fatigue after a maximum of six repetitions. If you're training for definition, do a higher number of reps with a lower weight and at a slower pace -- you want to hold the contraction phase longer. You still want to achieve muscle fatigue, which in this case will typically occur between eight and 15 reps.</p><p>And always be sure to rest between sets. The heavier the weight you lift, the longer the resting period should be. Figure on one or two minutes of rest with a lighter weight, two or three minutes with a moderate weight, and three or more minutes with a heavy weight.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Council on Exercise has more tips on <a href=\"http://www.acefitness.org/acefit/healthy-living-article/60/5867/how-many-reps-should-you-be-doing\" target=\"_new\">how many reps you should do</a> during your weight workouts to help you reach your goals.</p>",

She is a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.</p><p>Yuan cautioned that this study cannot prove these nutrient-laden dietary choices reduce memory loss, only that they're related. Also, the results may not apply to women or men outside the health professions.</p><p>For the study, which was partly funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the researchers collected data on nearly 28,000 male health professionals, average age 51. </p><p>Participants completed questionnaires about how many servings of fruits, vegetables and other foods they ate daily at the study's start and every four years thereafter for 20 years. </p><p>Fruits and vegetables contain high levels of antioxidant nutrients, the researchers noted.</p><p>A fruit serving is defined as one cup of fruit or one-half cup of fruit juice. A serving of vegetables is one cup of raw vegetables or two cups of leafy greens.</p><p>The participants were asked about their thinking and memory skills at least four years before the end of the study, at age 73 on average.</p><p>Questions included, \"Do you have more trouble than usual remembering a short list of items, such as a shopping list?\" and \"Do you have more trouble than usual following a  TV program due to your memory?\"</p><p>Changes in memory were considered early signs of mild cognitive impairment. </p><p>Overall, 55 percent said that they still had good thinking and memory skills, 38 percent had moderate skills, and 7 percent had poor thinking and memory skills, the findings showed.</p><p>How great was the protective effect? Men who ate the most vegetables -- about six servings a day -- were 34 percent less likely to develop poor thinking skills than those who ate the least -- just two servings. </p><p>Moreover, daily orange juice drinkers were 47 percent less likely to develop poor thinking skills, compared with men who drank less than one serving a month, the researchers found. This association was seen mostly among the oldest men.</p><p>The study showed that less than 7 percent of frequent veggie eaters developed poor memory function, compared with 8 percent of men who avoided their fruits and greens. The results were similar among frequent and infrequent orange juice drinkers.</p><p>Since fruit juice is usually high in calories, it's generally best to drink a small glass, 4 to 6 ounces, a day, Yuan said.  \"Even better is choosing the whole piece of fruit instead, which contains the added benefit of fiber,\" she suggested.</p><p>Although men who ate the most fruit were also less likely to develop memory problems over time, that association weakened when the researchers accounted for consumption of vegetables, fruit juice, refined grains, legumes and dairy products. </p><p>Long-term habits also appeared to play a role. Those who ate lots of fruits and veggies 20 years before the memory test were less likely to develop thinking and memory problems, whether or not they did so in the six years before the memory test.</p><p>Rebecca Edelmayer is director of scientific engagement at the Alzheimer's Association. She noted that, because this study relies on participants' recall, it is not as rigorous as other studies.</p><p>Still, it makes a valid point that preserving mental health is, to some degree, a matter of lifestyle, just like preventing heart disease, she added. </p><p>\"This is a hot topic of research right now,\" Edelmayer said. </p><p>A healthy diet plus exercise and mental stimulation might reduce your risk for mental decline, she said. \"We see a future where Alzheimer's disease will be treated with a medication, but also life intervention -- like we do with heart disease,\" Edelmayer said. </p><p>The report was published online Nov. 21 in <i>Neurology</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more on keeping your brain healthy, visit the <a href=\"https://www.alz.org/help-support/brain_health/10_ways_to_love_your_brain\" target=\"_new\"> Alzheimer's Association</a>.</p>",

It also helps to have a network of support from family and friends.</p><p>Yet even couples who face a difficult transition and experience more disruption in their lives when they have a second child still return to their \"pre-baby normal\" by the fourth post-partum month, studies show.</p><p>Having navigated parenthood for the first time can give you the confidence you need to add to your family. And some advance planning for how you'll manage after your second baby comes will ease the way to growing into a family of four.</p><p>Keep in mind that finding ways to handle the logistics of a new baby and helping your first child adjust to the new member of the family will also help ease the stress that both you and your spouse may feel during this time.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Nemours Foundation has more advice for <a href=\"https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/second-child.html\" target=\"_new\">parenting a second child</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>SUNDAY, Nov. 25, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- People caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's or other types of dementia should focus on four main safety issues, an expert says.</p><p>Nearly 6 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, according to the Alzheimer's Association. About 16.1 million Americans provide unpaid care for people with Alzheimer's or other dementias.</p><p>\"When approaching dementia families, I follow the safe and sane rule,\" said Dr. Andrew Duxbury, a geriatrician in the Division of Gerontology, Geriatrics and Palliative Care at University of Alabama at Birmingham.</p><p>\"Everything we do needs to make the patient safe and the family sane. In terms of safety, it boils down into the big four: meals, wheels, bills and pills,\" he explained in a university news release.</p><p>In terms of meals, caregivers need to consider whether the person is capable of preparing food, eating healthy and appropriate amounts of food, and has the awareness that they need to eat, Duxbury said. \"If any link in that chain breaks, the person may not eat,\" he said.</p><p>When it comes to kitchen safety, the \"biggest issue is leaving things on the stove and forgetting to turn the oven off; but if cooking is part of someone's routine, let them cook on their own while monitoring what they are doing from another room,\" he said.</p><p>\"Think about it this way: Would you let your 12-year-old make dinner? You may, but you would definitely be in the next room listening for anything that could go wrong,\" Duxbury said.</p><p>Other suggestions include planning meals that require minimal preparation or can be made in the microwave; removing scissors and knives from the countertop and drawers; putting labels on kitchen cabinets; and disguising the garbage disposal switch to prevent someone from turning it on accidentally.</p><p>It's not safe for patients with late-stage dementia to prepare food on the stove or in the oven, Duxbury said.</p><p>When it comes to getting out of the house, the loss of independence caused by having to give up driving can be difficult for dementia patients.</p><p>\"A lot of times, an older man may just want to have the car keys, feel them in his pocket and see the car in the driveway,\" Duxbury said. \"You can let him have the keys, just not the key to the actual car. Give him the keys to a different car or remove the car key from his set of keys. This way, he has the keys, hears them jingle in his pocket and sees his car, but can't go anywhere.\"</p><p>If a person can no longer drive, caregivers need to ensure there is another source of transportation, especially for medical appointments. Arrange to have medications, groceries or meals delivered.</p><p>Evaluate and monitor the person's finances to make sure he or she has  enough money to pay bills and is not being taken advantage of or scammed, Duxbury advised.</p><p>Many seniors take multiple medications. Those with dementia often forget to take their pills or take pills together that can cause harmful side effects. Caregivers need to ensure their loved one is correctly managing their medications and going to medical appointments. It's also important to keep an eye on the person's other health issues.</p><p>To help your loved one, set up a pillbox with a week's worth of pills, sorted by day. Some pillboxes have timers and locks you can set to prevent him or her from taking the wrong day's dose.</p> <p>Duxbury said most people with dementia think they're fine. </p><p>\"Families need to remember that a person with dementia does not live in the same reality that we live in,\" he said. \"They live in a reality of their brain's dementia. These individuals may have completely different perceptions of the world around them and what it means. &hellip; We have to accept their reality for what it is.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Aging has more about <a href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers/caregiving\" target=\"_new\">Alzheimer's caregiving</a>.</p>",

As such, the Asian longhorned tick is considered \"a new and emerging disease threat,\" according to a team led by C. Ben Beard, of the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases.</p><p>Ticks are already the bane of Americans everywhere, with bites being prime causes of severe illness such as Lyme disease, babesiosis, Powassan encephalitis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and other infections.</p> <p>Now the newly introduced species brings the specter of another very serious illness, called \"severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus\" (SFTSV). This tick-borne disease quickly brings on serious hemorrhagic fever. It first emerged in China but has since been spotted in South Korea and Japan.</p><p>As described by Chinese researchers in a 2011 issue of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>, symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea and anemia. In some cases multiple organ failure can result, and 12 percent of cases prove fatal.</p><p>The tick can also spread a virus known to cause Japanese spotted fever in humans, another potentially fatal illness that brings very high fever and red rash.  The CDC believes the insect can also be a vector for numerous other ailments, including Powassan virus.</p><p>Beard's team stressed that, so far, no such cases of SFTSV or Japanese spotted fever linked to the Asian longhorned tick have been reported in the United States.</p><p>Importation of the ticks has long been a worry for U.S. health officials.</p><p> \"Before 2017, <i>H. longicornis</i> ticks were intercepted at U.S. ports of entry at least 15 times on imported animals and materials,\" which were then quarantined, Beard's team noted.</p><p>The first report of the tick being found in a <i>non</i>-quarantined animal in the United States involved a sheep in New Jersey in 2017, the new CDC report said. Since then, 53 more cases have emerged including 23 from domestic animals, 13 from wildlife, and two from humans. Fifteen more samples of the tick were found from environmental sampling -- tick traps, for example -- in grass or other vegetation.</p><p>Right now the tick seems localized to Eastern states, but its range could spread.</p><p>Steps are already being put into place to try to identify and limit the tick's spread, Beard's group noted. </p><p>\"Many state and federal agencies are developing and disseminating information for stakeholders, including development of hotlines, and some states are identifying ticks submitted by the public,\" the team reported.</p><p>The new report was published in the Nov. 30 issue of the CDC's <i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The CDC has more on the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/longhorned-tick/index.html\" target=\"_new\"> Asian longhorned tick</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Nov. 26, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- High-impact hits may affect the brain development of children and teens after just one season of football, preliminary research suggests. </p><p>The study compared functional MRI scans taken pre- and post-season. The researchers saw more gray matter volume in those who had high-impact hits  -- but no concussions -- over the season. </p><p>More gray matter indicates that the brain might not be working as well as it could be. </p><p>The brain contains an abundance of connections between nerve cells (synapses) that are constantly changing. New connections are made, while unused ones are pruned away. The process can be compared to tree trimming -- if you prune dead branches off a tree, it allows for healthy growth. The pruning that occurs in the brain also allows for healthy growth, the researchers said. </p><p>\"The brain becomes more efficient after gray matter pruning,\" explained study author Gowtham Krishnan Murugesan. </p><p>The study included 60 youth and high school football players aged 9 to 18, said Murugesan, a research assistant in the radiology department at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. None had had a concussion or any known developmental, neurological or psychiatric disorders. </p><p>The players' high-tech helmets were outfitted with accelerometers -- sensors that measure the severity, location and direction of impacts to the head. </p><p>The researchers used information from the sensors to divide the group into high or low impact players. Twenty-four players were considered  high-impact players, and 36 were low-impact. </p><p>In addition to looking at gray matter volume, the researchers also studied an area of the brain called the default mode network (DMN). This is a network of regions deep within the brain's gray matter. \"The DMN network is important for planning and controlling social behaviors,\" Murugesan said. </p><p>The researchers saw a significant increase in power in this area for the high-impact group. Murugesan said that if gray matter pruning is happening as it should, the power should be reduced because the brain would be working more efficiently. </p><p>It isn't yet clear if the effects on gray matter are temporary. Murugesan said that after not playing for nine months (off-season), the players' brains may go back to what they were at the start of the season. </p><p>Dr. Bruce Silverman is a neurologist at Ascension Providence Hospital in Southfield, Mich. \"In people who've had repeated head traumas -- measured by accelerometers -- brain pruning is not as effective,\" said Silverman, who wasn't involved in the study. </p><p>This study showed it doesn't necessarily take major knockouts or concussions to cause changes in the brain, he noted.  </p><p>However, neither expert said it's time for kids to hang up their football gear. Any potential long-term effects aren't yet known. </p><p>In the meantime, Murugesan and his co-authors hope to make play safer. The data from the helmets suggested that a lot of the high-impact hits occurred during practice. </p><p>\"Many players are getting more impact during practice,\" Murugesan said. One way to make play safer, he added, might be to replace some high-impact practice drills with low-impact ones. </p><p>Silverman agreed. \"Practice could be a greater time of trauma than the game itself. In practice, players get pushed harder to be tougher for the game. The physical nature of practice may need to be toned down a bit,\" he said. </p><p>Also, part of the problem may be that players are faster now, he added. </p><p>\"We've been making pads less encumbering,\" Silverman said. \"In the past, you had something that slowed you down and didn't allow you to run as fast as the new equipment does.\" </p><p>Silverman said parents should make sure that young football players are well-equipped with helmets and pads. The coaching staff should be trained to monitor and evaluate kids after any type of head injury, and not put kids back into play too soon, he noted. </p><p>The study was scheduled for presentation Monday at the Radiological Society of North America meeting, in Chicago. Findings presented at meetings are typically viewed as preliminary until they're published in a peer-reviewed journal. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about head injuries in sports from the <a href=\"https://www.aans.org/Patients/Neurosurgical-Conditions-and-Treatments/Sports-related-Head-Injury\" target=\"_new\">American Association of Neurological Surgeons</a>.</p>",

To have a happy and healthy holiday season, we should all take a few moments to pause, and be mindful of what our body and mind are telling us,\" he added in a hospital news release.</p><p>It's important to set realistic expectations and goals. Say no to social activities, chores and events when you need to, and be sure your priority is on you, your family and your health.</p><p>Holiday parties and shopping can expose you to illness-causing germs. Carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with you or wash your hands frequently with warm water and soap.</p><p>Be sure to drink plenty of water. Dehydration can increase levels of the stress hormone cortisol,  leading to feelings of anxiety, exhaustion and irritability, according to Cooke.</p><p>Be active. Try to get at least 30 minutes of outdoor activity every day. For example, go for a run, take a walk with your family, or go ice skating.</p><p>It's OK to indulge in some holiday treats, but try to maintain a healthy diet most of the time. For snacks, focus on nutritious items like fresh fruits and vegetables, Cooke said.</p><p>Find time to rest and relax to reduce stress and keep your immune system strong. Have an herbal tea, meditate or read a book to wind down. And try to get eight hours of sleep each night.</p><p>Tell family and friends that you're grateful for having them in your life. Expressing gratitude can improve positive feelings, fight depression and strengthen relationships, Cooke said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/family/holiday/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">holiday health and safety tips</a>.</p>",

But less severe infections treated with drugs were also linked to an increased risk for mental disorders, the researchers found. </p><p>Specifically, they found that children who had been hospitalized with an infection had an 84 percent increased risk of being diagnosed with a mental disorder and a 42 percent increased risk of being prescribed drugs to treat the disorder.</p><p>It seems that infections and the inflammatory reaction that follows can affect the young brain and be part of the process of developing mental disorders, Kohler-Forsberg explained.</p><p>\"This can, however, also be explained by other causes, such as some people having a genetically higher risk of suffering more infections and mental disorders,\" he said.</p><p>How infections increase the risk for mental illness isn't clear, Kohler-Forsberg said.</p><p>The frequent infections that everyone experiences do not generally harm the body or the brain, he said. In fact, infections are necessary to develop the immune system.</p><p>\"But for some individuals, an infection can affect the brain and lead to lasting damage, although this is a rare event,\" Kohler-Forsberg said.</p><p>For the study, researchers collected data on more than 1 million people born in Denmark between 1995 and 2012. Among these, nearly 4 percent were hospitalized for a mental disorder and more than 5 percent were taking drugs to treat their condition.</p><p>Kohler-Forsberg's team found that infections treated with medications, especially antibiotics, were associated with an increased risk for mental illness. The extent of the risk varied by the type of mental disorder. Bacterial infections conferred the highest risk.</p><p>The mental conditions that were most commonly linked with having been hospitalized for an infectious disease include schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, personality and behavior disorders, mental retardation, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and tics, the researchers reported. </p><p>\"A better understanding of the role of infections and antimicrobial therapy in the development of mental disorders might lead to new methods for the prevention and treatment of these devastating disorders,\" Kohler-Forsberg said. </p><p>He cautioned again that these are general associations and do not say much about any single infection.</p><p>\"Therefore, parents should generally not be worried, Kohler-Forsberg said. \"We also showed in a different paper that cognition is not affected by the number of infections in childhood.\"</p><p>Research over the last few decades has revealed many complex interactions between the mind and the immune system, said Dr. Timothy Sullivan, chair of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City. </p><p>These include correlations between inflammation and symptoms of depression, as well as gut microbes and emotional health. Strong associations between mental illness and some physical conditions -- such as heart disease, cancer and arthritis -- also exist, he said.</p><p>\"As yet, although we have identified some of the cellular and physiological mechanisms through which these interactions may occur, we have not fully elucidated the links, and some in the scientific community, as a result, remain unsure that these observations are anything more than coincidence,\" Sullivan said.</p><p>As insights from the developing knowledge of the human genome and gene functions increase, \"understanding the impact of even routine illnesses on the risk for mental illness will be a crucial component of scientific inquiry, and will allow us to one day -- hopefully soon -- anticipate and treat those risks directly,\" he added.</p><p>The report was published online Dec. 5 in the journal <i>JAMA Psychiatry</i>.  </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Mental Health has more on the link between <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/directors/thomas-insel/blog/2010/microbes-and-mental-illness.shtml\" target=\"_new\">infections and mental illness</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Dec. 18, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Folks feeling lonely as the holidays approach have a lot of company, a new study suggests.</p><p>Loneliness appears to be widespread among Americans, affecting three out of every four people, researchers have found.</p><p>Further, loneliness appears to spike at specific times during adulthood. Your late 20s, mid-50s and late 80s are times when you are most at risk of feeling lonely.</p><p>Wisdom appeared to be a strong factor in avoiding feelings of loneliness, the researchers said. People who had qualities of wisdom -- empathy, compassion, control over their emotions, self-reflection -- were much less likely to feel lonely.</p><p>The extent of loneliness detected in the study was a \"surprise, because this was a normal population,\" said senior researcher Dr. Dilip Jeste, a professor of psychiatry and neuroscience with the University of California, San Diego. \"This was not a group of people at high risk for emotional problems.\"</p><p>On the other hand, the peaks of loneliness discovered in the study made sense to Jeste.</p><p>\"These are three periods of life that are full of stress for different reasons,\" Jeste said.</p><p>For this study, Jeste and his colleagues surveyed 340 average adults, aged 27 to 101, living in San Diego. Each person's loneliness was measured using several different measures, including a 20-point loneliness scale developed at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).</p><p>About 76 percent of people showed serious signs of loneliness based on results from the UCLA questionnaire, with 54 percent gauged as moderately lonely and 22 percent ranked as highly lonely.</p><p>Loneliness might not mean what you think it means, however.</p><p>\"There's a misperception that loneliness means social isolation,\" Jeste said. \"Loneliness is subjective. It is what you feel. The definition of loneliness is distress because of a discrepancy between actual social relationships and desired social relationships. There's a discrepancy between what I want and what I have.\"</p><p>Thus, people can feel lonely even if they are married and have a network of friends, if in their hearts they feel like it's not enough, Jeste explained.</p><p>That said, highly lonely people were more likely to be single, live alone and have a personal income less than $35,000, the investigators found.</p><p>The observed peak time periods for loneliness reflected ages that can be challenging in a person's life, Jeste noted:</p><ul><li>The late 20s are a time when people are making choices that will affect the rest of their lives, such as their career, their choice of life partner and where they will settle. \"It really puts a lot of responsibility on you,\" Jeste said. \"It's a really difficult period. And when you compare yourself to others, you might feel you aren't doing as well as your peers.\"</li> <li>The mid-50s are when people tend to experience a mid-life crisis, as signs of aging highlight the fact that their time on Earth is limited. \"You see some of your friends dying, sometimes family members,\" Jeste said. \"You become aware of your mortality for the first time.\"</li><li>The late 80s are a time of increased helplessness. Half of people at this age have dementia, and their physical abilities are in decline. \"Often you've lost your spouse, and you don't have many people left around you, either family or friends,\" Jeste said.</li></ul><p>People suffering from loneliness tended to have more depression, anxiety and stress in their lives, the study authors added.</p><p>And according to Craig Sawchuk, chair of Integrated Behavioral Health at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., loneliness and its accompanying emotional turmoil can harm a person's physical health. </p><p>People who are lonely can tend to become homebodies, Sawchuk  said. He was not involved with the study but was familiar with the findings.</p><p>\"If we're finding loneliness increases, you might see an increase in sedentary lifestyle as well,\" which can lead to high blood pressure, diabetes and heart problems, Sawchuk said. \"These mental effects do have a wear and tear on us physically.\"</p><p>Wisdom appears to serve as a buffer against loneliness, with specific components that provide important context in dealing with those feelings.</p><p>For example, Jeste suggested, people better able to control their emotions can more capably handle anxiety related to loneliness, and those who self-reflect have a greater understanding of why they feel lonely.</p><p>Spirituality and empathy help a person feel more connected with others, he added. \"You know you are part of a much larger cosmos. You are never alone,\" Jeste said. \"There is something else besides you that will always be there.\"</p><p> Julianne Holt-Lunstad is a professor of psychology and neuroscience with Brigham Young University in Utah. She said that while self-understanding is important, people fighting feelings of loneliness should not underestimate the importance of getting out there and interacting with others who share their values or interests.</p><p>Social connection can be thought of as a fundamental need for human beings, like food and water, Holt-Lunstad added. If so, loneliness is similar to hunger and thirst -- a motivator for people to meet that need.</p><p>\"If it's the motive to seek out social connection or that recognition we are lacking that connection, it seems like that should be a part of the solution rather than just trying to suppress the symptoms,\" she said.</p><p>But since loneliness is subjective, the solution to overcoming those feelings will be completely personal to each individual, Holt-Lunstad noted. For example, she pointed to one study that found getting involved in social groups ranked high both as what had worked for people and what had not worked to combat loneliness.</p><p>\"The solution might not be the same for everybody,\" Holt-Lunstad said.</p><p>The new study was published online Dec. 18 in the journal <i>International Psychogeriatrics</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Association for Psychological Science has more about <a href=\"https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/understanding-loneliness-through-science.html\" target=\"_new\">loneliness</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Jan. 7, 2019 (American Heart Association) -- A new study suggests that high levels of inorganic phosphate -- a preservative widely used in certain sodas, packaged meats and other processed foods -- may be a reason why the U.S. population isn't as physically active as it used to be.</p> <p>Researchers from UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas looked at the effect of phosphate on both mice and humans and found each had similar associations with reduced activity level and increased sedentary time.</p> <p>Phosphate is a particle that comes from the mineral phosphorus, which the body needs to build healthy teeth and bones. It can be found naturally in some foods, including nuts, eggs and dairy products. But inorganic phosphate frequently gets added to certain foods to enhance appearance and flavor or increase its shelf life.</p> <p>An estimated 40 percent to 70 percent of top-selling grocery items, including cola drinks, prepared frozen foods, dry food mixes, packaged meat and bakery products contain phosphate additives, notes the study published Monday in the American Heart Association journal <i>Circulation</i>. As a result, up to 25 percent of U.S. adults consume threefold to fourfold the recommended daily allowance of phosphate on a regular basis.</p> <p>To mirror that type of exposure, researchers took two groups of healthy mice and fed them similar diets, except one group was fed more than three times as much phosphate.</p> <p>After 12 weeks, the mice on the high phosphate diet spent less time on the treadmill and took in less oxygen when they did exercise compared to the mice in the control group. They also had a reduced ability to burn fat and showed changes in more than 5,000 genes that aid in processing fatty acids and cell metabolism, which the body uses as an energy source.</p> <p>In a separate part of the study that looked at humans, researchers found a similar correlation between high phosphate levels and reduced physical activity.</p> <p>Analyzing data on 1,603 healthy people whose activity was monitored with a fitness tracker for seven days, researchers found that higher serum phosphate levels  or the amount of phosphate in the blood  were associated with less time spent on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and more time being sedentary.</p> <p>The federal government currently doesn't require phosphate levels to be included on food labels, making it difficult for people to monitor phosphate intake, said Dr. Wanpen Vongpatanasin, the study's senior author and a professor of medicine at UT Southwestern Medical Center.</p> <p>\"I think it might be about time for us to push the food industry to put this on labels so that we can see how much phosphate goes into our food, but this is just the beginning\" and more research is needed to support the effort, she said.</p> <p>Previous studies have linked higher phosphate intake to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and death, particularly in people with kidney disease.</p> <p>Normal kidneys eliminate excess phosphate from the body, which is why an overload of phosphate is a problem for people with impaired kidneys, said Dr. Myles Wolf, professor of medicine and chief of nephrology at Duke University School of Medicine in North Carolina.</p> <p>The new study is \"an important addition to a growing body of work suggesting the deleterious effects of consuming an abundance of phosphate in the diet,\" said Wolf, who was not connected with the research.</p> <p>\"I think the animal data is outstanding,\" he said. \"It's really fascinating, and I think one can take those animal findings and now do some additional human research that would get more at the specifics the study's authors are hypothesizing.\"</p> <p>Wolf said one big strength of the study is that it helps alert the public to how widespread phosphate additives are.</p> <p>\"There's relatively low awareness of dietary phosphate as a potential harmful food constituent in excessive amounts,\" he said. The study adds to \"a growing chorus that suggests more attention should be paid to dietary phosphate consumption and its supplementation by the food industry in the food supply.\"</p>",

While it is important to gather more evidence, data suggest that certain substances in kratom have opioid properties and that one or more have the potential for abuse,\" Gottlieb said.</p><p>\"For individuals seeking treatment for opioid use disorder who are being told that kratom can be an effective treatment, I urge you to seek help from a health care provider,\" he said.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>FDA to Update Medical Device Approvals Process</b></span></p><p>A major update of the United States' system for approving medical devices was announced Monday by the Food and Drug Administration.</p><p>Experts have long criticized the decades-old process for its failure to identify problems with risky medical implants and instruments, <i>CBS News/Associated Press</i> reported.</p><p>The revised process will ensure that new medical devices meet safety and effectiveness standards, according to the FDA.</p><p>Currently, medical device makes are generally allowed to introduce new products based on similarities to decades-old products, without having to conduct new clinical trials in patients, <i>CBS/AP</i> reported.</p><p>\"We believe that newer devices should be compared to the benefits and risks of more modern technology,\" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement.</p><p>Some of the proposed changes could take years to implement, according to <i>CBS/AP</i>.</p><p>The FDA's announcement came a day after the release of findings from an investigation into medical device safety worldwide that was led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and included more than 50 media organizations.</p><p>It found that more than 1.7 million injuries and nearly 83,000 deaths suspected of being caused by medical devices were reported to the FDA over a 10-year period, <i>CBS/AP</i> reported.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>CDC Confirms 116 Cases of Polio-Like Condition</b></span></p><p>There have been 116 confirmed cases of a polio-like condition called acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) in the United States so far this year, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.</p><p>The cases have occurred in 31 states and most have involved children, <i>NBC News</i> reported Monday.</p><p>In its latest update, the CDC says it is investigating 286 cases of AFM, and still does not have a confirmed cause for the disease, which causes muscle weakness or paralysis due to spinal cord damage.</p><p>High on the list of suspects are enteroviruses, which typically cause nothing worse than the common cold, <i>NBC News</i> reported.</p><p>\"Respiratory illnesses and fever from viral infections such as enteroviruses are common, especially in children, and most people recover. We don't know why a small number of patients develop AFM, while most others recover,\" the CDC said.</p><p>The agency noted that AFM cases in the United States rise and fall year to year, with 120 confirmed cases in 2014, 22 cases in 2015, 149 cases in 2016 and 33 cases in 2017, <i>NBC News</i> reported.</p><p>-----</p><p><span class=\"subhead\"><b>Claim About World's First Gene-Edited Babies Triggers Questions, Condemnation</b></span></p><p>A unproven claim about the creation of the world's first genetically edited babies has been met with skepticism and condemnation.</p><p>He Jiankui, Southern University of Science and Technology of China in Shenzhen, said he altered embryos for seven couples during fertility treatments, resulting in a pregnancy that led to twin girls born this month, the <i>Associated Press</i> reported.</p><p>The objective was to give the babies the ability to resist possible future infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, according to He, who did not reveal the identity of the parents, where they live, or where the research was conducted.</p><p>The claim has not been independently confirmed and has not been published in a journal, where it would be reviewed by other experts. He revealed it Monday to one of the organizers of an international conference on gene editing scheduled to begin in Hong Kong Tuesday, and in earlier interviews with the <i>AP</i>.</p><p>He has two genetics companies and has applied for patents on his embryo gene editing methods.</p><p>This type of gene editing is not allowed in the United States because the DNA changes can affect future generations and there is risk of damage to other genes. A number of scientists condemned He's research, and some labeled it human experimentation.</p><p>It's \"unconscionable ... an experiment on human beings that is not morally or ethically defensible,\" Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert and editor of a genetics journal, told the <i>AP</i>.</p><p>\"This is far too premature,\" said Dr. Eric Topol, heads of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California. \"We're dealing with the operating instructions of a human being. It's a big deal.\"</p><p>But attempting gene editing to protect against HIV is \"justifiable,\" because it's \"a major and growing public health threat,\" Harvard University geneticist George Church, told the <i>AP</i>.</p><p>Several scientists who reviewed materials that He provided to the <i>AP</i> said there is not enough data to determine if the gene editing was effective or safe.</p><p>They also said it appears that the gene editing was incomplete and that at least one twin seems to have a patchwork of cells with various genetic changes.</p><p>\"It's almost like not editing at all\" if only some of particular cells were changed, because HIV infection can still occur, Church said.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<!--Spanish ID: 740999 --><p>THURSDAY, Dec. 27, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The scourge of opioid addiction and related deaths cut through American society again in 2018, capturing headlines and making it the year's top health story.</p><p>Rates of opioid-linked fatal overdoses have nearly doubled over the past decade and topped 70,000 in 2017, according to data released in November by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Many of those tragic deaths occurred among young adults and were linked to fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that's 50 times more potent than heroin.</p><p>All of this means that for three years in a row, U.S. average life expectancy reversed a long-term upward trend and actually dropped -- from nearly 79 years in 2014 to 78.6 years now.</p><p>\"We've been talking about the fact that our children will live less long than we will, and that's clearly coming to pass,\" said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.</p><p>Other top health stories of 2018, as compiled by editors at <i>HealthDay</i>:</p><p><b>Vaping rates soar among the young</b></p><p>Even as smoking rates fell to all-time lows among teens, another form of addictive nicotine intake, the e-cigarette, was poised to take its place.</p><p>The latest federal data on youth behaviors found vaping among American teenagers rising dramatically in 2018, with nearly two of every five high school seniors (37 percent) reporting they've tried an e-cigarette during the past year. That's up from 28 percent the year before.</p><p>Many worry that the sleek \"cool\" factor of the leading e-cigarette brand, Juul, may be luring the young to take up vaping -- which many experts worry is a merely a bridge to traditional smoking.</p><p>Seeking to reverse these trends, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in November announced that it would take steps to limit or ban access to flavored e-cigarettes, much favored by teens.</p><p><b>A deadly flu season</b></p><p>A virulent dominant strain of influenza, relatively low uptake of the flu shot, and a poor match between the vaccine and the dominant strains of virus combined to make 2017-2018 one of the worst flu seasons in recent memory.</p><p>Over 80,000 people -- many of them the frail elderly or the very young -- died from complications of flu, the CDC reported, and hospitals were jammed with patients battling the virus.</p><p>So far, the new season seems milder, but CDC experts warn that influenza can still bring surprises, so they urge vaccination.</p><p><b>With growing acceptance, marijuana use rises</b></p><p>By 2018, 33 U.S. states had legalized marijuana for medical use, and neighboring Canada also legalized the drug for recreational use. Aging baby boomers seemed to embrace pot, and in a <i>HealthDay/Harris Poll</i> conducted in July, 85 percent of U.S. adults agreed that pot should be allowed for medical purposes, while 57 percent supported recreational use.</p><p>One legal marijuana derivative product, medicinal CBD oil, became hugely popular in 2018. A form of CBD liquid, Epidiolex, became the first marijuana-derived drug ever approved by the FDA. It is used to help ease certain forms of epilepsy.</p><p>Not everyone was happy about widening access to marijuana, however.</p><p>\"The problem here is we're at the beginning of this massive experiment with unknown outcomes,\" said Fred Muench, president and CEO of the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids.</p><p><b>Obamacare holds on another year</b></p><p>Despite promises by the Trump White House and Republicans in Congress to repeal it, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) -- also known as \"Obamacare\" -- kept providing health care to Americans in 2018.</p><p>In fact, despite pessimistic mid-year predictions, ACA sign-ups for 2018 held steady at near 12 million, and were only down slightly for 2019.</p><p>However, threats to the program remained: In December, a federal judge in Texas deemed the ACA unconstitutional -- a ruling that could end up before the Supreme Court.</p><p><b>Gene-targeted 'personalized' medicine brings new hope against cancer</b></p><p>When former President Jimmy Carter announced that a gene-focused immunotherapy drug called Keytruda had pushed back his metastatic brain tumor, Americans began to understand the potential of this new generation of medicines.</p><p>Drugs like Keytruda, Yervoy, Opdivo and others target genes specific to an individual patient's tumor. This greatly improves treatment success rates while minimizing side effects.</p><p>The field is expanding to a wide range of drugs fighting a host of tumor types, said one oncologist.</p><p>\"I'm a lung cancer doc. We just had our fifth drug for a specific genomic driver in lung cancer approved last week. That started out from zero in 2004,\" noted Dr. Bruce Johnson, past president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.</p><p><b>Tainted lettuce puts a damper on Thanksgiving</b></p><p>Americans sitting down for their Thanksgiving dinners had to forgo Caesar salads this year. That's because E. coli contamination in irrigation water at one California farm (but possibly more) caused the FDA to urge Americans to avoid the leafy green.</p><p>The outbreak caused 59 illnesses so severe that dozens were sent to the hospital, although no deaths were reported.</p><p><b>Big changes to common cancer screens</b></p><p>In May, expert cancer panels made two big revisions to screening protocols used by millions.  First, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) re-opened the door for men to once again use the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test for prostate cancer, saying that men aged 55 to 69 should decide for themselves whether to undergo the test.</p><p>Next, the American Cancer Society lowered the starting age for colon cancer screening from 50 to 45, citing a rise in the cancer among the young.</p><p>Finally, in August, another USPSTF panel said that women over 30 now have a range of cervical cancer screening options. These include an HPV (human papillomavirus) test just once every five years --  dispensing with the traditional Pap test.</p><p><b>Mysterious 'polio-like' illness strikes kids</b></p><p>Cases of a rare but devastating illness called acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) grew among U.S. children again in 2018, with numbers affected by the paralyzing illness approaching 300 by year's end. The condition appears linked to infection with enteroviruses, which typically cause only mild illnesses such as common colds. For now, AFM's origins and treatment remain unclear, the CDC has said.</p>",

The strategy was inspired by hospital wound care. Because putting zinc oxide on open surgical wounds reduces corynebacteria and the bad smell it creates, researchers thought it might also make an effective deodorant.</p><p>The study authors said their small, early trial with 30 healthy volunteers stopped stink cold. That's because zinc oxide kills the two types of bacteria that cause underarm odor -- Corynebacterium spp. and Staphylococcus spp.</p><p>\"Even though it contained no fragrance like conventional deodorants, the participants could identify that it had neutralized any bad odor under the arm where it was applied,\" said lead researcher Dr. Magnus Agren, of the Copenhagen Wound Healing Center at Bispebjerg Hospital, in Denmark.</p> <p>But don't breathe easy just yet: This fragrance-free deodorant isn't yet available, though Colgate-Palmolive, who makes it and paid for the trial, hopes to bring it to market.</p><p>The findings were scheduled for presentation Saturday at a meeting of the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. </p><p>For the 13-day study, 30 men and women volunteered to try zinc oxide. They were randomly assigned to have zinc oxide in one armpit and a placebo in the other.</p><p>The researchers took samples of the study participants' underarm bacteria and caused small wounds in the area. Participants were asked if they detected a difference in scent between their left and right armpit and, if so, which smelled better.</p><p>Compared with placebo, levels of odor-causing bacteria were significantly lower with zinc oxide, the findings showed. It also reduced the redness caused by the wounds and promoted healing, the investigators noted in a meeting news release. </p><p>Research presented at meetings is typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>To learn more about perspiration, visit the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/sweat.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Institutes of Health</a>.</p>",

These might be about values, perceptions or concrete concepts, from how to give a presentation at work to differing parenting techniques.</p><p>Conflict can ruin personal as well as business relationships, so knowing how to resolve differences is an important life skill. It starts with accepting that the other person's point of view is legitimate and being willing to discuss your differences in an open, non-judgmental way with the goal of problem solving, and not to determine a winner and a loser.</p><p>4 keys to resolving conflict:</p><ul><li>Recognize and address important differences -- don't bury or stew over them.</li><li>Be able to \"forgive and forget.\"</li><li>Compromise without retribution.</li><li>Accept that a resolution can accommodate both people.</li></ul><p>How to put these into action?</p><p>Your approach matters: Try to stay calm and focus on the specific problem, not those five <i>other</i> things that have been bothering you. Acknowledge your emotions, but don't let them dictate the conversation. Be aware of any negative body language you're showing, such as avoiding eye contact, a negative facial expression, a harsh tone of voice or angry posture. Think about it: Crossed arms don't convey open-mindedness. A caring tone and using humor can help diffuse tension as you start to talk.</p><p>Be specific as you use words to reframe the situation and honestly express your feelings without anger or other emotions. Then do the most important thing: Listen to the other person's viewpoint and make sure you understand it by repeating it. Together you can find a solution.</p><p>It might be hard to believe when you're feeling angry, but if approached in a respectful way, conflict can strengthen the bond between two people.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The University of Texas at Austin Counseling and Mental Health Center has numerous articles on <a href=\"https://cmhc.utexas.edu/fightingfair.html\" target=\"_new\">fighting fair to resolve conflict</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 28, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Many older drivers take medications known to raise the risk of a crash, a new study shows.</p><p>It found that nearly 50 percent of older adults who drive use seven or more medications. Nearly 20 percent take what are called potentially inappropriate medications because they have limited benefits, pose excess risk of harm, or both.</p><p>Most of these potentially inappropriate medications -- including benzodiazepines like Valium and older antihistamines -- can cause blurred vision, confusion, fatigue or clumsiness. That can increase a driver's risk of a crash by up to 300 percent, according to the study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.</p><p>\"There is a growing population of older drivers who use multiple medications and likely do not realize the impact these prescriptions may have on their driving,\" said David Yang, executive director of the foundation.</p><p>\"This new research shows that the more medications an older driver takes, the more likely they are to use an inappropriate medication that can potentially cause driving impairment,\" Yang added in an AAA news release.</p><p>The survey of 3,000 older drivers also found that the most commonly used medications affect driving ability and increase crash risk.</p><p>They include treatments to treat heart and blood vessel conditions (73 percent), as well as pain medications, stimulants and anti-anxiety drugs (70 percent).</p><p>Previous AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety research found that fewer than 18 percent of older drivers said they'd ever been warned by their health care provider about how their prescription drugs can affect driving ability.</p><p>Currently, there are 42 million drivers aged 65 and older in the United States. That number is expected to increase substantially over the next decade, which would make seniors the largest group of drivers.</p><p>\"Taking multiple medications affect all of us, but older drivers can be particularly vulnerable. Ask your doctor and pharmacist as many questions as necessary to ensure you understand why you need the medications prescribed to you, and how they can affect your driving,\" said Jake Nelson, AAA director of traffic safety advocacy and research.</p><p>\"Don't be afraid to question health care providers. It's their job to help you. And the answers may just save your life,\" Nelson said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute on Aging has more about <a href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/older-drivers\" target=\"_new\">older drivers</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>MONDAY, Jan. 7, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Losing a job or taking a big pay cut is hard on more  than just your checkbook -- it might drastically increase your risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure or death.</p><p>A new study finds that people who endure large swings in income over the years are much more likely to develop heart disease or suffer a premature death.</p><p>\"We found that individuals in the highest third of income volatility -- the individuals with the most fluctuation in income -- had an almost double risk of cardiovascular disease and death in the subsequent 10 years, compared with people who had the least fluctuation in income,\" said lead researcher Tali Elfassy. She is an assistant professor at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.</p><p>People who had the most volatile incomes between 1990 and 2005 were a little more than twice as likely to develop heart disease and 78 percent more likely to die from any cause during the following decade, compared with people with the most stable incomes, Elfassy and her colleagues found.</p><p>Further, people who suffered two or more income drops during that same period were 2.5 times more likely to develop heart disease and 92 percent more likely to die from any cause, compared with those who never had their income go down, the study findings showed.</p><p>The study only found an association and couldn't prove that income fluctuations caused health issues.</p><p>However, unstable income can affect a person's health in a number of ways, said Donna Arnett, past president of the American Heart Association and dean of the University of Kentucky College of Public Health.</p><p>People under stress tend to have increased blood pressure and inflammation, likely due to higher levels of the fight-or-flight hormone cortisol, Arnett said. Their ability to process blood sugar also is hampered.</p><p>Those caught in an income squeeze can also have their health affected by more practical problems, Arnett added.</p><p>\"Could it be you can't take your medications because you can't afford them, you can't afford to see a physician, you can't afford the right diet?\" Arnett said. \"I think it's a multitude of reasons that could be contributing to this finding.\"</p><p> Elfassy pointed out that previous studies have linked income to a person's risk of heart disease, but those studies tend to focus on income at one single point in time.</p><p>\"As we all know, income changes throughout life,\" Elfassy said. \"For this study, we were interested in changes in income over time and how that is associated with disease and mortality.\"</p><p>To explore that topic, the researchers turned to a large-scale ongoing heart study being conducted in four urban areas in the United States: Chicago; Minneapolis; Birmingham, Ala.; and Oakland, Calif. The investigators gathered data on nearly 4,000 participants who were between the ages of 23 and 35 back in 1990.</p><p>As part of the study, people reported their income five times between 1990 and 2005, at regular intervals. The researchers assessed income volatility based on large swings in income.</p><p>The team then tracked these people to see if income changes were associated with their health outcomes.</p><p>Only about 5 percent of the sample had absolutely no changes in income during the 15-year period, while about 90 percent experienced at least one pay increase, the researchers reported.</p><p>\"Individuals with higher income volatility were more likely to be women, black, have lower income in general, and less likely to be married,\" Elfassy said. \"They also had less years of education than those who did not have income fluctuation.\"</p><p>So, what should you do if you're someone with highly unstable income?</p><p> Arnett said that it's difficult to remain heart-healthy when you're facing the stress of a job loss or pay cut.</p><p>\"When you're in those situations that are stressful, it's hard to do what is best. You go into survival mode. You may be more likely to have a beer and have a cigarette for stress relief,\" Arnett added.</p><p>On the other hand, Elfassy said, getting a little exercise can help ward off the harmful effects of a dissolving paycheck.</p><p>\"You don't need to take an expensive yoga class. Simply going for a 15-minute walk every day would have benefits in and of itself. There are low-cost ways to adequately obtain physical activity,\" Elfassy said.</p><p>The study was published online Jan. 7 in the journal <i>Circulation</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart Association has more about <a href=\" https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/stress-and-heart-health \" target=\"_new\">stress and heart disease</a>.</p>",

But now the source seems to be \"end of season\" lettuce, harvested somewhere in the Central Coast regions of central and northern California.</p><p>And, \"harvesting of romaine lettuce from this region has [already]  ended for the year,\" Gottlieb noted.</p><p>So, starting as early as this week, romaine lettuce sold in stores will carry labels listing the region where the produce was grown, along with its harvest date, the FDA said. By checking these labels, consumers can quickly determine that the produce is safe to eat.</p><p>\"Romaine lettuce that was harvested outside of the Central Coast growing regions of northern and central California does not appear to be related to the current outbreak,\" Gottlieb stressed.</p><p>That would include romaine farmed in Arizona, Florida and Mexico, as well as California's Imperial Valley -- lettuce harvested from these areas is OK to eat.</p><p>\"Hydroponically- and greenhouse-grown romaine also does not appear to be related to the current outbreak,\" Gottlieb added. \"There is no recommendation for consumers or retailers to avoid using romaine harvested from these sources.\"</p><p>If heads of romaine are sold loose, without affixed labels, retailers are being asked to post a notice showing place and date of harvest near the store register.</p><p>Such labeling may become standard going forward, according to an agreement between the FDA and the leafy greens industry, the agency said.</p><p>So far, 43 people across 12 states have been sickened in this latest outbreak of E. coli, with onset in the last case occurring on Oct. 31.</p> <p>Twenty-two more cases have been reported in Canada. No deaths have yet been reported in the outbreak.</p><p>\"Through laboratory studies we have identified that theE. coliO157:H7 strain causing the outbreak is similar to one that produced an outbreak ofE. coliO157:H7 in thefall of 2017 that also occurred in the U.S. and Canada, which was associated with consumption of leafy greens in the U.S. and specifically romaine lettuce in Canada,\" Gottlieb said.</p><p>So who's most at risk from E. coli?</p><p>Dr. Robert Glatter is an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City who's seen the effects of infection with the gastrointestinal bug firsthand. It's not a minor ailment, he said.</p><p>\"In general, symptoms of E. coli infection generally begin about three to four days after consuming the bacteria, and may include abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and watery or bloody diarrhea, along with fever,\" Glatter said.</p><p>And while healthy people who battle a bout of E. coli typically recover within five to seven days, the illness can be more protracted -- and even deadly -- for people already made vulnerable by chronic disease or advanced age.</p><p>\"People with diabetes, kidney disease or those with cancer or autoimmune disease run the risk of a more severe illness,\" Glatter explained.</p><p>The particular strain of E. coli detected in the current lettuce outbreak -- E. coli O157:H7 -- is particularly nasty, he noted.</p><p>\"Most strains of E. coli do not actually cause diarrhea, but E. coli O157 produces a powerful toxin that injures the inner lining of the small intestine, leading to bloody diarrhea,\" Glatter said. Even a tiny amount of ingested bacteria could spur this type of illness.</p><p>\"It can make people much more ill, and may lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure, in some cases,\" he said.</p><p>Indeed, the CDC has reported one such case already in the latest outbreak.</p><p>In many cases, antibiotics are used to help beat back an E. coli infection, but these drugs can affect the kidneys, Glatter noted.</p><p>\"Antibiotics may be necessary in certain cases, so it's important to see your doctor if you have continued and severe symptoms such as fever, bloody diarrhea, and you are not able to eat or drink,\" he said.</p><p>However, in the case of E. coli O157:H7, \"taking antibiotics may actually increase your risk of developing kidney failure, so it's important to speak with your health care provider if you should develop severe symptoms,\" Glatter advised.</p><p>And if you do think you might be sick with E. coli, or any other foodborne illness, make sure you don't spread it to those near you.</p><p>The bacterium \"can be transmitted person-to-person, so it's vital that anyone who is potentially infected wash their hands thoroughly and not share utensils, cups or glasses,\" Glatter said. \"This also goes for bath towels. Linens also need to be washed in hot water and treated with bleach.\"</p><p>He noted that \"ground beef, unpasteurized milk, fresh produce and contaminated water are common sources of E. coli bacteria.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Find out more about E. coli illness at the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/ecoli-symptoms.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 27, 2018 (HealthDay News) --What if a simple zap to the spine could relieve the debilitating lower back and leg pain brought on by a herniated disk?</p><p>Such is the promise of \"pulse radiofrequency\" therapy (pRF), which sends inflammation-reducing pulses of energy to nerve roots in the spine, a new study claims.</p><p>The therapy is not new, having first received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in the 1980s.</p><p>But recent advances in CT scan technology now enable clinicians to deploy those energy pulses with much more accuracy, experts said. And the new research suggests the treatment could prove a boon to back pain patients for whom standard therapies have failed to do the trick.</p><p>\"I was amazed with the results of pRF,\" said study author Dr. Alessandro Napoli. \"Especially having read, as a radiologist, numerous lumbar MRI scans of patients with recurrent hernia after surgery.\"</p><p>And as a patient himself, Napoli added that \"from personal experience I can tell you that the treatment is not painful, and the results are appreciated within days after a single treatment lasting 10 minutes.\"</p><p>Napoli is a professor of interventional radiology at Sapienza University of Rome in Italy.</p><p>He and his colleagues plan to report their findings Tuesday at the Radiological Society of North America annual meeting, in Chicago. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>Lower disk herniation results when the insulating disks that sit between spinal vertebrae tear open, allowing jelly-like material to protrude and exert pressure on surrounding nerve roots. Beyond lower back pain, the condition often triggers sciatica, a pain that radiates down a patient's leg.</p><p>Standard therapies include over-the-counter pain meds, corticosteroid spinal injections, and/or invasive spine surgery that sometimes involves disk removal and vertebrae fusion.</p><p>The problem, said Napoli, is that such options entail risks without assured relief.</p><p>\"Steroid injections are effective only in portion of the patients, and generally require more sessions,\" he noted. And though surgery safety has \"largely improved,\" Napoli pointed to the risk for bleeding and infection, the need for a minimum two- to three-day hospital stay, the high cost, and the fact that some patients ultimately realize little benefit.</p><p>By contrast, pRF is scalpel-free, delivering radio signals directly to affected nerves via a CT scan-guided electrode. The process, said Napoli, requires no hospital stay, is noninvasive, far cheaper and less risky.</p><p>\"The rationale for using pRF on disk herniation is that we eliminate the inflammation process of the compromised nerve root,\" he explained. \"Without inflammation the pain fades, and the body starts a self-healing process that allows for complete resolution of the disk herniation in a large proportion of patients.\"</p><p>For the study, the Italian investigators compared 128 lumbar herniation patients who underwent a single 10-minute round of CT-guided pRF with 120 patients who received one to three rounds of steroid injections.</p><p>All the patients had already undergone standard interventions, with poor results.</p><p>By the one-year mark following either treatment, a full \"perceived\" recovery was reported by 95 percent of the pRF patients, compared with just 61 percent of the steroid injection patients.</p><p>Dr. Daniel Park, director of minimally invasive orthopedic spine surgery at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich., offered some caution on the findings.</p><p>He noted that because \"the majority of people with back pain improve with time and exercise alone,\" it remains an open question as to whether the pRF procedure really cured the condition.</p><p>Still, Park noted that diagnostic uncertainty can undermine the ability of surgery to get at the true source of a patient's pain, given that \"the problem with low back pain is that there are many causes of it, and physicians have trouble identifying the cause of pain.\"</p><p>Nevertheless, he remains unsure if pRF is truly ready for prime time.</p><p>\"Best case, I think [pRF] could be an option for people if they [have already] failed therapy and medication,\" said Park. \"It may be a similar option for people if they do not or cannot have steroid injections, but they need more treatment. I think this is experimental, and should not be first-line.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons offers more information on <a href=\"https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/herniated-disk-in-the-lower-back\" target=\"_new\">herniated disks</a>.</p>",

Scientists now say it may help prevent atrial fibrillation after heart surgery.  </p><p>A-fib -- an abnormal heart rhythm -- is common after heart surgery, and it's linked to stroke and heart failure. But two new studies suggest that botox injections during surgery temporarily freeze nerve bundles in the heart, preventing the dangerous complication. </p><p>In one study, botox injected into the fat pads near each pulmonary vein reduced odds of atrial fibrillation by 64 percent.</p><p>The effect lasted over three years, long after the botox itself dissipated, said lead researcher Dr. Jonathan Steinberg. </p><p>\"Atrial fibrillation typically lengthens hospital stays and can have complications. Other drugs have been tried, but nothing has come out that is a solid, reliable performer, and there is no standard of care,\" said Steinberg. He is  director of the SMG Arrhythmia Center at the Summit Medical Group in Short Hills, N.J. </p><p>In his study, 60 patients undergoing heart bypass surgery were randomly assigned to either botox or an inactive placebo. All received implantable cardiac monitors that tracked occurrence of atrial fibrillation.</p><p>In the botox group, risk of a-fib dropped immediately after surgery, and fell fivefold to ninefold each year of the three-year follow-up, the researchers found. </p><p>Also during follow-up, significantly fewer botox recipients were hospitalized for a-fib or needed treatment for it compared to the placebo group.</p><p>Botox, or botulinum toxin, blocks signals from the nerves to the muscles. It's a well-known tool in cosmetic surgery, and some doctors use it to treat neurological disorders including migraine, excessive sweating and eye muscle problems.</p><p>In heart surgery, Steinberg said the drug appears to interrupt \"cardiac neural traffic.\"</p><p>He believes the findings suggest a new approach to treatment.</p> <p>In the other study, Dr. Nathan Waldron and colleagues randomly assigned 130 patients to receive an injection of either botox or placebo while undergoing heart bypass surgery.</p><p>\"Injecting botulinum toxin into fat pads surrounding the heart during cardiac surgery may be a promising strategy to reduce atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery, but further study is needed,\" said Waldron, an assistant professor of anesthesiology at Duke University in Durham, N.C. </p><p>The reduction in a-fib risk among the botox group wasn't statistically significant -- only 11 percent -- but the episodes were shorter and less severe, researchers found. This finding may be due to the small size of the study, Waldron's team said.</p><p>Dr. Gregg Fonarow is director of the cardiomyopathy center at the University of California, Los Angeles, and co-director of the UCLA preventative cardiology program.</p><p>Developing effective and safe strategies to lower a-fib risk after surgery has been a challenge, he said.</p><p>\"These new studies, while modest in size, suggest that there is the potential for epicardial fat pad injection of botulinum toxin performed during the cardiac surgery to lower the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation,\" Fonarow said.</p><p>However, additional studies involving larger numbers of patients are needed, he added.</p><p>The reports were recently published online in the journal <i>HeartRhythm</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more about atrial fibrillation, visit the <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/atrial-fibrillation/what-is-atrial-fibrillation-afib-or-af\" target=\"_new\"> American Heart Association</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 6, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Cases of uterine cancer are charting a slow but steady rise among American women, and so are deaths from the disease, new statistics show.</p><p>Looking at federal health data, researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that \"during 1999-2015, uterine cancer incidence rates increased 12 percent, about 0.7 percent per year, on average.\"</p><p>More than two-thirds (68 percent) of cases involved cancers of the endometrium, the lining of the uterus.</p><p>Uterine cancers are often curable if detected early, but late detection often means the tumor has spread and can become fatal. According to the new CDC study, deaths due to uterine cancer have also risen steadily, at an average increase of 1.1 percent per year.</p> <p>That means that between 1999 and 2016, \"uterine cancer death rates increased 21 percent,\" wrote researchers led by S. Jane Henley, of the CDC's Division of Cancer Prevention and Control.</p><p>Why the increases? One expert had a theory.</p><p>\"In general, uterine cancers are the result of excess circulating estrogens that occur when a woman is overweight and has completed the menopause,\" said Dr. Benjamin Schwartz. He directs obstetrics and gynecology at Northwell Health's Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y.</p><p>\"Since the obesity epidemic worsened over the years studied, it is not a surprise then that the incidence of uterine cancers also continued to rise,\" Schwartz said.</p><p>Henley and the CDC team agreed. Overweight or obese women \"are approximately two to four times as likely to develop endometrial cancer as are women with healthy weight,\" they pointed out.</p><p>The new report shows that some groups have been hit harder by uterine cancers than others. Most notably, black women had a much higher increase in cases than the general population -- a 2.4 percent annual rise, adding up to a total 46 percent increase in cases between 1999 and 2016.</p><p>Rates for Hispanic women were also significantly higher than the average, the report found.</p><p>Again, obesity may be a factor, Henley's group said. While 2013-2016 statistics showed that 40 percent of all U.S. women were obese, that number rose to 56 percent among black women and 49 percent among Hispanics, the researchers noted.</p><p>All of this means that \"public health efforts to help women achieve and maintain a healthy weight and obtain sufficient physical activity,\" would help bring uterine cancer numbers down, the CDC team said.</p><p>Earlier detection of these cancers would help save lives, especially for minority women.</p><p>The study found that while 8 percent of uterine tumors among women generally were detected only after they had spread to other tissues, that number doubled to 16 percent among black women.</p><p>That may have led to a near-doubling of fatal uterine cancers among black women. On average, 5 out of every 100,000 U.S. women now die from uterine cancer, the study found, but the rate for black women is 9 out of every 100,000.</p><p>\"The data shows clearly that the earlier the cancer is caught, the easier it is to cure,\" according to Schwartz.</p><p>Certain symptoms can alert women to a potential problem.</p><p>According to the CDC researchers, \"an important early symptom of uterine cancer is abnormal vaginal bleeding, including bleeding between periods or after sex or any unexpected bleeding after menopause.\" This symptom occurs in 9 out of 10 uterine cancer cases, they said.</p><p>Dr. Jennifer Wu is an obstetrician-gynecologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. She agreed that \"patients need to know that they should always discuss abnormal uterine bleeding with their doctors.\"</p><p>And despite the new numbers, Wu stressed that advances in treatment are making uterine cancer much less lethal than before.</p><p>\"Treatments for uterine cancer have improved,\" Wu said. \"Uterine cancers can be treated with minimally invasive surgery such as laparoscopy and robotics, and patients can now have quicker recoveries from these types of surgery.\"</p><p>The new research was published Dec. 7 in the CDC journal <i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/types/uterine\" target=\"_new\">uterine cancers</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 6, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Obese people with heart failure may live longer than those who are thinner -- especially if they are \"metabolically healthy,\" a new study suggests.</p><p>The study, of more than 3,500 heart failure patients, is the latest to look into the so-called \"obesity paradox.\" The term refers to a puzzling pattern that researchers have noted for years: Obese patients with heart disease tend to survive longer than their normal-weight counterparts.</p><p>\"It has consistently been observed in large studies,\" said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, co-chief of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"But the mechanisms contributing to this paradox continue to be debated.\"</p><p>Fonarow was not involved in the new research, but has worked on studies reaching similar conclusions.</p><p>The pattern is dubbed a \"paradox\" because obesity actually raises your risk of developing heart disease in the first place.</p><p>So it's not clear, Fonarow said, why it would be linked to better survival after the disease develops.</p><p>In the current study, South Korean researchers followed 3,564 patients who were hospitalized with heart failure symptoms. Overall, about 2,000 were overweight or obese, while more than 1,500 were of normal weight.</p><p>Heart failure is a chronic condition in which the heart muscle can no longer pump blood efficiently enough to meet the body's needs. It causes symptoms such as breathlessness, fatigue and fluid buildup.</p><p>In general, the study found, heavier patients tended to show less deterioration in the structure and function of the heart's main pumping chamber.</p><p>And the highest survival rate was seen among overweight or obese patients who were metabolically healthy -- meaning they did not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or abnormal blood sugar levels.</p><p>Among those patients, more than 79 percent were still alive three years later. That compared with 64 percent of normal-weight patients in good metabolic health.</p><p>Patients in the normal-weight group who were metabolically unhealthy fared worst: Only 55 percent were still alive after three years. Metabolically unhealthy obese people fared about the same as normal-weight, metabolically healthy people -- with a survival rate of about 66 percent. </p><p>However, it was apparently not easy to be overweight and metabolically healthy: Only 12 percent of overweight/obese patients were, said researcher Dr. Chan Soon Park.</p><p>Park, of Seoul National University Hospital, was scheduled to present the findings this week at a meeting of the European Society of Cardiology, in Milan, Italy.</p><p>What do the results mean? They do not prove that obesity, itself, provides a survival advantage, said Dr. Gurusher Panjrath.</p><p>Panjrath, who was not involved in the research, chairs the American College of Cardiology's heart failure and transplant section.</p><p>He noted that the study -- like most previous ones -- used body mass index (BMI) to divide patients into weight categories.</p><p>People with a BMI of 23 or higher were considered \"overweight/obese,\" while those with a lower BMI were considered \"normal-weight.\" For example, a 5-foot-8-inch person who weighs 151 pounds has a BMI of 23. (The definitions used for Asian populations are different from those used in the United States and elsewhere, Park said.)</p><p>But BMI -- a measure of weight in relation to height -- is an imprecise gauge, Panjrath explained.</p><p>He said the normal-weight group in this study might have included some patients who were actually more sick and frail. In contrast, people who had more muscle, and may have been relatively fitter, could have fallen into the overweight category.</p><p>In fact, Panjrath said, a number of studies have suggested that cardiovascular fitness levels -- rather than weight -- are critical to heart disease patients' outlook.</p><p>That includes heart failure.</p><p>Often, people develop heart failure after suffering a heart attack that damages the heart muscle, or because of poorly controlled high blood pressure.</p><p>Obesity is a risk factor because it contributes to the conditions that can cause heart failure, Panjrath explained. There's also some evidence those extra pounds might directly affect heart muscle function, he said.</p><p>Once people are diagnosed with heart failure, Panjrath said, the priority is to boost their fitness levels through exercise, and control conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes.</p><p>\"Fitness is more important than fatness,\" Panjrath said. He added, though, that weight loss is encouraged when patients are severely obese.</p><p>Park said that since weight loss can be difficult, efforts to improve factors like blood pressure and fitness may be more practical.</p><p>Research presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Heart Association has more on <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-failure/treatment-options-for-heart-failure\" target=\"_new\">managing heart failure</a>.</p>",

He is co-director of the Jefferson Thyroid and Parathyroid Center of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.</p> <p>Removing the thyroid is usually a safe procedure. However, some of the side effects of the operation can be so severe that patients need to be hospitalized, Willis explained in a university news release.</p><p>For the study, the researchers used the 2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database to collect data on nearly 23,000 patients who had thyroid surgery. The procedures were done to cure cancer, treat goiter (an enlarged thyroid), or manage an overactive thyroid.</p><p>In all, 4 percent were hospitalized again within 30 days. Most of these patients were readmitted within a week after surgery. Of the patients that needed readmission, 25 percent returned within two days, the researchers found.</p><p>\"Although 4 percent is less than estimates from earlier, smaller studies, it still amounts to nearly 1,000 patients per year whose symptoms are severe enough to seek immediate medical attention and need admission to the hospital,\" said first author Dr. Arturo Rios-Diaz, a surgical resident at Thomas Jefferson University.</p><p>The researchers found that those at the highest risk of being hospitalized were those with Medicare and Medicaid. Also at risk were patients who had low calcium levels after surgery and those who remained in the hospital two days or more after surgery.</p><p>Low calcium levels, or hypocalcemia, is the most common side effect and is usually caused by damage to or removal of the parathyroid glands. The condition can be treated with calcium pills.</p><p>\"Although the standard treatment for hypocalcemia is simple, patients have to be able to get their medications after discharge from their surgery,\" Willis said.</p><p>\"Patients on Medicaid and Medicare could find it financially or logistically difficult to obtain the treatment before the symptoms begin and worsen,\" he suggested.</p><p>Willis said patients should be checked on by phone in the first days after leaving the hospital, when they have the greatest risk for complications.</p><p>The report was published Jan. 3 in the journal <i>Surgery</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Visit the American Thyroid Association for more on <a href=\"https://www.thyroid.org/thyroid-surgery\" target=\"_new\">thyroid surgery</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 28, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Diabetes, high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol are well-known risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what about just getting sick? Could picking up some type of bug increase your chance of having a stroke or heart attack?</p> <p>A new study suggests it could.</p> <p>Researchers have linked infections such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections to an increased risk of having a coronary event, such as a heart attack or stroke, within the next three months.</p> <p>In the study published recently in the <i>Journal of the American Heart Association</i>, researchers examined a registry of patients tracked over multiple years in four U.S. cities. They looked at 1,312 patients who had a heart attack or other type of coronary event, and 727 other patients who had an ischemic stroke, the kind caused by a blood clot.</p> <p>Of the heart disease patients, about 37 percent had some type of infection within the previous three months. Among stroke patients, it was nearly 30 percent.</p> <p>Infections substantially increased the odds of having a heart attack or stroke compared to a year or two earlier in the same group of patients, and those odds were highest in the first two weeks following the infection.</p> <p>Infections generally trigger an inflammatory reaction in the body, said Dr. Kamakshi Lakshminarayan, a neurologist and senior study author of the research.</p> <p>The body triggers its white cell production to help ward off an infection, but that process also increases the stickiness of cells called platelets, she said. This encourages the formation of clots that could block the flow of blood to the heart or brain.</p> <p>\"The infection appears to be the trigger for changing the finely tuned balance in the blood and making us more prone to thrombosis, or clot formation,\" said Lakshminarayan, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Minnesota's medical school. \"It's a trigger for the blood vessels to get blocked up and puts us at higher risk of serious events like heart attack and stroke.\"</p> <p>The study raises questions about whether patients hospitalized for infections should also begin receiving treatment to protect them from heart disease and stroke. Additional research may provide those answers, Lakshminarayan said.</p> <p>Urinary tract infection, or UTI, was the most common type of infection reported in the study, followed by pneumonia and other respiratory infections. Skin and blood infections also were reported.</p> <p>The study included patients treated for infections while hospitalized and those who received outpatient care. Both groups were more likely to have a cardiovascular event within three months of the infection, but this association appeared to be stronger among the inpatient group.</p> <p>That's because infections requiring hospitalizations are probably more severe to begin with, said Juan Badimon, a professor of medicine and director of the atherothrombosis research unit at Mount Sinai School of Medicine's Cardiovascular Institute in New York.</p> <p>\"And if the infection is that severe, we can assume a stronger inflammatory response will result in a higher cardiovascular risk,\" said Badimon, who was not involved in the research but co-authored an editorial that accompanied the study.</p> <p>He described the study's association between cardiovascular events and all types of infections, not just respiratory ones, a \"novel discovery.\" But, he said, he would like to have seen researchers dig deeper and note whether the infection source -- viral or bacterial -- played a role in the increased risk for heart attacks and strokes.</p> <p>Badimon hopes the findings will encourage the public to make sure their vaccinations are up-to-date, especially during flu season.</p> <p>Lakshminarayan agreed.</p> <p>\"One of the biggest takeaways is that we have to prevent these infections whenever possible,\" she said, \"and that means flu shots and pneumonia vaccines, especially for older individuals.\"</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Nov. 28, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Fast tests designed to help primary care doctors rapidly spot dementia in their elderly patients often get it wrong, a new British report contends.</p><p>The finding concerns three widely used quick dementia tests: the \"Mini-Mental State Examination\" (intended to assess mental orientation and verbal memory); the \"Memory Impairment Screen\" (which tests verbal memory); and \"Animal Naming\" (which gives patients one minute to quickly name as many animals as they can).</p><p>The result: more than one-third of the patients were misclassified -- as either having or not having dementia -- by at least one of the rapid tests in question.</p><p>\"Dementia can be difficult to accurately detect, particularly in a primary care setting,\" said study lead author Janice Ranson. But the rapid tests \"are important screening tools to help clinicians decide who is likely to benefit from further testing for dementia,\" she acknowledged.</p><p>\"Our results suggest that some of the misclassification is due to test biases, such as a patient's age, ethnicity or education level,\" she added.</p><p>Ranson is a doctoral researcher in clinical epidemiology at the University of Exeter Medical School in England.</p><p>She and her colleagues reported their findings in the Nov. 28 online issue of the journal <i>Neurology: Clinical Practice</i>.</p><p>Ranson said quick tests are \"routinely used\" by primary care doctors as an initial screening. And if signs of dementia are found, a \"full dementia investigation\" typically ensues.</p><p>The study included just over 800 patients in the United States who underwent the tests. The participants ranged in age from 70 to 110, with an average age of 82. </p><p>The patients initially underwent comprehensive three- to four-hour dementia assessments. These involved a neurological exam, blood pressure readings, a medication review, DNA sampling, depression screening and lifestyle/family history interviews.</p><p>These comprehensive assessments revealed that about one-third of the patients had dementia.</p><p>All of the participants subsequently underwent each of the three quick dementia tests.</p><p>But when the research team compared the quick test results with the in-depth results, they found that 36 percent of the patients were mistakenly diagnosed by at least one of the quick tests.</p><p>Interestingly, the researchers found that individually, each quick test actually had a misdiagnosis rate of 14 to 21 percent, and only 2 percent of the patients were misdiagnosed by all three tests.</p><p>Why? Each test appeared to have a different problematic bias, the study authors said. For example, while one test appeared to underdiagnose dementia in highly educated patients, others appeared to miss the mark based on patient age, race or nursing home status.</p><p>\"Each test is biased in different ways,\" said Ranson, \"and so some tests are more accurate than others for certain patient groups. While these results are at first concerning, knowing the specific limitations for each test will help clinicians decide which is the most appropriate for their patient.\"</p><p>Still, she said there's definitely room for improvement.</p><p>\"We desperately need more accurate and less biased ways of detecting dementia swiftly in clinic,\" said Ranson. \"We are therefore developing new technology, using data science and artificial intelligence, to help clinicians get the best outcome for their patients. We are working hard to improve these tests with a more personalized approach to cognitive testing.\"</p><p>Keith Fargo is director of scientific programs and outreach with the Alzheimer's Association, in Chicago. \"Diagnosing Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia is an incredibly complex process, and not something that can be done on the quick,\" he said.</p><p>\"Simple cognitive tests can be a helpful first step toward diagnosis, but as the study points out, are imperfect,\" Fargo explained.</p><p>\"The Alzheimer's Association supports efforts to better understand and account for potential biases in short assessments for cognitive impairment,\" Fargo added. \"Ensuring a timely and accurate diagnosis is critical, and this study identifies important biases that need to be considered when using these preliminary assessments.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>To learn more about dementia and dementia diagnosis, visit the <a href=\"https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia/\" target=\"_new\">Alzheimer's Association</a>.</p>",

That's a band of nerve fibers that connects and helps \"integrate\" functions between the two halves of the brain.</p><p>The football players' brain scans were also compared to those taken of a \"control\" group of 22 boys who didn't play football.</p><p>Clear differences were seen, according to the researchers who presented the findings Thursday at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), in Chicago.</p><p>\"The years from age 9 to 12 are very important when it comes to brain development,\" said lead study author Jeongchul Kim, of Wake Forest School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C.</p><p> \"The functional regions of the brain are starting to integrate with one another, and players exposed to repetitive brain injuries, even if the amount of impact is small, could be at risk,\" he explained in an RSNA news release. </p><p>\"The body of the corpus callosum is a unique structure that's somewhat like a bridge connecting the left and right hemispheres of the brain,\" Kim said. \"When it's subjected to external forces, some areas will contract and others will expand, just like when a bridge is twisting in the wind.\"</p><p>So, the new study suggests that repeated hits to the head -- as can occur in the rough-and-tumble of football -- may be causing the brain changes seen in these young players.</p><p>Still, the study is not conclusive, and further research is needed to confirm that repeated blows to the head in football and other youth contact sports could lead to changes in the shape of the corpus callosum during this critical time of brain development, Kim said.</p><p>Similar findings were reported on Monday in another study from the RSNA meeting.  In that study, researchers at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas compared pre- and post-season MRI scans from 60 football-playing boys aged 9 to 18.</p><p>Those researchers saw more gray matter volume in the brains of youngsters who had high-impact hits -- but no concussions -- over the season.</p><p>More gray matter brain tissue indicates that the brain might not be working as well as it could be, explained study author Gowtham Krishnan Murugesan.</p><p>One expert who's seen the effects of brain trauma first hand agreed that young people may not need a full-blown concussion to be neurologically changed by head impacts.</p><p>While the sample size in the Wake Forest study is small, \"it demonstrates that structural changes in the brain do in fact develop in children who experience repetitive subconcussive impacts, without immediate symptoms of concussion such as dizziness, headaches or nausea,\" said Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>\"It's vital that parents be aware of the unknown long-term neurological risks after subconcussive hits to the head involved in children playing contact sports,\" he said.</p><p>Glatter also pointed to other research, which has suggested that some kids may be more vulnerable to these brain changes than others, based on their individual genetics.</p><p>Pinpointing these more vulnerable kids \"will be vital in selecting which children are at greater risk when playing contact sports,\" Glatter believes.</p><p>In any case, children are not just \"small adults\" when it comes to head impacts and their effect on the brain, he said.</p><p>\"Because children are growing and developing, they are more susceptible to undergo changes in key structural areas, such as the corpus callosum, which is important in thinking, reasoning, and motor functions between the right and left sides of the brain,\" Glatter explained.</p><p>Research presented at medical meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/headsup/youthsports/index.html\" target=\"_new\">concussion in youth sports</a>.</p>",

She's one of the lead coordinators for the report.</p><p>Babies now can expect to live 78.6 years on average, based on 2017 data, according to NCHS researchers.</p><p>That's down from 78.7 years in 2015 and 78.9 years in 2014.</p><p>There were a total of 2.8 million U.S. deaths in 2017, almost 70,000 more than the previous year,the CDC reported.</p><p>\"We've been talking about the fact that our children will live less long than we will, and that's clearly coming to pass,\" said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.</p><p>Worse, it looks like the trend will continue for at least another year, said Benjamin, who wasn't involved with the research.</p><p>\"I always tell people one year is interesting, two years is more interesting, and three years is a trend,\" Benjamin said.</p><p>Final longevity numbers for 2014 through 2016 were published Sept. 20 in <i>Health, United States, 2017</i>, an annual report produced by the NCHS. The new numbers take that through 2017.</p><p>Life expectancy at birth decreased by 0.2 years between 2014 and 2015, which was the first drop seen since 1993. It then decreased another 0.1 years between 2015 and 2016.</p><p>The opioid epidemic likely plays a large role in the continuing decline, the researchers said, with a record 70,000 deaths linked to drug overdoses in 2017 alone.</p><p>The age-adjusted death rate for drug overdose in the United States increased 72 percent between 2006 and 2016, to stand at 19.8 by 2016. It then rose by another 9.6 percent in 2017, and now stands at nearly 22 deaths per 100,000. </p><p>There's also been a startling increase in the suicide rate. Between 2006 and 2017, the age-adjusted suicide death rate increased 23 percent, from 11 to 14 deaths per 100,000 people.</p><p>Suicides have been increasing in particular among military veterans and children, Benjamin said.</p><p>\"We don't understand all of the root causes of that, but we certainly are in a much more stressful society,\" Benjamin said. \"We have a huge population of people coming back from military service and [they] aren't necessarily getting the services they need to deal with mental health issues and traumatic brain injury.\"</p><p>Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis also appears to play a part in the decline in life expectancy.</p><p>Death rates for chronic liver disease increased by an average 7.9 percent per year between 2006 and 2016 among men aged 25 to 34, the report found. Among women in the same age group, this increase averaged 11.4 percent per year.</p><p>This could have been caused by a number of factors, including alcohol use or hepatitis infection, Gindi said.</p><p>The report also noted increases in the rates of death caused by Alzheimer's disease and septicemia, or blood poisoning.</p><p>For decades, life expectancy increased based on public health measures people now take for granted, Gindi said -- modern sewers, clean water, vaccines.</p><p>More recently, a focus on caring for chronic diseases kept life expectancy growing.</p><p>\"When we acknowledged that chronic diseases played a larger role, we were able to start preventing and diagnosing and treating these in ways we hadn't been able to before, particularly heart disease and cancer,\" Gindi said.</p><p>But gains in life expectancy due to advances against heart disease and cancer have been flattening, Benjamin said, while these other causes of death have been increasing.</p><p>\"People were predicting this would be because of the obesity epidemic,\" Benjamin said of the downward trend in life expectancy. \"Not to say that doesn't play a role, but suicides and drug overdoses have eclipsed that in many ways and it's really a driving factor.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/life-expectancy.htm\" target=\"_new\">life expectancy</a> in the United States.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 30, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- There's a good chance that some cases of the mysterious polio-like illness seen recently in U.S. children may have been misdiagnosed, a new study reports.</p><p>Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), which causes potentially life-threatening paralysis and primarily strikes children, has been recurring in the United States in every-other-year waves since 2014.</p><p>But it's likely some kids diagnosed with AFM actually have some other neurological disorder. And it's an equally good possibility that some true cases of AFM are being missed, said Dr. Matthew Elrick, a pediatric neurologist with Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.</p><p>\"This is a challenging diagnosis,\" said study lead researcher Elrick. \"There is overlap with other diseases.\"</p><p>His team reviewed 45 children who met the broad federal definition of AFM, and found that 11 were actually suffering from other neurological illnesses.</p><p>Elrick and his colleagues believe they've identified specific symptoms that more clearly indicate AFM, based on the group of kids they studied.</p><p>It's important to come up with a more precise definition because AFM is \"a major public health concern that we really need to focus on,\" Elrick said.</p><p>So far in 2018, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 116 cases of AFM out of a total 286 reports under investigation. These cases have occurred in 31 U.S. states.</p><p>This is the third wave of AFM to strike the United States, and it's expected to be the largest on record.</p><p>AFM first appeared in 2014, when 120 children across 34 states were stricken with mysterious muscle weakness.</p><p>Another wave hit in 2016, with 149 patients affected in 39 states.</p><p>\"During the first outbreak in 2014, it was sort of a curiosity we hoped was a one-time thing, but it's now established a pattern, coming back in 2016 and 2018 with higher numbers each time,\" Elrick said. \"There's plenty of reason to be concerned that there could be another outbreak in 2020 and beyond.\"</p><p>The new study, published Nov. 30 in the journal <i>JAMA Pediatrics</i>, found that children with definite AFM share several characteristics:</p><ul><li>All of the kids with more restrictively defined AFM had a viral infection that preceded their weakness.</li><li>These children all shared similar readings on MRI scans, spinal fluid tests and electromyography (a test of the electrical activity of muscle tissue).</li><li>All of the kids had a pattern of muscle weakness indicating damage to the lower motor neurons, which are nerve cells in the spinal cord that initiate muscle contraction.</li></ul><p>\"They were not only weak but also their muscle tone was decreased and their reflexes were decreased or absent,\" Elrick said.</p><p>A couple of other symptoms could indicate AFM but are not conclusive, the researchers added.</p><p>Nearly every case of AFM starts out asymmetrically, with one side of the body more affected than the other, Elrick said. But this can't be used to rule out AFM in a child with symmetric muscle weakness.</p><p>Timing also could be important. \"The symptoms come on relatively suddenly but then gradually progress over the course of hours to days, where some of the other cases have this really rapid onset,\" Elrick said.</p><p>On the other hand, there are some symptoms that should prompt doctors to consider diagnoses other than AFM, the researchers said.</p><p>For example, kids with AFM do not typically lose feeling or sensation alongside their paralysis. They tend to be awake and alert, and MRI scans do not show any signs of lesions or damage to the brain, Elrick said.</p><p>\"I wouldn't necessarily say that a child who does not meet these criteria in the hospital absolutely does not have AFM, but it would at least make me pause and go back and reconsider alternative diagnoses,\" Elrick said.</p><p>The CDC set a broad case definition for AFM, so the agency's epidemiologists could gather as many potential cases as possible for evaluation, Elrick said. Out of those, a smaller number will be confirmed.</p><p>But when it comes to finding a treatment or cure for AFM, researchers will need to be much more precise when they select patients to study, Elrick said. That way, they will know they are working with someone who has the actual disease.</p><p>\"This is a step forward for how you define these patients in a research setting, but also provides some guidance in a clinical setting,\" Elrick said.</p><p>It is indeed very possible that some AFM cases are being misdiagnosed, said Dr. Riley Bove, a neurologist with the University of California, San Francisco.</p><p>\"I know sometimes presentations in children can overlap. Several different types of conditions can cause injury to the spinal cord,\" said Bove, who wrote a perspective piece that accompanied Elrick's study.</p><p>Bove's son, 8-year-old Luca, developed AFM during the first wave in 2014, and he shares the characteristics identified by Elrick's research team.</p><p>The boy fell ill with a virus that went through his home and his school, and recovered from it, Bove said.</p><p>\"About 10 days later he woke up and his head fell back, and he said he was dizzy and couldn't sit up straight,\" Bove said. \"Over the course of the day, his neck and right arm paralyzed.\"</p><p>He further worsened over the next week, losing all muscle function from his face down. At one point, Luca's paralysis became so dire he needed assistance with breathing and feeding, Bove said.</p><p>The boy walked out of rehab \"very floppy and weak\" two months later, Bove said.</p><p>\"He still has patchy weakness in most parts of his body, especially his right arm and neck and shoulder,\" Bove said. \"He's had to learn how to write left-handed. He has that classic floppy, skinny, short little limb with polio.\"</p><p>Still, worried parents should keep in mind that this is \"really, really rare,\" Bove said.</p><p>But since it's a rare condition, parents should be prepared to push their doctors hard if their child develops muscle weakness following a viral infection, she added.</p><p>\"Parents really have to be advocates here, because the condition is rare and there's poor awareness of it,\" Bove said. \"If a parent does notice unusual symptoms in their kid, be really persistent about having those evaluated.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about <a href=\" https://www.cdc.gov/acute-flaccid-myelitis/index.html\" target=\"_new\">acute flaccid myelitis</a>.</p>",

Kids between the ages of 5 and 9, and boys in general, have higher injury rates and may need more supervision when using the equipment.</p><p>When choosing a playground to take your kids to, pick those that are surfaced with shock-absorbing material, such as hardwood mulch or sand. Make sure your kids use only equipment appropriate for their age, with guardrails to help prevent falls, and that the equipment is in good condition. Also, check the play area for any tripping hazards, like rocks or tree stumps.</p><p>Since accidents do happen, also know the signs of a traumatic brain injury.</p><p>TBI Signs in Kids:</p><ul><li>Appears confused or dazed.</li> <li>Moves clumsily.</li><li>Is slow to respond to questions.</li> <li>Loses consciousness, even briefly.</li> <li>Shows mood, behavior or personality changes.</li> <li>Can't recall what happened before or after the fall.</li></ul><p><b>More information</b></p><p>See how your state's playgrounds stack up from a safety point-of-view by checking out the <a href=\"http://www.playgroundsafety.org/research/state-report-cards\" target=\"_new\">playground scorecard</a> from the National Program for Playground Safety.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 29, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Have you ever wondered why hair grows on some parts of your body, but not others?</p> <p>New research offers a possible explanation. Scientists found that hairless skin secretes a protein that blocks a signaling pathway (WNT) that controls hair growth.</p><p>Called Dickkopf 2 (DKK2), the protein is found in specific embryonic and adult tissues and has a variety of functions, the University of Pennsylvania researchers explained.</p><p>They found that plantar skin from mice -- similar to the underside of the human wrist -- had high levels of DKK2. When they genetically removed DKK2 from the mice, hair began to grow in this normally hairless skin region.</p><p>\"This is significant because it tells us WNT is still present in hairless regions, it's just being blocked,\" said study co-senior author Sarah Millar, director of the Penn Skin Biology and Diseases Resource-Based Center.</p><p>\"We know that WNT signaling is critical for the development of hair follicles; blocking it causes hairless skin, and switching it on causes formation of more hair,\" Millar said in a Penn news release.</p><p>\"In this study, we've shown the skin in hairless regions naturally produces an inhibitor that stops WNT from doing its job,\" she added.</p><p>Hair follicles develop before birth. This means that hair follicles don't regrow after severe burns or deep wounds. The researchers are currently investigating whether secreted WNT inhibitors suppress hair follicle development in such cases.</p><p>More than 80 million people in the United States have male- or female-pattern baldness, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. Previous research suggests that DKK2 may be associated with this condition, meaning it could be a potential target for treatment.</p><p>\"We hope that these lines of investigation will reveal new ways to improve wound healing and hair growth, and we plan to continue to pursue these goals moving forward,\" Millar said.</p><p>The study was published Nov. 28 in the journal <i>Cell Reports</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Dermatology has more on <a href=\"https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/hair-and-scalp-problems/hair-loss\" target=\"_new\">hair loss</a>.</p>",

They found that 8 percent had moderate or severe depression and another 5 percent had attempted suicide or thought about it.</p><p>An additional 22 percent of teens scored high enough to suggest a risk for depressive symptoms, the researchers said.</p><p>The rate of depression in the general population is less than 8 percent, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Abnormal brain activity in people with epilepsy causes seizures or periods of unusual sensations.</p><p>\"We know that depression is more common in people with epilepsy compared to the general population, but there is less information about depression in children and teens than adults,\" said lead author Hillary Thomas, a psychologist at Children's Health System in Dallas.</p><p>Also, little is known about the factors that increase the likelihood of depressive symptoms, Thomas said in a news release from the American Epilepsy Society.</p><p>\"Depression screening should be routine at epilepsy treatment centers and can identify children and teens who would benefit from intervention,\" she added.</p><p>Study senior author Dr. Susan Arnold is director of the Pediatric Epilepsy Center at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.

Researchers found that 52 percent who'd experienced a health crisis, such as an emergency room visit or accident, had moderate or severe depression.</p><p>That study also found that adult epilepsy patients with depression may have other mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder or panic disorder. They too should be screened, the researchers said.</p><p>\"People with epilepsy who have depression are more likely to have seizures, so treating the depression doesn't just help with depression, but also with the epilepsy,\" said Dr. Martha Sajatovic, lead author of the adult study. She's director of neurological outcomes at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland.</p><p>\"Identifying people with epilepsy who have depression or other mental health issues is half of the battle,\" Sajatovic said. \"Following up to ensure they receive treatment is vital, because it can truly change patient outcomes and help them achieve their best quality of life.\"</p><p>For example, the researchers found that severely depressed epilepsy patients are less likely to work.</p><p>Those who are identified with mental health issues should get treatment such as cognitive behavioral therapy and medication, said Sajatovic. </p><p>The studies were scheduled for presentation Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Epilepsy Society, in New Orleans.

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Dec. 7, 2018 (American Heart Association) -- Jasmine Johnson has become reacquainted with the South Dallas neighborhood where she grew up. Much is familiar, but she's noticed there aren't many places that sell fresh food.</p> <p>The 29-year-old filmmaker is determined to bring attention to the issue for a community riddled with diabetes, high blood pressure and other chronic diseases. She said the short film she's making about the impact poor nutrition has on the health of people in that area is her way of giving back to the black community where her family's roots and civic contributions run deep.</p> <p>\"There are people that are struggling. There are people that are hurting,\" said Johnson. \"There are people that need more attention than they are getting.\"</p> <p>Johnson said she knew her friend Carlita Wilson was the right person to team up with for the project. The women's proposal won first place in a competition sponsored this summer by the American Heart Association's EmPowered to Serve initiative, a program that promotes heart disease and stroke awareness in black communities. The film doesn't have a release date yet. </p> <p>Wilson grew up in Chicago's South Side, a largely black community and an area that is known for crime problems and poverty. The freelance script writer from Arlington, Texas, said her childhood neighborhood and South Dallas share many bad nutritional traits.</p> <p>\"There was always fried chicken, fried fish options on every corner,\" said Wilson, 37. \"There were plenty of liquor stores, plenty of places that you can buy things that we didn't necessarily need or weren't healthy. There weren't fresh food options hardly anywhere.\"</p> <p>Black adults are more likely than white adults to suffer from high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity and other conditions that cause or increase the risk for heart disease and stroke. They're also more likely to die from heart disease and stroke compared to other racial and ethnic groups.</p> <p>Both women know firsthand that poor eating habits can take a serious toll on health.</p> <p>Johnson's mother has had three strokes over the past eight years. She also has uncontrolled high blood pressure. Johnson attributes her mother's health problems to many years of pizzas, chicken nuggets, hamburgers and other fast food. </p> <p>Her father has diabetes, and last year, Johnson's doctor told her she was prediabetic. Johnson said she so rarely ate fruits and vegetables growing up that she considered them a treat.</p> <p>Wilson's parents have similar struggles with diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease. Although the family regularly ate home-cooked meals, their diet was short on fruits and healthier vegetables. </p> <p>Their loved ones' health scares -- and their own -- made the pair determined to take better care of themselves and their families. </p> <p>Johnson said she's cooking more and has inspired her family to eat healthier meals, and cooks regularly for her parents. She's gotten some of her cousins to try her kale shakes. </p> <p>\"If there's a will, there's a way,\" said Johnson. \"Not on my watch will they die because of the poor nutrition.\"</p> <p>Wilson, who has a 12-year-old son, said she's learned to put a healthy twist on the soul food meals of her childhood she now cooks for her family. Getting her boyfriend and his son to eat more fruits and vegetables is an ongoing project, she said.</p> <p>The women hope the film resonates beyond Dallas in other black communities where many people don't eat right in part because they're struggling to make ends meet. They want their project to inspire people in those cities and towns to take charge of their nutrition to get healthy.</p> <p>\"You can be proactive. You don't have to get heart disease, you don't have to become diabetic,\" Wilson said. \"I do believe change can happen.\"</p>",

Finding these mutations early may lead to helping newborns live better lives and ease the worries of their families. </p><p>For the study, Green and his colleagues randomly assigned 128 healthy newborns and 31 ill infants to have their DNA sequenced.</p><p>Among all the babies, 9.4 percent had a gene mutation that increased the risk of a disorder that arises or is manageable during childhood, or a mutation that conferred a moderate risk for a condition for which treatment during childhood might prevent devastating outcomes later in life.</p><p>Mutations included those linked to several heart conditions that affect how the heart functions, according to the report. These conditions can be monitored, and families have been referred to cardiac specialists.</p><p>One newborn had a risk for biotin deficiency, which can lead to skin rash, hair loss and seizures. That child's diet is now being supplemented with biotin, which should prevent any symptoms, the researchers said.</p><p> Senior study author Alan Beggs explained that \"sequencing results have potential to raise questions that may be upsetting for parents, but could also lead to helpful or even lifesaving interventions.\" Beggs is director of The Manton Center of Orphan Disease Research at Boston Children's Hospital. </p><p>\"Only time will tell how the costs -- both financial and in terms of extra medical testing and family stress -- balance out against the benefits.

Many studies over the past 15 years have found a greater risk of birth defects in babies whose mothers drank well water with concentrations of certain contaminants.</p><p>You can't rely on how your water looks coming out of the faucet to evaluate its safety. That's because dangerous contaminants don't always affect color or smell. One example is nitrate, a chemical found in many fertilizers that can leech into the water table.

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Dec. 5, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Checking for low hemoglobin in the blood -- otherwise known as anemia -- usually means drawing blood for testing.</p><p>But scientists say they've developed a wireless smartphone app that does the same by \"reading\" a quick photo of your fingernail.</p><p>The app converts fingernail colors into quick readings of blood hemoglobin levels, according to researchers at Emory University in Atlanta. They said the technology could be used by anyone at any time, but its use right now is  limited to screening, not a formal diagnosis of anemia.</p><p>Anemia is a blood condition affecting 2 billion people worldwide. If untreated, it can lead to fatigue, paleness and heart problems.</p><p>Typical methods of screening for anemia \"require external equipment, and represent trade-offs between invasiveness, cost and accuracy,\" lead researcher Dr. Wilbur Lam, associate professor of pediatrics, explained in an Emory news release.</p><p>But the new app has an accuracy that's \"on par with currently available point-of-care tests,  without the need to draw blood,\" Lam said.</p><p>The investigators believe the app could be useful for screening pregnant women, women with abnormal menstrual bleeding, or runners and other athletes. Its simplicity also means it could help people in developing countries.</p><p>The app could be available for download as soon as spring 2019, the researchers said.</p><p>One member of the development team, Rob Mannino, had a personal stake in the technology's success. The former biomedical engineering graduate student has an inherited blood disorder called beta-thalassemia.</p><p>\"Treatment for my disease requires monthly blood transfusions,\" Mannino explained in the news release. \"My doctors would test my hemoglobin levels more if they could, but it's a hassle for me to get to the hospital in between transfusions to receive this blood test. Instead, my doctors currently have to just estimate when I'm going to need a transfusion, based on my hemoglobin level trends.\"</p><p>In the new study, published Dec. 4 in <i>Nature Communications</i>, Lam's team used data on 237 people -- some anemic, some not -- to develop an algorithm that converted fingernail color to represent blood hemoglobin levels.</p><p>It was then tested on 100 patients and proved highly accurate in people with both dark and light skin tones, the research team said. That's because the nail bed does not contain melanin, which gives skin its color.</p><p>The app should enable patients with chronic anemia to monitor themselves to know when they need to adjust their therapies or receive transfusions. This could reduce side effects or complications of having transfusions too early or too late, Lam's team said.</p><p>Mannino's experience proved integral to the research.</p><p>\"This whole project couldn't have been done by anyone but Rob,\" Lam said. \"He took pictures of himself before and after transfusions as his hemoglobin levels were changing, which enabled him to constantly refine and tweak his technology on himself in a very efficient manner. So essentially, he was his own perfect initial test subject with each iteration of the app.\"</p><p>One doctor who often treats anemia in children was optimistic about the new technology, with one caveat.</p><p>Dr. Michael Grosso directs pediatrics at Huntington Hospital in Huntington, N.Y. He agreed that \"the availability of a rapid, accurate and non-invasive anemia screening test could have significant benefits.\"</p><p>But he was concerned that the app might miss more subtle forms of anemia.</p><p>\"It turns out that mild iron deficiency can affect the body without triggering anemia, and children in that situation would be missed by the non-invasive test,\" Grosso said. \"So, the smartphone test definitely falls short of the tried-and-true blood count, but it is better than no test at all.\"</p><p>For their part, Lam and colleagues said further research, conducted with a variety of patient types, is ongoing. That means the app's sensitivity and accuracy should improve with time.</p><p>\"This is just a snapshot of the accuracy right now,\" Lam said. \"The algorithm gets smarter with every patient enrolled.\"</p><p>The research was funded in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Lam and Mannino have filed a patent application for the anemia app, and will have financial interest in its success.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has more on <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/anemia\" target=\"_new\">anemia</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Dec. 5, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- For certain women with early stage breast cancer, a newer drug that combines an antibody with chemotherapy may cut the risk of disease recurrence in half, a new trial finds.</p><p>The study focused on nearly 1,500 women with early stage breast cancer that was HER2-positive -- meaning it carries a protein that promotes cancer growth.</p><p>About one in every five breast cancers is HER2-positive.</p><p>All of the women in the new trial had undergone a standard treatment scenario. First, they received traditional chemotherapy and the drug Herceptin (trastuzumab) -- an antibody that targets HER2-positive cancer cells. Then they had surgery to remove any remaining cancer.</p><p>Often, women find out that the chemo-Herceptin therapy has already wiped out the cancer, explained Dr. Charles Geyer, the lead researcher on the new study.</p><p>But for many other women, there is still \"residual\" cancer at the time of surgery. And they have a relatively higher risk of seeing their cancer come back, said Geyer, a professor of medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond.</p><p>All of the women in his study fell into that category.</p><p>Right now, the standard of care is to keep those patients on Herceptin for another year after surgery. Geyer's team wanted to know if women might fare better on a different drug, Kadcyla.</p><p>Kadcyla is a newer drug that combines Herceptin with a chemotherapy drug called emtansine. In the United States, it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating some women with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer.</p><p>Geyer explained the basics of how the drug works: \"The chemotherapy is attached to the antibody. The idea is that the antibody will carry the chemo directly into the cells that you want to hit.\"</p><p>Geyer and his colleagues reasoned that Kadcyla might be more effective than Herceptin at preventing recurrences in their early stage patients.</p><p>\"It turned out that hypothesis was correct,\" he said.</p><p>Of women who received the drug for a year after surgery, 88 percent were alive and cancer-free three years later. That compared with 77 percent of those given Herceptin.</p><p>\"That difference is quite substantial,\" said Dr. Eric Winer, a medical oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.</p><p>Winer, who was not involved in the research, said the findings will probably \"change practice in the short term.\"</p><p>Kadcyla is not yet approved to treat patients like those in this trial. But doctors are free to use FDA-approved drugs for reasons other than their official indication -- though insurers have to agree to pay.</p><p>Winer said that with this new evidence, \"it's likely\" insurers will pay for Kadcyla in cases like these.</p><p>When it was approved in 2013, the drug's cost was more than $90,000 for a typical course of treatment -- about double the price of Herceptin.</p><p>Geyer was scheduled to present the findings Wednesday at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. The study was published simultaneously online in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>. </p><p>The research was funded by Kadcyla maker F. Hoffmann La Roche/Genentech. Geyer is an unpaid member of the company's breast cancer advisory boards.</p> <p>The study involved 1,486 women with early stage cancer who still had tumor tissue left after standard chemotherapy and Herceptin. Following surgery, they were randomly assigned to receive either Kadcyla or Herceptin for about a year. Both drugs are given by infusion, every three weeks.</p><p>The women were followed for three years after their treatment. At that point, about 12 percent of Kadcyla patients had suffered a recurrence or died, versus 22 percent of Herceptin patients.</p><p>However, there were more side effects with Kadcyla, Geyer said. They included a drop in blood platelets -- cells that help the blood clot -- plus nerve symptoms such as numbness, and elevations in liver enzymes.</p><p>But the majority, according to Geyer, were at the milder \"grade 1 or 2\" level.</p><p>Winer framed the findings within a bigger picture: Over the past two decades, treatment advances -- including Herceptin and similar drugs -- have allowed more and more women with HER2-positive breast cancer to fare well.</p><p>\"This study is another step in the direction of preventing more recurrences,\" he said. \"It's exciting.\"</p><p>Geyer agreed. \"Women with HER2-positive cancer generally have a very favorable outlook,\" he said. \"The group having recurrences is getting smaller and smaller.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Cancer Society has more on <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/understanding-a-breast-cancer-diagnosis/breast-cancer-her2-status.html\" target=\"_new\">HER2-positive breast cancer</a>.</p>",

Whether you're trying to drop pounds or stay at a healthy weight, some adjustments will let you  keep it on the menu.</p><p>Rice belongs to the grain family. While grains are an important part of your overall diet, standard white rice isn't a nutritious choice -- it's not a whole grain. What's more, it's a food that has 200 calories per cup, so you want to make sure that you maximize nutrients as well as flavor.</p><p>First, opt for brown rice, the whole-grain form, as often as possible. White rice has gone through a process that removes its fiber and many of its nutrients, including protein, iron and some B vitamins.</p><p>There are many types -- and colors -- of whole grain rice to sample, including brown basmati, red rice, purple Thai and Chinese black rice.  Popular Wehani rice is a whole grain, reddish-brown American hybrid of basmati and brown rices. Note that wild rice is another tasty choice, though technically it's not a rice, but rather a semi-aquatic grass. It makes a great medley when mixed with brown rice.</p><p>Also experiment with different ways to turn rice into a meal rather than a side dish. For lunch or a cold supper, load a whole-wheat pita pocket with cooked and cooled rice and chopped vegetables and top with a light vinaigrette.</p><p>Or try a cold rice salad for a to-go meal. For your protein, add in chunks of turkey, chicken, tofu or nuts, then blend in a handful of dried raisins or cranberries and a sprinkling of seasonings.</p> <p>You can even get creative and make homemade sushi rolls at home. Use avocado and cucumber if you're not a fan of raw fish.</p><p>Baked with milk, eggs, vanilla, a small amount of sweetener and cinnamon, brown rice can even make a healthy version of rice pudding for dessert or even breakfast.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Whole Grains Council has more on all types of <a href=\"https://wholegrainscouncil.org/whole-grains-101/easy-ways-enjoy-whole-grains/grain-month-calendar/wild-rice-september-grain-month-0\" target=\"_new\">rice</a> to help you enjoy the healthiest varieties.</p>",

A Western Colorado University study sponsored by the American Council on Exercise (ACE) tested the variables and found definitive results.</p><p>First, on days when you're doing cardio, you should typically start with this workout, whatever aerobic activity you choose. You'll not only get the maximum benefits by doing it first, but you'll also warm up your body for the second exercise.</p><p>If strength training is also part of that day's plan, do it next. If you're piggy-backing all types of exercise, flexibility and motor skills should follow strength training, in whatever order you like.</p><p>The research found that this sequence had psychological as well as physical benefits.</p><p>However, experts add that it's fine to personalize these findings based on individual goals. For instance, if you need to focus on one type of exercise in particular, like flexibility to help with low back pain, start a multi-discipline session with that workout so that you're fresh when doing it. Or if building muscle is your top goal, start with strength training.</p><p>Another approach is to devote certain days of the week to your primary area of focus, and then double or triple up on the other fitness disciplines on different days. Here are two sample plans.</p><p>Plan A:</p><ul><li>Monday and Thursday: Strength-training.</li><li>Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday: Cardio, flexibility and motor skills.</li><li>Sunday: Swimming laps at a community pool.</li></ul><p>Plan B:</p><ul><li>Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday: Cardio.</li><li>Wednesday and Saturday: Strength-training, flexibility and motor skills.</li><li>Sunday: Family cycling trip.</li></ul><p>As you progress in one area, it's easy to move around the various exercise blocks to suit your changing needs.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Read more about the sequencing study along with additional ways to <a href=\"https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/professional/prosource/research-special-issue-2015/5322/ace-research-study-sequencing-exercise-for-optimum-results\" target=\"_new\">optimize exercise results</a> on the ACE website.</p>",

Spending a lot of time sitting leads to shortened hip flexors, the muscles on the front of the hip. This forces the lower back to do more of the work during a golf swing, resulting in pain.</p><p>\"Proactive physical therapy can diagnose this imbalance and improve hip mobility,\" Plafcan said. \"The result is less risk of back pain, plus a more powerful downswing and greater yardage on the golf course.\"</p><p>He also said that one-sided body use in many sports leads to physical imbalance.</p><p>\"A baseball player, tennis player or golfer constantly works one side of the body more than the other, depending on whether the athlete is right-handed or left-handed,\" Plafcan said.</p><p>\"Yes, these athletes need great strength on their dominant sides to excel in their sport, but weakness on the other side of the body can lead to overcompensation and injury,\" he explained. \"By targeting exercise to increase symmetry in strength and flexibility, the athlete can improve overall performance.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons offers <a href=\"https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/staying-healthy/\" target=\"_new\">sports injury prevention tips</a>.</p>",

While some patients recover without treatment, others suffer damage to lungs, heart, lymph nodes, skin and other organs. On the skin, it can cause disfiguring lesions.</p><p>The disease \"alters the immune system which, in turn, leads to increased inflammation in the body,\" explained Dr. Anup Singh, a pulmonologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>\"This increased inflammation may cause non-specific symptoms like cough, weight loss, rash, joint pain and swelling, palpitations, difficulty in breathing, headache or loss of vision,\"  said Singh, who wasn't involved in the new study.</p><p>The new research was led by Dr. Nkiruka Emeagwali, a clinical fellow at Yale Medical School.  She said current treatments for sarcoidosis include steroids or the anti-inflammatory drug known as methotrexate. Neither are reliably effective, however, and both can cause serious side effects, the researchers noted.</p><p>The Yale team suspected -- based on data from earlier trials -- that the rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz might help.  It belongs to a class of medicines called JAK inhibitors, because the drugs act on a specific biochemical pathway called Jak-STAT.</p><p>Researchers had already used this class of drug to successfully treat other chronic skin diseases such as vitiligo, alopecia areata and eczema.</p><p>In the new study, a 48-year-old woman with sarcoidosis took Xeljanz twice a day over several months. Over that time, her skin lesions nearly disappeared, the Yale team reported in the Dec. 27 issue of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p>\"During treatment, not only does her skin disease go away, but there is no activation of the pathway,\" researcher Dr. Nkiruka Emeagwali, a clinical fellow at Yale Medical School, said in a Yale news release.</p><p>In addition, the researchers looked at genetic data from another patient before and during treatment, which proved that the Jak-STAT pathway was involved.</p><p>\"We plan to evaluate the activation of the Jak-STAT pathway in the lung fluid and blood of over 200 patients with pulmonary and multiorgan sarcoidosis,\" she said.</p><p>The findings are being tested further in a clinical trial. If confirmed, they could represent a breakthrough for sarcoidosis patients, the researchers said.</p><p>\"A frequently awful disease, which to date has no reliably effective therapy, may now be targeted with Jak inhibitors,\" said lead researcher Dr. Brett King, an associate professor of dermatology at Yale. \"We have a relatively safe medicine that works.\"</p><p>Singh noted that the patient had exhausted many avenues for treatment.</p><p>She \"had been treated with multiple anti-inflammatory drugs including oral steroids and methotrexate for eight years -- without any improvement of symptoms,\" he said.</p><p>Her success in eliminating sarcoidosis symptoms while taking Xeljanz \"suggests that there is a different pathway of our immune system which is also involved in inflammation seen in patients of sarcoidosis,\" Singh said.</p><p>But he stressed that more study is crucial before the drug becomes a first-line treatment.</p><p>\"This case report has given us hope for a newer treatment alternative in the form of tofacitinib,\" Singh said, but the drug \"will remain an investigational option, until results of future studies are available.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more information on sarcoidosis, visit the <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/sarcoidosis\" target=\"_new\"> U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</a>.</p>",

Then have them apologize,\" said study author Craig Smith, a research investigator at the university's Center for Human Growth and Development.</p><p>In the study, Smith's team looked at how children viewed three types of apology scenarios among peers: unprompted apologies, prompted but willingly given apologies, and coerced apologies.</p>  <p>While kids viewed willing apologies the same, whether prompted or unprompted by adults, the coerced apologies weren't seen as effective, especially by the 7- to 9-year-olds, Smith noted.</p><p>Children of all ages thought the victims felt better after receiving a willing apology, but they saw the recipient of the forced apology as feeling worse than the recipients of the willing apologies.</p><p>\"Coercing your child to apologize is going to backfire. Other kids don't view that apologizer as likable. The teachable element of having the child apologize has gone away and the goal of the apology prompt -- to help your child express remorse, soothe someone else's hurt feelings and make your child more likable -- is lost,\" Smith explained in a university news release.</p><p>The study was published online recently in the <i>Merrill-Palmer Quarterly</i> journal.</p><p>Smith outlined how parents can help children respond with empathy after they've upset another person.</p><p>\"When your child is calm, help them see how the other person is feeling, and why,\" he said. \"An apology is one way to do it, but there are lots of ways.

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Dec. 5, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- With so much emphasis on fresh, farm-to-table foods, it's easy to overlook the value of canned items. These are convenient, often cheaper alternatives to fresh and frozen.</p><p>Use these tips to help you choose wisely.</p><p>When shopping, look for cans in good shape. Don't buy -- or keep -- cans that are dented, rusted or swollen. Cans have a packing code for tracking them through interstate commerce, but these numbers have nothing to do with their freshness. Look for a \"best if used by\" date for peak quality.</p><p>Canned foods are safe indefinitely as long as they're not exposed to either freezing temperatures or temperatures above 90 degrees. But foods with high acidity, like tomatoes and fruits, taste best if eaten within 12 to 18 months.</p><p>With such a long shelf-life, you can stock up when favorite foods go on sale, especially time-savers like canned beans, which are ready to use. Be sure that you're getting plain cooked beans, not with the added sugar and other ingredients of baked beans, for instance.</p><p>Now for the cautions.</p><p>Watch the salt. Salt, or sodium, is often used as a preservative, but you can shop for low- or reduced-sodium or no-salt-added varieties. Compare the sodium content of different brands on their nutrition labels and choose foods with the lowest amount. You can also drain and rinse canned food to reduce salt.</p><p>Watch the sugar. Again, read the ingredients list and avoid foods with added sugar. Compare the sugar content of different brands on the nutrition labels and choose foods with the lowest amount. When buying canned fruit, look for products that are canned in water or its own juice. If you have no choice, drain and rinse any foods packed in syrup.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln has more tips on <a href=\"https://food.unl.edu/healthy-bites-february-national-canned-food-month\" target=\"_new\">buying, storing and eating</a> canned foods.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 6, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Even with the same treatment, black women with the most common form of breast cancer experience higher recurrence and death rates than white women, a new trial reveals.</p><p>The finding pokes holes in the prevailing notion that black women with breast cancer fare worse due to less access to quality medical care, experts said. While that factor may contribute to poorer outcomes, other factors -- such as the way drugs are metabolized based on race -- may be at play.</p><p>\"Going way back, there's always been the concern about blacks in terms of cancer outcomes over time, but a lot of that was based on population [studies] where treatment wasn't controlled,\" said study author Dr. Kathy Albain. She's chair of oncology research at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine.</p><p>But \"leveling the playing field by bringing women to the same doctors and getting the same treatment\" didn't equalize breast cancer outcomes between black and white women, Albain added.</p>  <p>More than 250,000 women in the United States were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in 2017, according to the American Cancer Society. The disease claims the lives of about 40,000 people each year.</p> <p>Albain and her colleagues evaluated the link between clinical outcomes and race in more than 10,000 women with early stage hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, the most common type of the disease.</p><p>Findings from the same multinational research, known as the TAILORx trial, were released in June showing that most women with early breast cancer don't benefit from chemotherapy. Treating them with chemotherapy and hormone therapy after surgery doesn't improve outcomes more than hormone therapy alone.</p>  <p>In this latest analysis, patients' tumors were analyzed using a molecular test that looks at the expression of 21 genes associated with breast cancer recurrence. About 84 percent of the patients were white, 7 percent were black, 4 percent Asian and 4 percent were of other or unknown race. Ethnically, 79 percent were non-Hispanic, 9 percent were Hispanic and 12 percent were of unknown ethnicity.</p><p>The types, use and length of treatments were similar between both black and white patients and between Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients.</p><p>But outcomes were significantly different: Black women experienced a 39 percent higher risk of breast cancer recurrence compared to white women and a 52 percent higher risk of dying.</p><p>These marked outcome disparities were not explained by reported adherence to therapy, or by factors such as age or tumor size or aggression level, Albain said. But she said it's possible that differences in the way racial groups metabolize drugs could play a role.</p> <p>\"We inherit genes from our parents and the genes that metabolize drugs &hellip; differ,\" Albain said. \"It's not any sort of racial bias, it's just a fact.\"</p><p>Also, because hormone therapy pill adherence was self-reported, she noted, the study authors don't know if black and white patients actually took the pills according to directions, or in the same way.</p><p>\"Patients will tell me all the time they're taking their pills, and they're not taking their pills,\" Albain said. \"Pill-counting wasn't done in this trial\" to confirm what patients reported.</p><p>Dr. Ann Partridge is a breast medical oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and wasn't involved in the new research. But she said she wasn't surprised by the findings and agreed that black and white patients in the study may have adhered to hormonal pill therapy differently.</p><p>\"We know that young people and African-Americans are less adherent with hormonal therapy -- that's been shown over and over again,\" she said.</p> <p>Partridge also noted that exercise behaviors have been shown to differ by race, and that white women tend to exercise more than black women, which could \"have a profound impact\" on cancer outcomes.</p><p>\"This is also true for obesity and diet &hellip; which also tends to be different by race,\" added Partridge, who's also a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.</p> <p>Albain and Partridge agreed that more research is needed to pinpoint all the reasons breast cancer outcomes differ according to race.</p> <p>\"We have to chip away at it all, increase our understanding of disease differences and not lump [factors together] as much as we do,\" Partridge said.</p><p>The research is to be presented Thursday at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in Texas. Research presented at scientific conferences typically hasn't been peer-reviewed or published, and results are considered preliminary.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Cancer Institute offers more information on <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/patient/breast-treatment-pdq\" target=\"_new\">breast cancer treatment</a>.</p>",

About 56 percent said they smoked only factory-made cigarettes, while nearly 37 percent said they smoked only roll-your-own cigarettes.</p><p>Just 16 percent of roll-your-own smokers were highly motivated to quit, compared to 20 percent of factory-made cigarette smokers, according to the University College London (UCL) study. It was published online Dec. 4 in the journal <i>BMJ Open</i>.</p><p>Why the difference? Roll-your-own smokers were less interested in quitting because of the cheaper cost of their cigarettes, the study found. Only factory-made cigarettes are taxed, the researchers explained.</p><p>\"Cost is consistently reported by smokers as one of the primary motives for quitting. With [roll-your-own] cigarettes offering a lower cost alternative to factory-made cigarettes, [roll-your-own] users may be more able to afford to continue to smoke, and therefore less inclined to try to quit,\" said study author Sarah Jackson, from the Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care at UCL.</p><p>\"This has important implications for tobacco control policy, given that a key strategy used by governments worldwide to reduce smoking is to raise taxes on tobacco in order to increase the cost of smoking,\" Jackson said in a university news release.</p><p>Kruti Shrotri, Cancer Research UK's tobacco control expert, agreed. The group funded the research.</p><p>\"[Roll-your-own] cigarettes are much cheaper, so it's not surprising that smokers using these cigarettes are less motivated to quit than those using factory-made ones,\" Shrotri said.</p><p> \"But it's important to know that there's no safe way to use tobacco. The [British] Government needs to increase taxes on rolling tobacco to match the prices of factory-made cigarettes to help motivate smokers to quit, whatever type of tobacco they use,\" she added.</p><p>\"Smoking is the single biggest cause of cancer, preventable illness and avoidable death,\" Shrotri said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Cancer Society has more on <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/healthy/stay-away-from-tobacco/guide-quitting-smoking/deciding-to-quit-smoking-and-making-a-plan.html\" target=\"_new\">quitting smoking</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 6, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Tamoxifen is considered a vital weapon in the fight against breast cancer, but many women who have to take the drug struggle with its significant side effects.</p><p>Now, new research shows that a lower dose of the hormone therapy helped prevent breast cancer from returning and guarded against new cancers in women who had high-risk breast tissue.</p><p>On top of that, the lower dose -- just 5 milligrams daily -- came with fewer troubling side effects.</p><p>\"Low-dose tamoxifen is as effective as the standard dose,\" said study author Dr. Andrea De Censi. He is director of the medical oncology unit at the National Hospital E.O. Ospedali Galliera -- S.C. Oncologia Medica in Genoa, Italy. </p><p>De Censi said the rate of side effects -- such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, pain during intercourse and muscle pain -- was similar to the rate that occurred with a placebo pill. The side effect rate for the low-dose therapy was significantly less than what previous research has shown with the standard 20 milligram (mg) dose of tamoxifen, he noted. </p><p>In addition, the risk of serious side effects, such as blood clots and endometrial cancer, were similar to that of the placebo, and less than what typically occurs with the 20 mg dose, De Censi said. </p><p>Hormone therapy for breast cancer interferes with the growth of cancer cells in a few ways. One is by blocking the body from producing certain hormones. Another is by disrupting the effects of certain hormones on cancer cells, according to the American Cancer Society. </p><p>In the case of tamoxifen, it works by binding to estrogen-receptors. Some cancers -- those called estrogen-receptor positive -- are fueled by estrogen. Tamoxifen blocks the estrogen-receptors on cancer cells, keeping them from getting the fuel they need to grow. </p><p>De Censi said he was interested in doing the study because the minimum effective dose of tamoxifen hadn't been researched.</p><p>The drug was developed in the late 1960s, he said, and at the time researchers weren't looking for the minimum effective dose because prevention was the key issue. However, above a certain dose, tamoxifen won't produce any extra benefit, but it will raise the risk of side effects, De Censi said. </p><p>The new study included 500 women. They all had either stage 0 breast cancer (called DCIS) or high-risk lesions in their breast tissue that could develop into breast cancer. </p><p>Half of the women took 5 milligrams of tamoxifen daily for three years. The other half took a placebo. The average follow-up time was five years. </p><p>By that time, 5.5 percent of the women taking tamoxifen and about 11 percent of the women taking a placebo had a breast cancer recurrence or a new cancer. </p><p>Taking low-dose tamoxifen lowered the risk of recurrent or new breast cancer by 52 percent, the researchers reported. And the rates of side effects were similar between the two groups. </p><p>About 35 percent of women in the tamoxifen group (and 39 percent in the placebo group) stopped treatment before the study was done. De Censi said if they had continued, it's possible that the low dose of tamoxifen would have proven even more effective. </p><p>Dr. Douglas Marks is a clinical instructor in the oncology/hematology department at NYU Winthrop Hospital in Mineola, N.Y. He said the findings were impressive, and low-dose tamoxifen is a \"very worthy idea to be explored.\"</p><p>But, Marks added, the study doesn't have data for a long enough time period. He said he'd like to see 15 years of follow-up. And the study really needs to compare the 5 mg dose to the standard 20 mg dose to see if it's just as effective.</p><p>\"Different strategies should be evaluated in hormonal therapy,\" Marks said. </p><p>However, women need to know that the current prevention strategies are very effective, he said. If you're taking one of these therapies, talk with your doctor if you're having trouble with side effects, he added. </p><p>\"Before you stop taking a medication, let your doctor know about your side effects. There are a lot of strategies to deal with side effects. Even if you're between appointments, call your doctor to talk about it,\" Marks advised.</p><p>The study is to be presented on Thursday at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Findings presented at meetings are typically viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Learn more about hormone therapy for breast cancer from the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/breast-hormone-therapy-fact-sheet\" target=\"_new\">U.S. National Cancer Institute</a>.</p>",

Also, nursing home residents were less likely to have bedsores, be physically restrained or have significant weight loss -- all measures of quality of care.</p><p>When unemployment rates were low, nursing homes had fewer staff members, higher employee turnover and lower staff retention rates, the researchers found.</p><p>Most nursing home care is provided by nurses and aides, so maintaining an adequate and stable workforce is important for delivering high-quality care, according to the study authors. </p><p>\"The solution lies with changes to federal and state policy, such as measures to increase reimbursement for nursing home care with the goal of paying staff enough to make these positions attractive,\" Huang said in the news release.</p><p>\"Policymakers and researchers have long been concerned about nursing home quality, and this study suggests strong action is needed now,\" he added.</p><p>The report was published in the Dec. 7 issue of <i>The Gerontologist</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>HealthinAging.org has more on <a href=\"http://www.healthinaging.org/aging-and-health-a-to-z/topic:nursing-homes/\" target=\"_new\">nursing homes</a>.</p>",

It was that strain that made flu so severe last year, when 1 million people were hospitalized and 80,000 died.</p><p>Both of these types of flu are included in this season's flu vaccine, as well as one or two influenza B strains. This year's vaccine seems well matched to these strains, so it will most likely be more effective than last year's vaccine, Budd said.</p><p>Because H1N1 is the predominant flu strain around now, she thinks the vaccine's effectiveness could be as high as 65 percent.</p><p>It's not too late to get vaccinated, Budd said. If you haven't gotten a flu shot, it's time, she said. It can take up to two weeks for your body to mount a protective immune response.</p> <p>\"Now is the time to get vaccinated while flu activity is low, especially if you're going to get together with family over the holidays,\" Budd said.</p><p>She said lots of vaccine is available. Since Nov. 30, nearly 164 million doses have been distributed, Budd said. </p><p>\"We know that the vaccine is effective in preventing millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations,\" she said. \"It's the best tool we have to prevent influenza.\"</p><p>Although getting the vaccine is no guarantee that you won't get the flu, if you do, it will be much milder than if you hadn't been vaccinated, Budd said.</p><p>Vaccination protects not only you from getting the flu, but also those around you from getting it.</p><p>The CDC urges that everyone ages 6 months and older get a flu shot. It's especially important for the very young and old and for anyone with a chronic medical condition. Those are the folks most at risk for succumbing to the complications of flu, such as pneumonia.</p><p>In addition, pregnant women should get vaccinated, as should moms of infants too young to get a flu shot and those likely to be around babies.</p><p>Budd stressed that the vaccine can't give you the flu. If you get sick after getting vaccinated, it's most likely from another of the many respiratory viruses around, not the flu virus. </p><p>It's also possible that you were exposed to flu before you got your shot, she said. </p><p>If you do come down with flu, Budd said to try to stay away from other people so you won't spread the disease.</p><p>In addition, antiviral medications such as Tamiflu and Relenza are available and effective in making your bout of flu easier and shorter, Budd said.</p><p>These are particularly useful for people at risk for getting serious complications from flu, she said. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.htm/\" target=\"_new\">flu</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Jan. 8, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- It's a common belief that rising drug prices are due to the high cost of cutting-edge medications, with manufacturers charging a bundle to make back development expenses for their new products.</p><p>But drug companies have also been steadily hiking prices on older brand-name drugs, a new study reports.</p><p>Increasing prices for brand-name pills outpaced the nation's overall rate of inflation nearly fivefold between 2005 and 2016, with consumers paying about 9 percent more every year for the same old drugs between 2005 and 2016.</p><p>The price of injectable brand-name drugs increased by 15 percent yearly during the same period, researchers found.</p><p>\"In the brand-name market, prices are increasing really fast and that's almost solely due to inflation in existing products,\" said lead researcher Inmaculada Hernandez. She's an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy.</p><p>The EpiPen and brand-name insulin products are two prime examples of drugs that have been on the market for a long time, yet have undergone massive price hikes in recent years, Hernandez noted.</p><p>The cost of a two-pack EpiPen injector has increased from around $100 in 2007 to between $300 and $600 today. The list price for Lantus brand insulin increased by 49 percent in 2014, even though the product has been on the market for more than a decade.</p><p><b>Hard choices</b></p><p>These sort of increases on older products undermine efforts by the health care industry to control costs, Hernandez said.</p><p>Steep and arbitrary price hikes for older drugs \"cannot be justified on the basis of more value or better outcomes,\" since people are paying more for products that provide no additional benefit, Hernandez reasoned.</p><p>Price hikes also can cause patients to face hard choices regarding their health. More than one-quarter of people with diabetes have skimped on their insulin shots because of soaring prices, according to a study published in <i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i> last month.</p><p>For the latest study, Hernandez and her colleagues assessed the list price of tens of thousands of medications between 2005 and 2016, using a national database. They also took into account how often the drugs are prescribed, to better reflect each one's contribution to overall U.S. health care costs.</p><p>To assess the impact of new drugs, researchers sorted the meds based on when they entered the market. Drugs were considered \"new\" for the first three years they were available; in the case of generics, for the first three years after patent expiration.</p><p>Prices have been increasing across the board for all drug categories, researchers found.</p><p>For example, generic drug prices have increased by 4.4 percent a year for pills and 7.3 percent annually for injectables.</p><p>And the cost of high-tech specialty medications -- the leading public culprit in rising drug costs -- have been rising annually as well, 20.6 percent for pills and 12.5 percent for injectables.</p><p>Overall, specialty drug prices have risen 13 times faster than national inflation, and even generic pill prices increased by more than double the rate of inflation. However, the cost increases for generic and specialty drugs have been driven largely by new medications entering the market, the study reported.</p><p><b>Profits first?</b></p><p>New drugs accounted for 71 percent of the increase in specialty pill medications and 52 percent of the increase in injectables, researchers said.</p><p>The increase in generics occurs because new generic products tend to cost more, until more manufacturers enter the market and competition drives down prices, Hernandez said.</p><p>There's no apparent reason for the rising cost of brand-name drugs, outside of regular price hikes aimed at boosting company profits, researchers concluded.</p><p>Very few new blockbuster drugs ever enter the brand-name market; new and expensive medications generally are considered specialty drugs, the researchers said.</p><p>\"The United States market for prescribed drugs is really a free-for-all market, and I think we've made peace with that, by and large,\" said Stuart Schweitzer, a professor of health policy and management at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.</p><p>The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), which represents the drug industry, took issue with the new report.</p><p>\"This study provides a flawed and inaccurate portrayal of the U.S. marketplace for medicines,\" said Holly Campbell, the group's deputy vice president of public affairs. She said the wholesale price numbers used in the report failed to \"capture rebates or other types of discounts\" offered by many pharmaceutical companies.</p><p>\"On average, 40 percent of the list price of medicines is given as rebates or discounts to insurance companies, the government, pharmacy benefit managers and other entities in the supply chain that often require large rebates in order for a medicine to be covered,\" Campbell explained.</p> <p>Unfortunately, \"these savings are often not shared with patients whose out-of-pocket costs continue to soar,\" she added.</p><p><b>Lack of competition</b></p><p>But Hernandez said other forces may be at play to send the cost of older drugs skyward, including a lack of competition.</p><p>\"In the case of EpiPen or insulins, they are brand names that have been around for more than one decade at least, and still there's not enough competition\" to cause prices to stay the same or decrease, she said.</p><p>\"Sometimes drug prices make headlines, but usually because they are because of very large prices of new drugs. We want to send the message that year-over-year inflation is a very important contributor to rising drug prices in the brand-name market,\" Hernandez said.</p><p>For his part, Schweitzer questioned whether innovation justifies the high prices of new drugs entering the market.</p><p>\"One argument says the profits have to come from somewhere for innovation, and if you take away those profits then you have less room to innovate,\" said Schweitzer, who wasn't involved with the study.</p><p>\"But the other argument is, no, the drug companies are not stupid, they don't choose projects based on random assignment,\" Schweitzer said. \"They rank every R&amp;D dollar that's spent.

      "Body__c": "<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 13, 2018 (HealthDay News)  -- Federal health investigators said Thursday that they've pinpointed at least one California farm implicated in the recent outbreak of E. coli illness tied to romaine lettuce, but they added that more farms are probably connected.</p><p>So far, 59 people across 15 states have come down with the often severe gastrointestinal illness. Health concerns were so high that just before Thanksgiving, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked Americans to temporarily stop consuming all romaine lettuce  while they investigated the source of the outbreak.</p><p>That investigation has now uncovered at least one source, experts at the FDA and CDC said in a news briefing Thursday afternoon.</p><p>\"One of the samples tested by the CDC was positive for the outbreak strain by genetic fingerprinting, and was found in the sediment of an agricultural water reservoir at one ranch that is owned and operated by Adam Brothers Farming in Santa Barbara County, Calif.,\" said Dr. Stephen Ostroff, senior advisor to the FDA Commissioner.</p><p>He said the farm was cooperating with the investigation. The farm hasn't shipped romaine lettuce since Nov. 20, and Ostroff said the farm is \"committed to recalling products that may have come into contact with water from the agricultural water reservoir.\"</p><p>That said, other farms in the area might still be  implicated, so \"people should still pay close attention to where their lettuce is from,\" he added.</p><p>Because of this and other recent outbreaks, romaine lettuce now sold in the United States has labeling indicating the place and date of harvest. If heads of romaine are sold loose, without affixed labels, retailers are being asked to post a notice showing place and date of harvest near the store register.</p><p>Most romaine sold in the United States is safe to eat. Right now, precautions are limited to romaine lettuce from just a few California counties, the FDA said.</p><p>\"We continue to advise avoiding romaine lettuce from Monterey, San Benito and Santa Barbara counties in California,\" Ostroff said.</p><p>Hydroponically- and greenhouse-grown romaine also does not appear to be related to the current outbreak.</p><p>Illnesses from the E. coli O157:H7 strain implicated in this outbreak have sometimes been  severe. Although no deaths have been reported, there have 23 hospitalizations and 2 cases of kidney failure, health officials said.</p><p>\"The E. coli strain isolated from ill people in the current romaine lettuce outbreak is also closely related to the E. coli strain isolated from people in a 2017 outbreak linked to leafy green in the United States and romaine lettuce in Canada,\" noted FDA Deputy Commissioner Frank Yiannas.</p><p>So who's most at risk from E. coli?</p><p>Dr. Robert Glatter is an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City who's seen the effects of infection with the gastrointestinal bug firsthand. It's not a minor ailment, he said.</p><p>\"In general, symptoms of E. coli infection generally begin about three to four days after consuming the bacteria, and may include abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and watery or bloody diarrhea, along with fever,\" Glatter said.</p><p>And while healthy people who battle a bout of E. coli typically recover within five to seven days, the illness can be more protracted -- and even deadly -- for people already made vulnerable by chronic disease or advanced age.</p><p>\"People with diabetes, kidney disease or those with cancer or autoimmune disease run the risk of a more severe illness,\" Glatter explained.</p><p>The particular strain of E. coli detected in the current lettuce outbreak -- E. coli O157:H7 -- is particularly nasty, he noted.</p><p>\"Most strains of E. coli do not actually cause diarrhea, but E. coli O157 produces a powerful toxin that injures the inner lining of the small intestine, leading to bloody diarrhea,\" Glatter said. Even a tiny amount of ingested bacteria could spur this type of illness.</p><p>\"It can make people much more ill, and may lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure, in some cases,\" he said.</p><p>In many cases, antibiotics are used to help beat back an E. coli infection, but these drugs can affect the kidneys, Glatter noted.</p><p>\"Antibiotics may be necessary in certain cases, so it's important to see your doctor if you have continued and severe symptoms such as fever, bloody diarrhea, and you are not able to eat or drink,\" he said.</p><p>However, in the case of E. coli O157:H7, \"taking antibiotics may actually increase your risk of developing kidney failure, so it's important to speak with your health care provider if you should develop severe symptoms,\" Glatter advised.</p><p>And if you do think you might be sick with E. coli, or any other foodborne illness, make sure you don't spread it to those near you.</p><p>The bacterium \"can be transmitted person-to-person, so it's vital that anyone who is potentially infected wash their hands thoroughly and not share utensils, cups or glasses,\" Glatter said. \"This also goes for bath towels. Linens also need to be washed in hot water and treated with bleach.\"</p><p>He noted that \"ground beef, unpasteurized milk, fresh produce and contaminated water are common sources of E. coli bacteria.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Find out more about E. coli illness at the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/ecoli-symptoms.html\" target=\"_new\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>",

But don't rule out this convenient fitness option so fast.</p><p>According to the American Council on Exercise, if you can clear a 6-foot by 6-foot area for working out, you can outfit a home gym with the basics for under $100. Plus, these space-conscious items can be stored in a closet or under the bed when not in use. Just don't forget that they're there once you buy them!</p><p>Start with a good mat for floor work, like yoga, Pilates, ab exercises and push-ups. The price typically depends on the thickness you choose, and thickness depends on what you're using it for.</p><p>Next is at least one stability ball for doing a variety of exercises, including balance work and crunches. Choose one made for your weight and height. When you're sitting on it, your thighs should be parallel with the floor.</p><p>Stretchy resistance bands are great for strength training when you don't want a full set of weights. On their own, they weigh nothing and take up less space than a pair of socks. You might buy them in various tensions to match up with the different strengths of  various muscle groups. There are also circular bands that go around your ankles for working the outer hips.</p><p>If you'd like to use dumbbells for upper body work, a set with three pairs of graduated weights is an inexpensive option. If you're a beginner, choose a set with 3-, 5- and 10-pound weights; if you're more experienced, go for 5-, 10- and 15-pounds.</p><p>However, you might get more mileage for your money with a barbell and weight plates -- but again, start with low-weight plates and then add as you gain strength.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For details on putting together an <a href=\"https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/lifestyle/blog/6087/how-to-create-a-home-gym-on-a-tight-budget\" target=\"_new\">inexpensive home gym</a>, check out the website of the American Council on Exercise.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Jan. 8, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- The number of women in the United States who are getting the recommended screenings for cervical cancer is \"unacceptably low,\"  researchers say.</p><p>In 2016, just over half of U.S. women aged 21 to 29 and less than two-thirds of women aged 30 to 65 were up-to-date with cervical cancer screenings, according to a new report.</p><p>Those rates are well below the 81 percent self-reported rate in the 2015 U.S. National Health Interview Survey, said study author Dr. Kathy MacLaughlin,  and her colleagues. MacLaughlin is a family medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minn.</p><p>\"Routine screening every three years with a Pap test or every five years with a Pap-HPV co-test [the current guidelines for average-risk women] ensures precancerous changes are caught early and may be followed more closely or treated,\" MacLaughlin explained in a Mayo Clinic news release.</p><p>The study also found significant racial differences in cervical cancer screening rates.</p><p>\"African-American women were 50 percent less likely to be up-to-date on cervical cancer screening than white women in 2016.

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Feb. 1, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Instead of popping a painkiller, a little mindful yoga might go a long way toward easing longstanding pain, a new study suggests.</p><p>The review of 21 clinical trials involving nearly 2,000 people looked at the effects of two drug-free options for chronic pain: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and a program called mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). It combines meditation and gentle yoga postures.</p><p>In general, patients fared better with either therapy than with no treatment or with standard care, including pain medication.</p><p>Experts said the results point to the value of drug-free alternatives for dealing with chronic pain. That's especially important in the context of the current opioid crisis, said Dr. Muhammad Hassan Majeed, a psychiatrist at Natchaug Hospital in Mansfield Center, Conn.</p><p>For chronic pain that is unrelated to cancer, he said, opioids do not work well. Plus, they carry risks of addiction, overdose and even death.</p><p>Majeed, who was not involved in the new report, has published his own reviews of the evidence for mindfulness and other non-drug approaches for chronic pain.</p><p>The bottom line, he said, is that there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" treatment. Instead, there is a range of potentially effective options that people can try.</p><p>\"Medication is not the only one,\" Majeed said.</p><p>That's not a controversial message. Guidelines for managing chronic pain -- from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other groups -- already discourage doctors from prescribing opioids for most people. They also stress that non-drug choices -- from physical therapy to psychological approaches like CBT -- should be among the \"preferred options.\"</p><p>Why would psychological therapies help? Because chronic pain is not purely physical, Majeed said. There is an emotional component, he explained, and the ways people perceive and respond to their pain are crucial.</p><p>CBT helps people change their habitual thought patterns and reactions around their pain, according to Majeed. Mindfulness practices, like meditation, have a similar goal: The typical definition of mindfulness is to focus on what's happening in the moment, rather than letting the mind spin off.</p><p>Right now, CBT is the most widely used psychological approach to treating chronic pain, said Wei Cheng, one of the researchers on the review.</p><p>Only one study in the review directly compared CBT with mindfulness-based stress reduction. So it's not clear whether mindfulness is as effective as CBT, said Cheng, of the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Ontario, Canada.</p><p>But, he added, not everyone who tries CBT for chronic pain finds it helpful. Mindful practices offer \"an alternative and potentially helpful approach,\" he said.</p><p>The review, published Jan. 31 in <i>Evidence Based Mental Health</i>, pulled together 21 clinical trials. Thirteen compared CBT against a \"control\" -- either no treatment or standard therapies like pain medication. In each study, CBT patients had eight to 12 group sessions with a therapist.</p><p>In seven trials, patients were randomly assigned to either MBSR or a control group. MBSR involved eight to 12 weekly sessions with a therapist trained in the program -- along with 45 minutes of daily home practice.</p><p>The patients had long-standing pain from conditions like arthritis, fibromyalgia and temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ), which affects the jaw. A few trials focused on chronic low back pain.</p><p>Overall, Cheng's team found, patients who received either CBT or MBSR typically fared better than the control group. They reported more improvements in pain intensity, physical functioning and depression symptoms.</p><p>On average, those effects were \"small,\" however, the researchers noted.</p><p>But that's to be expected, according to Majeed. He said patients vary widely in how much relief they get from CBT or mindfulness -- in part, because of the motivation it takes to incorporate what they learn into daily life.</p><p>Plus, Majeed said, while these approaches can help people manage their pain and \"feel better,\" they won't erase the pain.</p><p>For any one person, the choice of whether to try CBT or MBSR will partly depend on personal preferences, according to Majeed. But there are also practical matters, he added, including availability of therapists and insurance coverage.</p><p>MBSR is a specific program. But its components -- mindfulness meditation and gentle yoga -- are available in many formats.</p><p>An important thing to keep in mind, Majeed noted, is that these approaches do not produce instant relief.</p><p>\"It takes time to heal, and to adopt a new lifestyle,\" he said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health has more on <a href=\"https://nccih.nih.gov/health/pain/consumer\" target=\"_new\">pain treatment</a>.</p>",

Now, research confirms the meds can also help people aged 75 and older.</p><p>\"Statin therapy has been shown to prevent cardiovascular disease in a wide range of people, but there has been uncertainty about its efficacy and safety among older people,\" said lead investigator Anthony Keech. He's a professor of medicine, cardiology and epidemiology at the University of Sydney in Australia.</p><p>He and colleagues at the University of Oxford in England analyzed the findings of 28 large clinical trials of statins. The trials involved nearly 187,000 people in six age groups: younger than 55; 55 to 60; 60 to 65; 65 to 70;  70 to 75; and older than 75.</p><p>\"Our study summarized all the available evidence from major trials to help clarify this issue. We found that there were significant reductions in major vascular events in each of the six age groups considered, including patients [who were] aged over 75 at the start of treatment,\" Keech said in an Oxford news release.</p><p>Major vascular events included heart attack, stroke and procedures to clear clogged arteries.</p><p>\"Statin therapy appears to be just as effective in people aged over 75 years as it is in younger people,\" study co-investigator Jordan Fulcher said in the news release. Fulcher is a cardiovascular research fellow at the University of Sydney.</p><p>\"We have definitive evidence that statins benefit older people who have suffered a heart attack or stroke. Fewer healthy older people were represented in these trials, so more information in this group of people would help confirm the same benefits that we see in our overall trials population,\" he said.</p><p>Fulcher noted that a new randomized trial in Australia is exploring whether statins prolong disability-free survival in a healthy population.</p><p>The risk of heart attacks and strokes rises sharply with age, yet statins are not used as widely in older people as they should be, study co-investigator Colin Baigent said in the news release. He's director of Oxford's Medical Research Council Population Health Research Unit.</p><p>\"Since the risk of heart attack and stroke increases with age, the potential benefits are likely to be even greater for older people,\" he said.</p><p>\"Therefore, there is a need to ensure that patients at risk of cardiovascular disease due to their age are offered statin therapy where there is good reason to believe that it will be beneficial,\" Baigent said.</p><p>Anyone with concerns about whether statin therapy is right for them should discuss it with their health care provider, he added.</p><p>The findings were published Jan. 31 in <i>The Lancet</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has more on <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/drugsafety/ucm293474.pdf\" target=\"_new\">statins</a>.</p>",

That might change with the new drug, called sacituzumab govitecan, which combines an antibody with a chemotherapy drug to better target cancer cells. </p><p>In the trial, funded by the drug's maker, about a third of the patients responded to treatment and the effect lasted up to eight months, said  study senior author Dr. Kevin Kalinsky. </p><p>\"These patients had a significant reduction of their cancer,\" he added. \"This is an exciting new therapeutic.\"</p><p>About 50 percent had some response and saw a slowing of cancer progression for about five months, he noted.</p><p>Kalinsky, an oncologist at the Irving Medical Center at New York-Presbyterian-Columbia University, also noted: \"This is a patient population where we really need new therapeutics.\" </p><p>Triple-negative breast cancer represents about 15 percent of all breast cancer and is most often seen in young women and black women, although why it affects these women isn't known, according to Dr. J. Leonard Lichtenfeld, the interim chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society.</p><p>The cancer is different from other breast cancers because tumor cells don't have protein HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), estrogen receptors or progesterone receptors, which means that hormonal treatment or drugs that target HER2 are ineffective. Chemotherapy shrinks or slows its progress in only about 10 percent to 15 percent of these patients, and the effect only lasts about two to three months, the researchers said.</p><p>Survival for women with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer is around a year, and that has not changed for 20 years, they noted.</p><p>In this phase 2 trial, 108 women who had failed treatment with other drugs were treated with sacituzumab govitecan. The drug combines an antibody to the Trop-2 antigen, which is found on most breast cancer cells, with the chemotherapy drug irinotecan.</p><p>When the antibody latches onto the Trop-2 molecules of the cancer cells, the drug is released within cells and into the areas of the tumor. This targeted delivery allows the chemotherapy drug to reach cancer cells and helps reduce the toxic effect of the drug to healthy cells, the researchers said. </p><p>The trial lasted from June 2013 to February 2017 and was funded by New Jersey-based Immunomedics.</p><p>Patients were given the drug for as long as they benefited from treatment, and eight women were still on the drug as of December 2017. The average time of treatment was more than five months, which was longer than the average 2.5 months with patients' other treatments, the researchers found. </p><p>Some of the drug's side effects included nausea, diarrhea and a drop in white blood cells. Researchers said these symptoms were manageable.</p><p>The drug is not yet available, Kalinsky said. A phase 3 trial comparing sacituzumab govitecan with other treatments for triple-negative breast cancer is now underway. </p><p>\"This is a step forward for women where there were not any real treatment options,\" said Lichtenfeld, who was not involved with the study. \"It was not a cure -- we still have a long way to go.\"</p><p>He added that the drug might be more effective if it were given earlier, when the cancer was still confined to the breast. </p><p>\"Even with these results, however, it represents a better outcome than any of the treatments used in this form of breast cancer,\" Lichtenfeld said. </p><p>The report was published Feb. 20 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>. </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Cancer Society offers more information on <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer.html/\" target=\"_new\">breast cancer</a>.</p>",

Level A means evidence came from multiple randomized controlled trials. Level B means that evidence came from a single randomized controlled trial or observational studies. And level C means the recommendation is based only on expert opinion.</p><p>Only 8.5 percent of ACC/AHA recommendations relied on level A evidence, while 50 percent had level B data and 41.5 percent had level C data, the researchers found.</p><p>\"In 2009, there was a call for improvement in the clinical research enterprise after [an] earlier study highlighted several deficiencies,\" explained senior study author Dr. Renato Lopes, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at Duke University.</p><p>\"But really, despite some initiatives and a greater focus on conducting randomized controlled trials, the chasm between evidence and the need for evidence has not improved,\" Lopes said in a Duke news release.</p><p>\"As a matter of fact, the proportion of U.S. recommendations from cardiovascular guidelines supported by high-quality evidence actually decreased from 11 percent to 9 percent in the last decade,\" Lopes noted.</p><p>The findings were published online March 15 in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>.</p> <p>According to study lead author Dr. Alexander Fanaroff, \"Patients should have an expectation that the science behind the care they receive is solid and will result in improved outcomes. Progress in reducing cardiovascular mortality has decelerated over the past several years, so improving the evidence base for treatment guidelines could help forestall this trend.\" </p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute offers a <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/docs/public/heart/healthyheart.pdf\" target=\"_new\">guide to a healthy heart</a>.</p>",

It found that opioid use increases the likelihood of A-fib by 34 percent.</p><p>\"We all know that the opioid epidemic is taking an unspeakable human toll through addiction, abuse and overdose, but our findings suggest that the toll may be even greater when we consider the cardiovascular effects opioids may have,\" said lead investigator Dr. Jonathan Stock. He's a resident at Yale New Haven Hospital in Connecticut.</p><p>The researchers said their findings are based on tracking opioid use, not abuse, and show opioids are dangerous even when the drugs are not abused or users are not addicts.</p><p>\"Our results point to the importance of prescribing opioids only as a last resort,\" Stock said. \"Opioid use, by itself, must be taken seriously and efforts should be made, not only to reduce opioid abuse and overdoses, but to ensure patients are being prescribed opioids only when absolutely necessary.\"</p><p>For the study, Stock's team analyzed medical records of more than 857,000 veterans between the ages of 25 and 51.</p><p>About 3,000 of them had been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. Of those, nearly 29 percent had used opioids, compared with 15 percent of vets without the heart irregularity.</p><p>The risk for a-fib remained even after researchers accounted for other heart disease risk factors. </p><p>Of concern was the finding that atrial fibrillation was seen in young healthy people. The average age of those in the study was 38. The abnormality is typically more common among those 65 and older.</p><p>The researchers offered a possible reason for the link between opioid use and a-fib. They theorize that opioids may lead to or worsen breathing problems during sleep as well as obstructive sleep apnea, a known risk factor for cardiac rhythm disturbances.</p><p>The findings are to be presented Nov. 10 at a meeting of the American Heart Association in Chicago. </p><p>Research presented at meetings is typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p> To learn more about atrial fibrillation, visit the <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/atrial-fibrillation\" target=\"_new\"> American Heart Association</a>.</p>",

In fact, she was planning to franchise a popular workshop that offers classes devoted to the activity.</p> <p>\"You go in with friends, drink wine and make a custom piece of wooden pallet art for your home decor,\" she said. \"It's fun.\" Unfortunately, fate had other plans.</p> <p>One morning in February 2017, while getting her children ready for school, Amy felt a heavy sensation in her chest. Her arms began to ache so badly that she couldn't finish brushing her daughter's hair. Within minutes, her skin turned pale and she started to hyperventilate. </p> <p>Although Amy had never experienced a panic attack, that was her best guess about what was happening. </p> <p>\"What else could it be?\" she said. After all, she was young, healthy and active, regularly participating in spinning classes and playing competitive tennis matches against her husband, John Paul.</p> <p>Admittedly stubborn by nature, Amy was adamant that John Paul not dial 911. He did it anyway. Her stubborn streak continued when the paramedics arrived. She insisted upon walking to the ambulance. As paramedics checked her vital signs, she tried to convince them that she was fine. </p> <p>Then her heart stopped.</p> <p>As the ambulance sped to the hospital, paramedic Dave Sauls performed CPR. \"I kept expecting her to come out of it,\" he said, \"but it wasn't happening.\"</p> <p>At the emergency room, the nurses took over chest compressions and continued to perform CPR and AED shocks for nearly 45 minutes.</p> <p>An angiogram revealed a 100 percent blockage of her left anterior descending artery. This type of heart attack is commonly known as the widow maker. Worse yet, the blockage was caused by spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), meaning a tear in the artery wall.</p> <p>SCAD is a rare event that occurs mostly in women (about 80 percent), with an average age younger than 50. Other disorders are believed to make people more likely to suffer SCAD. One of them is a disease of the blood vessels called fibromuscular dysplasia, which Amy was later diagnosed with having. </p> <p>At her local hospital, doctors decided she needed more specialized help than they could provide.</p> <p>Amy spent nine days in a medically induced coma. Once she awoke, she saw John Paul sitting at the foot of her hospital bed. She had no idea of what had happened. </p> <p>After the sedatives and other medications left her system, Amy felt so wired she couldn't sleep a wink for two straight days (\"my eyes were like saucers,\" she said). Watching the clock tick away hour by hour, she was terrified she could experience another heart attack at any moment. Any sort of chest pain causes her anxiety to this day.</p> <p>\"Since I don't remember what it felt like, I don't have a frame of reference,\" she said. \"It's terrifying -- the inner turmoil of a cardiac patient.\"</p> <p>After 21 days in the hospital, and surviving bouts of double pneumonia and a narrowing of her trachea, Amy was released. It took more than a year for her to start feeling like herself again.</p> <p>Although her heart function is permanently compromised, she is working to build strength and stamina. In the past, Amy didn't consider it a workout unless she was drenched in sweat. But that's no longer possible. Nor are the competitive tennis matches with John Paul.</p> <p>\"It's been a hard adjustment,\" Amy said. \"I had to shift my mentality a bit. It's about how much I can get done before my heart rate hits 160 bpm.\"</p> <p>One day, Dave Sauls, the paramedic, received a Facebook message from John Paul.</p> <p>Dave had heard Amy died. So, of course, he was \"flabbergasted\" by the message that said she was recovering at home.</p> <p>\"It was a gift from God in my life and something I needed at the time,\" he said. \"I sat there and cried.\"</p> <p>Since then, Dave and Amy have become close friends. He has trained many of her friends in CPR. </p> <p>Eager to raise awareness about women's heart health in general and SCAD specifically, Amy has recorded local public service announcements and attended fundraising walks.</p> <p>\"I look at it as my responsibility to warn other women that this can happen to anybody,\" Amy said. \"I didn't believe that it could happen to me, and my stubbornness almost cost my kids their mother.\"</p> <p>While it still stings that somebody else bought the home decor and art-making franchise that Amy wanted to buy into, she continues to make and sell her own pieces. She uses the name Heartwood, which her children suggested.</p> <p>\"This,\" she said, \"is my therapy.\" </p>",

She is an associate professor of psychology at the University of Arizona.</p><p>Edgin and her colleagues assessed 25 children with Down syndrome, average age 4.5 years, and 24 typically developing children, average age 2.5 years.</p><p>The researchers tested the children's ability to remember new words 5 minutes after they'd learned the words. The children were then tested again 4 hours after they'd learned the words and stayed awake, 4 hours after they'd learned the words and had a nap, and 24 hours later.</p><p>The typically developing children were more likely to remember the new words 4 hours and 24 hours after learning them if they took a 90-minute nap shortly after learning the word. </p><p>However, if the children with Down syndrome napped after learning the words, they were much less likely to remember them 4 hours and 24 hours later than if they didn't nap, the findings showed.</p><p>The study was published Oct. 29 in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>.</p><p>Further research is needed to learn why naps may harm learning in children with Down syndrome, said Edgin, who noted that REM sleep is reduced in people with Down syndrome. REM is a normal stage of sleep that is characterized by rapid eye movements, more dreaming and bodily movement, and faster pulse and breathing. </p><p>\"There might be something about getting too little REM sleep and not completing that REM stage that could be related to difficulties with retention,\" Edgin said in a university news release. </p><p>\"There are some recent studies that suggest that people show poorer retention if they get just a little bit of REM than if they get a whole REM cycle,\" she explained. \"More work needs to be done, but REM sleep is definitely something to consider.\"</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The National Down Syndrome Society has more on <a href=\"https://www.ndss.org/\" target=\"_new\">Down syndrome</a>.</p>",

The researchers also found that <i>Bartonella</i>  genotypes are distributed widely across Central and South America -- and not clustered geographically. </p><p><i>Bartonella</i> is often spread through bites, but the bats' saliva and fecal samples were also positive for the infection, suggesting the bacteria can spread through environmental contamination.</p><p>The findings were published Sept. 27 in the journal <i>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</i>.</p><p>But the researchers noted that more studies are needed to explore how <i>Bartonella</i> spreads from bats to people.</p><p>\"Given the high rates of vampire bat bites and proximity to humans and domestic animals, such efforts to verify the possibility and frequency of oral and environmental exposures\" would help scientists nail down how common transmission of <i>Bartonella</i> between species is, the study authors said in a journal news release.</p><p><b>More information</b></p> <p>The U.S. Geological Survey has more about <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/are-bats-dangerous?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products\" target=\"_new\"> vampire bats</a>.</p>",

But there are safety precautions to take when you leave a protected indoor environment.</p><p>The Road Runners Club of America has a wealth of advice.</p><p>For starters, take some precautions before you leave home. First, tell loved ones where you'll be running. Next, in addition to taking ID with you, write your name, phone number and blood type (in case of an accident) inside one of your running shoes. Also, carry your cellphone.</p><p>\"There's safety in numbers\" is an old expression that still holds true. Steer clear of unpopulated areas, deserted or unlit streets, even overgrown trails. Trust your intuition -- if a situation just doesn't feel right, stay away from it. Also get in the habit of varying your running pattern, but do run in familiar areas.</p><p>While it's easy to lose yourself in your thoughts or music, stay alert. That means skipping the headphones. You want both your eyes and ears attuned to your environment.</p><p>Whether you run on city streets or country roads, go against the flow of traffic so you can see oncoming vehicles and they can see you. This should allow you to react more quickly to a problem.</p><p>Remember mom's lessons about crossing streets -- look both ways at all intersections. Do obey traffic signals, and don't blindly assume that drivers will see you or that they'll stop for you, especially those turning into your path.</p><p>If you want to go running while traveling, ask the local running club or running store for safe routes. Stick to areas with open businesses in case of an emergency and, of course, follow all the safety steps you would at home.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>For more <a href=\"https://www.rrca.org/education/rrca-general-running-safety-tips\" target=\"_new\">safety tips</a> check out the website of the Road Runners Club of America.</p>",

She is program director in the College of Humanities and Sciences at the University of Phoenix.</p><p>\"However, for veterans, that has not translated into a shift in the perception of mental health. Many of our veterans served in a culture where talking about your feelings or seeking help was not widely accepted,\" she added in a university news release.</p><p>The recently released survey results bear that out: More than 90 percent of all veterans and active-duty service members said mental health is as important as physical health. But only 30 percent of veterans have sought or considered mental health counseling, compared with 72 percent of active-duty service members.</p><p>This difference may be because veterans retain old stereotypes and stigmas associated with mental health counseling, the researchers noted.</p><p>The survey also found that 89 percent of active-duty military members believe people who receive professional counseling generally get somewhat or a lot better, compared with 66 percent of veterans.</p><p>In addition, 91 percent of active-duty service members say their leaders openly discuss the importance of dealing with mental health concerns, while only 23 percent of veterans say that their leaders did so.</p><p>When veterans were asked what resources they would use to manage mental health, free counseling was the most common response  (39 percent).</p><p>Fifty-eight percent of veterans said they would be encouraged to seek mental health counseling if a close colleague, friend or family member discussed their experiences receiving counseling.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Institute of Mental Health has more on <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies/index.shtml\" target=\"_new\">counseling</a>.</p>",

However, one aspect of recordkeeping -- how often to get on the scale -- has been the subject of much debate.</p><p>Daily weigh-ins used to be thought of as negative, capable of discouraging you if the pounds didn't come off fast enough, or if day-to-day fluctuations were frustrating. But more recent research has found that it can be a powerful motivator.</p><p>While there's a lot more to dropping pounds than just getting on the scale, weighing yourself can be an important part of the plan. One study found participants achieved weight loss success with daily self-monitoring that included a weigh-in, counting steps and recording fruit, vegetable and water intake.</p><p>Stepping on the scale every day can also help you avoid the natural tendency to gain weight as you age by alerting you early on should pounds sneak on, enabling you to adjust your calorie intake. And, equally important, it plays a role in maintaining weight loss.</p><p>Surveys show that people who successfully keep weight off are more likely to weigh themselves frequently as part of their maintenance plan. The scale in essence functions as an early warning detection system, showing you if your weight starts to creep up.</p><p>The problem is that, over time, people lose interest in tracking their weight, said University of Pittsburgh researchers who followed a group of dieters for a year and a half. Even though weigh-ins helped with weight loss over the first 6 months, adherence to using the scale progressively declined over the following year.</p><p>The answer is to make getting on the scale as much of a habit as brushing your teeth, and to log your weight every day, whether you use your computer, smartphone or an old-school paper record.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Consumer Reports has more tips on <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/scales/the-best-time-to-weigh-yourself/\" target=\"_new\">the best ways to weigh yourself</a> for accuracy and motivation.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>TUESDAY, Jan. 15, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- A stem cell transplant may help some people with multiple sclerosis (MS) when standard drugs fail, a new clinical trial finds.</p><p>The study focused on 110 patients with aggressive cases of MS: Their symptoms had flared up at least twice in the past year despite taking standard medication, and they'd already tried an average of three of those drugs.</p><p>Researchers randomly assigned the patients to either keep trying other medications or have a stem cell transplant -- using cells taken from their own blood.</p><p>Over an average of three years, MS progressed in 34 of 55 patients on medication -- meaning their disabilities worsened. That compared with only three of 55 patients given a stem cell transplant.</p><p>It's a striking difference, said lead researcher Dr. Richard Burt, adding that the results were even better than his team anticipated.</p><p>That said, Burt cautioned that only a small minority of MS patients would be possible transplant candidates. And for now, only certain medical centers have the necessary experience and expertise.</p><p>\"Any treatment that is powerful can also be dangerous,\" said Burt, who is chief of immunotherapy and autoimmune diseases at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. \"You don't want to use it too soon, or too late. And you don't want to overuse it.\"</p><p>Those precautions were echoed by Bruce Bebo, executive director of research for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.</p><p>\"This study should be celebrated,\" said Bebo, who was not involved in the research. \"It's the first randomized, controlled clinical trial of this strategy.\"</p><p>But, he stressed, the treatment is still experimental and can only be done safely at a handful of centers around the world. </p><p>Stem cell transplants are done at many hospitals to treat cancer. But, Bebo said, there's an \"art and science\" to using them for MS.</p><p>MS is a neurological disorder caused by a misguided immune system attack on the body's own myelin -- the protective sheath around nerve fibers in the spine and brain. Depending on where the damage occurs, symptoms include vision problems, muscle weakness, numbness and difficulty with balance and coordination.</p><p>About 85 percent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with the \"relapsing-remitting\" form of the disease, according to the National MS Society. That means symptoms flare up for a time and then ease. But most people eventually transition to a progressive form of the disease and their disability worsens over time.</p><p>The new trial included only patients with relapsing-remitting MS, because that point in the disease is when immune system inflammation is inflicting its damage.</p><p>Why would a stem cell transplant help? The idea, Burt explained, is to basically \"reboot\" the immune system and stop it from attacking.</p><p>Stem cells from the bone marrow are the building blocks of the immune system. In this trial, patients had a supply of their own bone marrow stem cells removed and stored, then underwent a few days of chemotherapy to knock down their existing immune system.</p><p>After that, the stored stem cells were infused back into the body, where over time, the immune system rebuilt itself.</p><p>Half of the study patients had that procedure. The other half continued with disease-modifying drugs -- like natalizumab (Tysabri), interferon (Avonex) and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone). Those medications can slow, but not stop, MS progression, Burt said.</p><p>Over the next few years, stem cell transplant patients were much less likely to see their MS progress, the study found.</p><p>\"And, Burt said, \"their quality of life markedly improved.\"</p><p>When patients rated their quality of life on a standard scale, the transplant group reported an average 20-point gain one year later. Those ratings dipped a few points among patients on medication.</p><p>The study, published in the Jan. 15 issue of the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>, was funded by government and foundation grants.</p><p>Burt cautioned that stem cell transplants carry risks, including serious, even fatal, infections while the immune system is suppressed. No patient in this trial died.</p><p>Bebo also pointed out that the study patients did not take the newest MS drugs, such as a medication called Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), which was approved after this trial ended in 2016.</p><p>\"It's unclear how stem cell transplants compare with the most effective current drug therapies,\" Bebo said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The National MS Society has more on <a href=\"https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Research/Research-News-Progress/Stem-Cells-in-MS/Bone-Marrow-Stem-Cell-Transplant-%E2%80%93-HSCT\" target=\"_new\"> stem cell transplants</a>.</p>",

The most common allergens are milk, egg, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish and shellfish.</p><p>\"It's important for people to remember that even though the main ingredients in a dish may be fine, some ingredients can be hidden and cause allergic reactions,\" said Dr. Russell Traister. He is an allergist and immunologist at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C.</p><p>People with food allergies need to be aware of cross-contamination. For example, peanut protein can remain on a bowl or work surface for up to five hours and still cause a severe reaction for someone with a peanut allergy.</p><p>In addition, people with food allergies should always have an EpiPen or the generic version of the epinephrine auto-injector with them. They should make sure it has not expired, and that friends and family members know how to use it, Traister said.</p><p>If you're attending a holiday gathering with a child or other family member who has food allergies, bring at least one dish that's safe for them in case there aren't any other options, he said.</p><p>If you're hosting a get-together, keep all prepared food packaging so guests can check the ingredients for any potential allergens.</p><p>Food allergy symptoms can range from rashes, coughing and vomiting to potentially life-threatening reactions, such as swelling of the tongue and the inability to breathe.</p><p>\"If you think you or a friend or family member is having an allergic reaction and you don't have an epinephrine auto-injector with you, call 911 immediately or go to the closest emergency department,\" Traister said in a Wake Forest news release.</p><p>\"Even if you use your epinephrine auto-injector, you should still seek medical attention to prevent a second reaction,\" he added.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians has more on <a href=\"https://familydoctor.org/condition/food-allergies/?adfree=true\" target=\"_new\">food allergies</a>.</p>",

They then tracked weight gain in the babies to age 3 years.</p><p>Antibiotics and antimicrobial agents can alter any person's gut makeup (microbiome) by killing off certain species of bacteria, which allows room for others to blossom.</p><p>The most notorious example is <i>Clostridium difficile</i>, a bacteria that can flourish from overuse of antibiotics and lead to life-threatening diarrhea.</p><p>According to Kozyrskyj, \"Disinfectant products used very often, weekly or greater, did cause changes to the infants' gut bacteria. It caused some bacteria to decline and others to increase.\" </p><p>Specifically, antibacterial cleaners were linked to an increase in gut levels of <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> in infants.</p><p><i>Lachnospiraceae</i> bacteria should not be heavily present in the guts of babies who are not yet on solid food, explained Gail Cresci, an expert in pediatric gastroenterology with the Cleveland Clinic.</p><p>These bacteria typically are \"good\" bacteria that feed on tough-to-digest carbohydrate fibers, contributing extra energy to the body, Cresci said.</p><p>\"You don't start to see them until the diet has been advanced to solids, around the age of 2 or 3,\" she added.</p><p>Having an abundance of <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> bacteria from an early age could cause growing kids to be bombarded with additional calories, Cresci said.</p><p>\"It could make sense that if there is an increase of these bacteria early, at 3 months, it could then allow the microbiome to harvest more energy and at that age, it would be stored as fat,\" Cresci explained. \"That could potentially contribute to obesity later.\"</p><p>Infants living in homes with the highest use of disinfectants were twice as likely to have a gut microbiome enriched with <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, the researchers reported.</p><p>Higher <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> levels were associated with higher BMI scores at ages 1 and 3, according to the report.</p><p> Kozyrskyj said that the researchers  \"found that those <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> elevated with disinfectant use were likely responsible for this overweight development. They were in the pathway.\"</p><p>Infants were more likely to have normal weight when eco-friendly cleaners were used daily. These cleaners are either homemade or store-bought cleaners that use natural ingredients such as vinegar, peroxide, baking soda, citric acid or essential oils, Kozyrskyj noted.</p><p>Although the findings are interesting, you can't draw a clear cause-and-effect relationship from this study, said Dr. Sheela Magge, director of pediatric endocrinology at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore.</p><p>\"I would agree there's biologic plausibility, but we obviously need more work to establish what's the cause and what's the effect,\" Magge said. \"It's always difficult to really establish that one particular thing, in this case these household cleaners, causes increased weight gain.\"</p><p>The study, which was funded in part by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, was published Sept. 17 in the <i>CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal)</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The American Cleaning Institute has more about <a href=\"https://www.cleaninginstitute.org/clean_living_at_home/\" target=\"_new\">household cleaners</a>.</p>",

The group included 23 women from the United Kingdom, seven from the United States, and one from Norway. </p><p>The most common reason for egg freezing was not having a partner or having a partner who wouldn't commit to fatherhood, the findings showed.</p><p>Some of the women said they wanted to relieve the pressure of trying to find a suitable partner. Many said they hoped never to have to use their frozen eggs because they would conceive naturally with a future partner. Several said that freezing their eggs was emotionally difficult because they wanted to become mothers with a committed partner.</p><p>The researchers also found that the information available to women considering freezing their eggs was inadequate. For example, nearly all of the women said the clinics they talked with couldn't provide an estimate of the chances of a live birth with the frozen eggs. There was also little in-depth discussion with doctors about processes and outcomes after egg freezing.</p><p>The study was published online Nov. 1 in the journal <i>Human Fertility</i>.</p><p>Growing numbers of women are considering egg freezing, so more needs to be done to fully inform and support those who have the procedure, according to the researchers.</p><p>\"Furthermore, women should be informed of the costs and risks, as well as the physical and emotional demands of egg freezing and any future [in vitro fertilization] treatment,\" Baldwin added in a journal news release.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>There's more on egg freezing at the <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Gynecologic-Practice/Oocyte-Cryopreservation\" target=\"_new\">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>WEDNESDAY, Dec. 5, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Checking for low hemoglobin in the blood -- otherwise known as anemia -- usually means drawing blood for testing.</p><p>But scientists say they've developed a wireless smartphone app that does the same by \"reading\" a quick photo of your fingernail.</p><p>The app converts fingernail colors into quick readings of blood hemoglobin levels, according to researchers at Emory University in Atlanta. They said the technology could be used by anyone at any time, but its use right now is  limited to screening, not a formal diagnosis of anemia.</p><p>Anemia is a blood condition affecting 2 billion people worldwide. If untreated, it can lead to fatigue, paleness and heart problems.</p><p>Typical methods of screening for anemia \"require external equipment, and represent trade-offs between invasiveness, cost and accuracy,\" lead researcher Dr. Wilbur Lam, associate professor of pediatrics, explained in an Emory news release.</p><p>But the new app has an accuracy that's \"on par with currently available point-of-care tests,  without the need to draw blood,\" Lam said.</p><p>The investigators believe the app could be useful for screening pregnant women, women with abnormal menstrual bleeding, or runners and other athletes. Its simplicity also means it could help people in developing countries.</p><p>The app could be available for download as soon as spring 2019, the researchers said.</p><p>One member of the development team, Rob Mannino, had a personal stake in the technology's success. The former biomedical engineering graduate student has an inherited blood disorder called beta-thalassemia.</p><p>\"Treatment for my disease requires monthly blood transfusions,\" Mannino explained in the news release. \"My doctors would test my hemoglobin levels more if they could, but it's a hassle for me to get to the hospital in between transfusions to receive this blood test. Instead, my doctors currently have to just estimate when I'm going to need a transfusion, based on my hemoglobin level trends.\"</p><p>In the new study, published Dec. 4 in <i>Nature Communications</i>, Lam's team used data on 237 people -- some anemic, some not -- to develop an algorithm that converted fingernail color to represent blood hemoglobin levels.</p><p>It was then tested on 100 patients and proved highly accurate in people with both dark and light skin tones, the research team said. That's because the nail bed does not contain melanin, which gives skin its color.</p><p>The app should enable patients with chronic anemia to monitor themselves to know when they need to adjust their therapies or receive transfusions. This could reduce side effects or complications of having transfusions too early or too late, Lam's team said.</p><p>Mannino's experience proved integral to the research.</p><p>\"This whole project couldn't have been done by anyone but Rob,\" Lam said. \"He took pictures of himself before and after transfusions as his hemoglobin levels were changing, which enabled him to constantly refine and tweak his technology on himself in a very efficient manner. So essentially, he was his own perfect initial test subject with each iteration of the app.\"</p><p>One doctor who often treats anemia in children was optimistic about the new technology, with one caveat.</p><p>Dr. Michael Grosso directs pediatrics at Huntington Hospital in Huntington, N.Y. He agreed that \"the availability of a rapid, accurate and non-invasive anemia screening test could have significant benefits.\"</p><p>But he was concerned that the app might miss more subtle forms of anemia.</p><p>\"It turns out that mild iron deficiency can affect the body without triggering anemia, and children in that situation would be missed by the non-invasive test,\" Grosso said. \"So, the smartphone test definitely falls short of the tried-and-true blood count, but it is better than no test at all.\"</p><p>For their part, Lam and colleagues said further research, conducted with a variety of patient types, is ongoing. That means the app's sensitivity and accuracy should improve with time.</p><p>\"This is just a snapshot of the accuracy right now,\" Lam said. \"The algorithm gets smarter with every patient enrolled.\"</p><p>The research was funded in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Lam and Mannino have filed a patent application for the anemia app, and will have financial interest in its success.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has more on <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/anemia\" target=\"_new\">anemia</a>.</p>",

      "Body__c": "<p>FRIDAY, Jan. 4, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- More than 10 percent of U.S. adults have a food allergy -- and nearly double that believe they do, a new study estimates.</p><p>Researchers found that 19 percent of those surveyed thought they had a food allergy. But when the investigators dug into people's symptoms, they found that only 10.8 percent reported \"convincing\" signs of a true allergy.</p><p>Experts said the findings highlight two important facts: Food allergies are common among U.S. adults, and many mistakenly believe they have one.</p><p>\"There are many misconceptions around reactions to food,\" said lead researcher Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University, in Chicago.</p><p>According to Gupta, it can be easy for people to assume food-related symptoms signal an allergy. But other conditions can be the real culprit, she said.</p><p>People with true allergies have an immune system reaction against proteins in a particular food. Those reactions, Gupta explained, can sometimes be severe -- including life-threatening breathing difficulties or drops in blood pressure.</p><p>So it's critical to get an accurate diagnosis, she noted.</p><p>Dr. Wayne Shreffler, a medical advisor to the non-profit Food Allergy Research &amp; Education, agreed.</p><p>\"Sometimes people think, 'What difference does it make? If the food makes me feel bad, I'll avoid it,'\" Shreffler said.</p><p>But people with a true allergy need to completely eliminate the offending food from their diet -- and they should get professional guidance on how to do that, he suggested.</p><p>They should also get a prescription for epinephrine, Shreffler said. The drug, given by auto-injector, treats severe allergic reactions in an emergency.</p><p>On the flip side, food avoidance can be very challenging -- so people without an allergy should not do it unnecessarily, he added.</p><p>What other conditions can cause food-related woes? One possibility, Gupta said, is a food intolerance -- such as difficulty digesting lactose, a sugar in milk.</p><p>Unlike allergies, food intolerances do not involve the immune system. They arise from an issue in the digestive system -- like an enzyme deficiency -- that makes it hard to break down a particular food.</p><p>In other cases, Gupta said, people have an oral allergy syndrome. That occurs when someone with a pollen allergy has a reaction to a food with proteins similar to pollen -- usually a raw fruit or vegetable. The symptoms include itchiness in the mouth or throat, or swelling around the lips.</p><p>That type of reaction is not life-threatening, and people may be able to avert it by simply cooking the offending produce, Gupta said.</p><p>The study, published online Jan. 4 in <i>JAMA Network Open</i>, included more than 40,400 U.S. adults.</p><p>Overall, 19 percent reported food allergies. However, only 10.8 percent had ever suffered \"convincing\" symptoms -- such as hives, throat constriction, lip or tongue swelling, vomiting, difficulty breathing or rapid heartbeat.</p><p>Certain other symptoms -- like cramps or diarrhea -- were not considered convincing, because they are more likely to indicate a food intolerance.</p><p>Among people with true allergies, shellfish was the most common culprit: An estimated 3 percent of adults were allergic to shellfish. Milk allergy (1.9 percent) and peanut allergy (1.8 percent) were next in line. Many people had more than one food allergy, the findings showed.</p><p>And surprisingly, allergies often developed in adulthood, rather than childhood. Almost half of participants with convincing symptoms developed at least one of their allergies as an adult, according to the report.</p><p>It has long been known that adults can develop new food allergies. But Gupta was \"really surprised\" by how often that was reported in the study.</p><p>Shreffler agreed, calling the finding \"striking.\"</p><p>It's not fully clear why food allergies arise in adults, according to Shreffler. But in some cases, he said, it may be a matter of exposure. Many kids turn their noses up at shellfish, for example -- so an allergy might not become apparent until later in life.</p><p>Gupta's team also found that only half of study participants with convincing food allergy symptoms had ever received a formal diagnosis.</p><p>Some may self-diagnose and skip the doctor visit, both Gupta and Shreffler said. But it's also possible for doctors to miss the diagnosis.</p><p>\"I think that finding is a bit of a wake-up call to the medical community,\" Shreffler said.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>Food Allergy Research &amp; Education has more on <a href=\"https://www.foodallergy.org/life-with-food-allergies/food-allergy-101/diagnosis-testing\" target=\"_new\">food allergy diagnosis</a>.</p>",

The study included hundreds of participants, either with autism or without the disorder.</p><p>The autism group had prolonged connectivity (up to 20 seconds) between brain areas, while those links faded much more quickly in people without autism, the findings showed.</p><p>The researchers also found that the autism symptoms increased with the duration of connectivity between brain regions.</p><p>\"This is a whole new perspective into how autism works in the brain, and can help us develop strategies for treatment and finding medications that might be more effective to ease the symptoms of the disorder,\" Anderson said in a university news release.</p><p>One in every 59 children in the United States has an autism spectrum disorder, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They typically have difficulty with communication, repetitive behaviors and socializing. Symptoms may range from mild to severe.</p><p>According to study first author Jace King, the findings provide researchers \"with new tools to figure out the mechanisms that may underlie autism.\" King is  a postdoctoral research associate in the university's Brain Network Lab.</p><p>But Anderson said the team first needs to validate the results from this analysis in other groups of people. </p><p>The study was published online recently in <i>JAMA Network Open</i>.</p><p><b>More information</b></p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on <a href=\" https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/index.html \" target=\"_new\">autism</a>.</p>",
