These findings should provide some reassurance to them,\" Weibring said.</p><p>While the results are promising, further studies are needed \"and we still recommend sperm banking before orchiectomy as a number of patients may have low sperm counts at the time of diagnosis that persists after postoperative treatment,\" Weibring said.</p><p>Journal editor-in-chief Fabrice Andre is a professor in the department of medical oncology at the Institut Gustave Roussy, in France.

She's a postdoctoral researcher at McGill University in Montreal.</p><p>\"Just because we detect HPV DNA in the hand doesn't necessarily mean the viral particles are viable or that there is enough to cause an infection,\" she said in a university news release. \"The DNA might just have been deposited on the hand because a person recently had sex or touched their own genitals.\"</p><p>That's exactly what the researchers found. </p><p>For the study, Malagon and her colleagues enlisted hundreds of heterosexual partners who provided hand and genital samples every few months. Researchers analyzed the HPV DNA to see who became infected over time.</p><p>People were more likely to become infected when their partner was HPV-positive in the genitals or hands, the investigators found. But the risk was mostly attributable to genital HPV infection, the findings showed. </p><p>When researchers accounted for this, the risk of being infected by the hands disappeared.</p><p>This finding does not mean it's impossible to transmit HPV from hand-genital sex. But if this mode of infection occurs, the researchers haven't seen it, so it's unlikely, they explained.</p><p>Most sexually active adults will become infected with HPV at some point -- without even realizing it -- before their immune system clears the virus, said study co-author Eduardo Franco. He is chairman of the Gerald Bronfman Department of Oncology at McGill.</p><p>Condoms can reduce the risk, but they only provide partial protection from infection, he said. </p><p>\"The most effective prevention against infection and the cancers HPV causes is therefore vaccination,\" Franco said. In the United States, experts recommend that all girls and boys receive the HPV vaccine starting at age 11 or 12. It's also advised for young adults who did not get it when they were kids.</p><p>In addition, Franco noted, \"women can also get screened to prevent HPV infections from progressing to cervical cancer.\" </p><p>The report was recently published online in  <i>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</i> journal. </p> <p><b>More information</b></p><p>To learn more about HPV, visit the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv.htm/\" target=\"_blank\"> U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p></div>",

            "Body__c": "<div itemprop=\"articleBody\"><p>Here's a joke: A man tells his friend about a dinner party he had at his house the night before. \"I made a real Freudian slip,\" he says. \"I meant to tell my mother-in-law to pass the butter, and instead I said, \"You silly cow, you ruined my life!\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Is humor good for my health?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You've probably heard countless warnings about the dangers of negative emotions. Stress, anger, and depression can sap your immune system, encourage heart trouble, and slow your recovery from almost any illness. But how often do you hear the positive side of the story? Research consistently shows that positive emotions, including love, humor, and hope, may help your body fend off disease. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Norman Cousins, an editor of the Saturday Review, is sometimes called  \"the father of laughter therapy.\" He didn't feel particularly mirthful when he was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis, a crippling and intensely painful form of arthritis. But as he said in his 1979 book <i>The Anatomy of an Illness</i>, humor was definitely part of his recovery plan. </p>\r\n<p>Soon after the diagnosis, Cousins vowed to tackle his disease with confidence and laughter. He set up a movie projector in his hospital room and frequently watched Marx Brothers movies and classic episodes of \"Candid Camera.\" (On the downside, his constant laughter bothered some of the neighboring patients.) In between reels, he stayed upbeat and relaxed. Over a period of months, he regained motion in his joints and felt the pain disappear. He eventually made a nearly full recovery from his \"incurable\" disease. Cousins went on to help establish a department at the University of California at Los Angeles medical school that investigates the connection between illness and the mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What effect does humor have on the body?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How does humor foster healing? One clue came from a study at Loma Linda University School of Medicine. Researchers found that people who watched a funny 60-minute video experienced a significant drop in so-called stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. Scientists say these hormones can contribute to a wide range of stress-related illnesses including depression and heart disease. Other studies suggest regular doses of humor and laughter can enhance breathing and circulation and even stimulate T-cells, the vanguard of the immune system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Humor may also ease pain. Laughter can unleash a flood of natural painkillers called endorphins, and a good joke helps the mind focus on something besides pain. The effects might be dramatic: Cousins found that 10 minutes of belly laughs while watching Groucho gave him an extra two hours of pain-free sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2005, scientists from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore found another clue: Laughter may be tied to the healthy function of blood vessels. Laughter appears to cause the tissue in the inner lining of blood vessels, the endothelium, to dilate or expand in order to increase blood flow. The researchers also found that people with heart disease were 40 percent less likely to laugh in a variety of situations compared to people of the same age without heart disease.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>\"The endothelium is the first line in the development of atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries, so given the results of our study, it is conceivable that laughing may be important to maintain a healthy endothelium, and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease,\" said principal investigator Michael Miller, M.D., director of preventive cardiology at the University of Maryland Medical Center in a news release. \"At the very least, laughter offsets the impact of mental stress, which is harmful to the endothelium.\"</p>\r\n\r\n <p><b>What if I don't feel like laughing?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Humor may be healthy, but that doesn't mean you should brush aside grief and sadness. It's natural to cry at the discovery of a serious disease or the loss of a loved one. In fact, there's some evidence that brief periods of sorrow -- besides helping you express your emotions -- stimulate the immune system. But when these feelings become a way of life or give way to depression, any health benefits quickly fade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Can the mind overcome any illness?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Norman Cousins's story, and many others like it, make it seem as if the brain can conquer anything. These accounts have even made some ill patients feel guilty that they didn't use their minds to stay healthy. But some illnesses are so severe that no thoughts or emotions -- or shots or surgeries -- can restore health.  As the American Cancer Society points out, available scientific evidence does not support claims that laughter can cure cancer or any other disease, but it can reduce stress and enhance a person's quality of life. Keep an open mind and an optimistic attitude, but beware of people who promise complete cures through \"positive thinking.\" On the other hand, remember: A cure may be beyond your reach, but a joyful mind isn't.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b>References</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><small>\"Laughter is the Best Medicine for Your Heart,\" Maryland Medical Center, updated July 14, 2009.</small></p>\r\n\r\n<p><small>\"Laughter Helps Blood Vessels Function Better,\" University of Maryland, news release, March 7, 2005.</small></p>\r\n\r\n<p><small>American Cancer Society.

            "Body__c": "<div itemprop=\"articleBody\"><p>MONDAY, Feb. 25, 2019 (American Heart Association News) -- For years, Jan H. Mitchell felt terrible.</p> <p>\"The fatigue I was experiencing was unreal,\" said Mitchell, 62, of Paris, Tennessee. \"It was beyond feeling tired; I would come home from work and had no energy to do anything.\"</p> <p>Mitchell saw doctor after doctor. After a stress test, a sleep apnea assessment and other evaluations, one doctor sent her for a CT scan of her gallbladder. That's when the imaging technician spotted a tumor -- in her heart.</p> <p>The tumor was the size of a racquetball. Mitchell had immediate open-heart surgery to remove it in March 2009.</p> <p>Even though heart disease tops the list of the nation's leading causes of death -- ahead of cancer at No. 2 -- heart cancer is quite rare. One study suggests primary cardiac tumors -- those that develop in the heart itself -- affect 1.38 in 100,000 people each year.</p> <p>\"A heart surgeon may only experience one during his entire career, if ever,\" said Dr. Monika Leja, a cardio-oncology specialist at the University of Michigan Frankel Cardiovascular Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p> <p>Most heart tumors -- about 75 percent -- are benign, meaning they are not cancerous. Cancer that spreads to the heart from the lung, breast or elsewhere in the body is much more common. But when tumors begin in the heart, they \"are likely a result of genetic malformations, since the heart is not a common place for cancers to grow,\" Leja said.</p> <p>That's because of the heart's composition, said Dr. Scott Schuetze, director of the connective tissue oncology program at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center in Ann Arbor.</p> <p>The heart is made up of connective tissue, and cancer of that tissue is rare, Schuetze said. Rather, cancer more often arises in epithelial tissue that lines organs such as the prostate, breast, colon, pancreas, stomach, esophagus and skin.</p> <p>Instead, \"the heart is prone to disease that affects blood vessels, such as atherosclerotic disease and hypertension, because the heart is extremely dependent on blood flow for the work it does,\" Schuetze said.</p> <p>The heart also is susceptible, he said, to diseases that affect muscle or pumping function, as well as conditions that affect its electrical system.</p> <p>Because most heart tumors are benign, they are usually curable with surgery, said Dr. Michael Reardon, a cardiothoracic surgeon at Houston Methodist Hospital.</p> <p>Without surgery, \"the tumors can cause problems because pieces of them can break off and cause strokes,\" said Reardon.</p> <p>Malignant heart tumors are treated with chemotherapy or surgery, or sometimes both depending on the type of tumor.</p> <p>For Mitchell, surgery to remove the benign tumor caused her to develop a type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. Because the condition can cause blood clots, she was treated with a device to prevent them from traveling to the brain and causing a stroke.</p> <p>It has given the retired teacher peace of mind as she spends time with her husband, Joe, and their great-nieces and great-nephew. \"Park time is their favorite.\"</p> </div>",
